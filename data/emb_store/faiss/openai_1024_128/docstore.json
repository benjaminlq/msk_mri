Kransdorf, MD.s \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nAnkle injuries are the most common injury presenting to primary care and emergency rooms [1,2] , accounting for \n4.4% of United States emergency room visits  [3]. Acute ankle sprains (pain, swelling, limited mobility) make up \nthe majority of these injuries , with an estimated incidence of 2 million per year  [4]. Diagnosis of presence and \ndegree of sprain, fracture, subluxation, dislocation, cartilage abnormalities, foreign bodies , or neurovascular \ninvolvement are critical in determining appropriate and timely orthopedic fixation/treatme nt planning [1,5] and to \navoid chronic pain and immobility . Appropriate use of ankle imaging guidelines and clinical decision support \nmechanisms is paramount [6,7] . \nThe current standard clinical imaging guidelines to determine if radiographs are necessary are the Ottawa Ankle \nRules (OAR), instituted in 1992. The OAR have been vali dated for adults and children > 5 years of age  [8] and \nrecommend ankle radiographs in patients with the following clinical criteria in the acute setting: 1) inability to bear  \nweight,  2) point tenderness over the medial malleolus, the posterior edge or inferior tip of the lateral malleolus, \ntalus, or calca neus, or 3) inability to ambulate for 4 steps.  For the purposes of this paper, the OAR will still apply \nduring the first 1- to 3-week interval following initial injury. Multiple validation studies have confirmed OAR \neffectiveness and utility in obtaining a ppropriate imaging, reducing unnecessary radiographs and costs, and \nimproving clinical outcomes  [8-13]. \nTwo recent meta -analyses concluded that the OAR are the most accurate in excluding fractures in the acute ankle \nsetting with sensitivity of 92 % to 100% with specificity of 16 % to 51% , respectively  [13,14] . Including an added \ncriterion of swelling has been shown to increase the sensitivity and specificity for fracture to 100% and 55% for the \nmalleolar region. Recent implementation of nurse triage programs using the radiographic OAR protocol have shown  \na reduction in emergency r oom patient stay by up to 20 minutes  [3,15-17] . In an effort to decrease the use of \nradiographs , other rules, including the Bernese Ankle Rules,  have been evaluated but have shown lower sensitivity \nto the OAR [18,19] . Evidence -based clinical treatment guidelines and systematic review of economic analyses \nsupport the role of radiography in evaluation of select patients suspected of having an ankle fracture with a limited \nrole of cross-sectional imaging primarily as a tool for preoperative planning and as a problem -solving technique in \npatients with persisten t symptoms and suspected of occult fracture [5,6,20-23] . \nApplication of the OAR for evaluation of acute trauma to the foot is reported in  the ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae \ntopic on \u201c Acute Trauma to the Foot \u201d [24].", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "87826fef-06f9-4d94-a623-b8ce806bb843": {"__data__": {"id_": "87826fef-06f9-4d94-a623-b8ce806bb843", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "ACR Acute trauma to ankle.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a5e52a68-fbd2-409a-818a-6da5f2715c9c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "ACR Acute trauma to ankle.pdf"}, "hash": "ddf019bba12599173c0f862f04acdc8364245c071ce1a1d3fc2865487b05d795"}, "2": {"node_id": "039783ab-073f-4d8c-8dd8-01ba8fb7faa1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "ACR Acute trauma to ankle.pdf"}, "hash": "3b0acdc53e2efb9fbe133834fa582d77b08f4b2fabb3aa5f2df3af0ed6eee497"}}, "hash": "bf597a65724c96b879a83d15e3710e2c61cd786be60c70cc100ac2b4152800c9", "text": "Application of the OAR for evaluation of acute trauma to the foot is reported in  the ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae \ntopic on \u201c Acute Trauma to the Foot \u201d [24]. \nExclusionary Criteria  \nOAR should not be used in children < 5 years of age or in those patients with a neurologic abnormality affecting the \nlower leg with decreased sensation ( eg, diabetic), altered sensorium, or inability to communicate [8,25,26] .

Advances in MRI \ntechnology have facilitated short dedicated extremity MRI protocols in so me centers that may be used as an \nemergent adjunct to radiographs  [28]. \nInitial Imaging Definition \nImaging at the beginning of the care episode for the medical condition defined by the variant. More than one \nprocedure can be considered usually appropriate in the initial imaging evaluation when:  \n\u2022 There are procedures that are equivalent alternatives (ie,  only one procedure will be ordered to \nprovide the clinical information to effectively manage the patient\u2019s care)  \nOR \n\u2022 There are complementary procedures (ie, more than one procedure is ordered as a set or \nsimultaneously in which  each procedure provides uniq ue clinical information to effectively manage \nthe patient\u2019s care).  \nDiscussion of Procedures by Variant  \nVariant 1: Adult or child 5 years of age or older. Acute trauma to the ankle or acute trauma to the ankle \nwith persistent pain for more than 1 week but less than 3 weeks. No exclusionary criteria present. Initial \nimaging. Patient meets the requirements for evaluation by the Ottawa Ankle Rules which are positive:  \n1. Inability to bear weight immediately after the injury, OR  \n2. Point tenderness over the medial mall eolus, the posterior edge or inferior tip of the lateral malleolus, \ntalus, or calcaneus, OR  \n3. Inability to ambulate for 4 steps in the emergency department.  \nBone Scan Ankle  \nBone scan is not routinely used as the first imaging study for the evaluation of acute trauma to the ankle with \npositive OAR.  \nCT Ankle   \nAlthough CT may be used in polytrauma patients to determine the extent of injury in complex fractures, CT is not \nroutinely used as the first imaging study of acute trauma to the ankle with positive OAR when excl usionary criteria \ndo not apply.  \nMRI Ankle  \nAlthough MRI may be used for occult injuries or suspicion for ligamentous tears in inversion injuries  [29], it is not \nthe first imagin g study  for the evaluation of acute trauma to the ankle with positive OAR . \nRadiography Ankle  \nRadiographs are indicated in patients who meet OAR criteria as the initial imaging study. Studies demonstrate \nbetween 92% and 99% sensitivity for detecting ankle fracture using these guidelines,  with <2% of those who are \nnegative for fracture using the OAR actually having a fracture [13-15,30] . The OAR are validated in children >5 \nyears of age and should not be used in pati ents meeting  the exclusionary criteria listed above [8]. Typical \nradiographic protocol s should include 3 standard views : anteroposterior,  lateral , and mortise views to include the \nbase of the fifth metatarsal bone distal to the tuberosity  [31]. Althou gh foot and ankle radiographs have been \nperformed together in clinical settings in the past, in a retrospective study of 243 patients with both radiographs \nperformed, no foot fractures other than the base of the fifth  metatarsal were noted. In the presence  of inversion \ninjury or fracture of the ankle, foot or knee radiographs should not be performed owing to low yield [32,33] . \nWeight -bearing radiographs, if possible, provide important information, particularly with fractures of uncertain \nstability, because the most important criterion in treatment of malleolar fractures is stability. A medial clear space \nof <4 mm should confirm stability. Increased incidence of fracture and instabilit y is noted with medial tenderness, \nbruising or swelling, fibular fracture above the syndesmosis, bi - or trimalleolar fractures, open fracture,  or high-\nenergy fracture injury  [34].

It may be of use when further evaluation of the fracture is needed.  \n\u2022 Bicycle spoke injuries in children : These injuries are unusual but can occur with entrapment of the leg in the \nspokes of the bicycle wheel. In a study by Slaar et al [35], if no fracture is noted on ankle radiographs , then  no \nfurther imaging is warranted .

Occasionally, m ultidetector C T can be useful as \nfirst-line imaging study, particularly for complex injuries such as posterior malleolar fracture and posterior pilon \nvariant fractures,  which fall outside the  typical classification systems.  In a study of 270 patients by Switaj et al [41], \nthe frequency of posterior malleolus fractures and posterior pilon variants was 50% and 20% , respectively;  both \nwere found more com monly in older females and diabetic  patients . Recent studies of use and implementation of \nlow-dose weight -bearing cone beam CT, particularly in the pediatric population, may be a viable alternative to \nstandard CT studies [42]. \nMRI Ankle  \nMRI is not routine ly used as the first imaging study for the evaluation of acute trauma to the ankle in the setting of \nperipheral neuropathy or neurological disorder  or other exclusionary criteria.  \nRadiography Ankle  \nIn patients wi th diabetic neuropathy, neurologic compromise of the lower leg , or other exclusionary criteria in which \napplication of the OAR  is not possible  and fracture is suspected, ankle radiographs  are considered the initial imaging \nstudy. These patients may have no pain or point tenderness and may w alk without discomfort despite fracture \nbecause of  poor pain proprioception [25].

Because there is a wide range of radiation exposures associated with \ndifferent diagnostic procedures, a relative radiation level (RRL) indication has been included for each imaging \nexamination. The RRLs are based on effective dose, which is a radiation dose quantity that is used to estimate \npopulation total radiation risk associated with an imaging procedure. Patients in the pedia tric age group are at \ninherently higher risk from exposure, because of both organ sensitivity and longer life expectancy (relevant to the \nlong latency that appears to accompany radiation exposure).

Kransdorf, MD.o \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nHand injuries account for approximately 20% of emergency department visits [ 1]. According to the National \nHospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey , 1.5% of all emergency department visits involve  hand and wrist \nfractu res. Distal radius fractures are especially common, accounting for up to 18% of fractures in the elderly [ 2,3]. \nBecause of increasing rates of osteoporosis, the incidence of distal radius fractures has been increasing [ 4]. \nAlthough most distal radius fractures in e lderly patients are managed non operatively, the use of internal fixation is \nincreasing. Internal fixation has a much higher cost than nonopera tive treatment as well as increased rates of \nhospitalization [5]. \nFor most patients with trauma to the hand and wrist, conventional radiographs provide sufficient diagnostic \ninformation to guide the treating physician.  However, delayed diagnosis is common because distal radius and \nscaphoid fractures may be radiographically occult  [6]. When initial radiographs  are normal but there is high \nclinical suspicion for fracture, further imaging with additional radiographic pr ojections, CT, or MRI  is \nappropriate . If associated soft -tissue injury is clinically suspected, CT, CT arthrography, MR I, MR arthrography, \nor ultrasound (US) may be indicated  [7-10]. \nSuccessful treatment of distal radius fractures requires restoration of radial length, inclination, and tilt, as well as \nthe realignment of the articular fracture fragments [9,11]. The presence of a coronally  oriented fracture line, die -\npunch depression, or more than three articular fracture fragments are common indications for operative reduction \n[8]. Operative fixation resulting in < 2 mm of residual articular surface step-off is usually considered necessary to \navoid long-term complications , such as osteoarthritis [9 ,12]. \nDiscussion of Procedures by Variant  \nVariant 1: Acute blunt or penetrating trauma to the hand or wrist. Initial imaging.  \nRadiograph y Area of Interest  \nRadiography is  always indicated as the initial imaging for suspected acute hand and wrist trauma.  For m ost joints \nof the extremities, especially those involving the wrist, hand, and fingers, a radiographic examination that \nincludes only 2 views is not adequate for detecting fractures [13]. For patients with suspected  distal radius \nfractures, a 3-view examination  of the wrist  usually includes a posteroanterior (PA) , a lateral, and a 45\u00b0 \nsemi pronated oblique view  [11]. One study [ 14] reports that a fourth projection\u2014a semisupinated oblique \u2014\nincreases diagnostic yield for distal radius fractures.  \nA standard 3 -view radiographic examination of the hand shows most fractures and dislocations of the metacarpals \nand phalanges [ 13]. For phalangeal injuries, some centers include a PA examination of the entire hand, whereas \nothers limit the examination to the injured finger.  An internally rotated oblique project ion, in addition to the \nstandard externally rotated oblique, increases diagnostic yield for phalangeal fractures [15]. \n                                                 \naResearch Author, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston Salem, North Carolina.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dbe4288e-8a0d-40f6-9ee9-50145ac678c5": {"__data__": {"id_": "dbe4288e-8a0d-40f6-9ee9-50145ac678c5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "ACR acute hand and wrist trauma.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6f8cb1d4-017e-4927-8529-803fcfbd40a1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "ACR acute hand and wrist trauma.pdf"}, "hash": "ef1bfbbcb09ccb8fb1d28843259631a145f1498dc7d96ec10244031c352f6381"}, "2": {"node_id": "e4908ab2-3126-4723-a380-4f6e84c08447", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "ACR acute hand and wrist trauma.pdf"}, "hash": "b6a064a576d91f0a0567908c10c2f1cec7f4002a6a673d4ca9a2f27dd20bf0ee"}}, "hash": "43796f869cd6bf950988191c824c7da0b468de0026163b8a0566ed20ff808362", "text": "An internally rotated oblique project ion, in addition to the \nstandard externally rotated oblique, increases diagnostic yield for phalangeal fractures [15]. \n                                                 \naResearch Author, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston Salem, North Carolina. bWake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston \nSalem, North Carolina. cPanel Chair, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky. dPanel Vice- Chair, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida. eNorthwestern \nMemorial Hospital, Chicago, Illinois; American College of Physicians. fUK Healthcare Spine and Total Joint Service, Lexington, Kentucky; American \nAcademy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. gRadiology  Imaging Associates, Denver, Colorado. hWashington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri. \niBrigham & Women\u2019s Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts. jRoswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York. kDavid Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, \nLos An geles, California. lUniversity of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia. mMayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida. nPenn State Milton S.

Radiographs are usually sufficient for  the evaluation \nof osseous \u201cmallet\u201d injuries, which include bony avulsion at the insertion of the extensor mechanism of the finger \nto the distal interphalangeal joint [16]. In these injuries, involvement of more than one -third of the articular \nsurface usually requires operative fixation.  Palmar displacement of the distal phalanx or an interfragmentary gap \nof >3 mm is also an indication for surgery [ 16]. With extensor tendon injuries, radiographs are commonly used to \nassess for bone involve ment and determine need for operative fixation [ 17]. \nCT Area of Interest  \nIn patients with intra -articular fractures seen on radiography , CT shows articular fracture fragment displacement, \ndepression, and comminution more accurately than conventional radiographs [ 7,9,10]. CT measurements of \narticular surface gap and step -off are more reproducible than radiographs [7]. The addition of 3- D surface -\nrendered reconstructions to the standard 2 -D CT images has been shown to change operative management in up to \n48% of intra -articular distal radius fractures [8]. \nThere is no evidence to support the use of CT with intravenous  (IV) contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist \ntrauma.  \nMRI Area of Interest  \nMRI is not indicated initially in this clinical setting. \nUS Area of Interest  \nUS is not indicated initially in this clinical setting. \nBone Scan Area of  Interest  \nBone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  \nVariant 2: Suspect acute hand or wrist trauma. Initial radiographs nega tive or equivocal. Next imaging \nstudy. \nRadiograph y Area of Interest  \nIn patients with clinical suspicion of hand or wrist fracture and negative radiographs, one option is to place the \npatient in a short arm cast and repeat the radiographs at 10  to 14 days [ 13]. The downside of this option is that it \nresults in delay of diagnosis , which may lead to functional impairment . \nCT Area of Interest  \nWhen the initial radiographs are equivocal, CT  without IV contrast  is commonly used to exclude or confirm \nsuspected wrist fractures [18]. CT shows intra-articular extension of distal radius fractures more frequently than \nradiography.  Three-dimensional reconstructions can be particularly helpful in preoperative planning for complex \narticular injuries  [7,8]. \nCT should be used to exclude an occult fracture of the upper extremity. Unlike MRI, CT cannot evaluate for \nconcomitant ligamentous injuries  [19-21 ]. \nCT is useful in diagnosing injuries that are difficult to recognize on radiographs, such as carpometacarpal joint \nfracture dislocations. For metacarpal and digital  fractures, CT is usually not indicated during acute injury [ 22]. \nThere is no evidence to support the use of CT with IV contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist trauma.  \nMRI Area o f Interest  \nWhen initial radiographs are normal but there is high clinical suspicion for fracture, MRI without IV contrast can \ndetect fractures of the distal radius and carpal bones [12,23-25] . One study of patients in which the radiographic \nfindings did not explain the clinical symptoms reported that the MRI led to a change in diagnosis in 55% of \npatients and a change in patient management in 66%  [12]. However, another study of patients with acutely injured \nwrists reported that the MRI did not predict the need for treatment better than the combination of physical \nexamination and radiography [ 23]. More importantly, there was no difference in outcomes  with MRI compared \nwith radiography [24].", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3576e395-76fe-4f89-8241-87379146c70b": {"__data__": {"id_": "3576e395-76fe-4f89-8241-87379146c70b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "ACR acute hand and wrist trauma.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "84511868-f9a6-428d-b3bd-16e9380df0c5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "ACR acute hand and wrist trauma.pdf"}, "hash": "54e5cb8f6008f7fd58ca7394a0056ce1cf792da71636578d2398b19623d85462"}, "3": {"node_id": "68be93d0-24a5-488f-b3af-02654f82b897", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "ACR acute hand and wrist trauma.pdf"}, "hash": "2a96ad9c5aade83254852906047e9776b6e6c5b47cd44cb56515f10444fc754e"}}, "hash": "b94e78516b1f1cfc32ec627f427dd1fb72e2b9f68e9b58b69c1e7f45752d3edc", "text": "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 6 Acute Hand and Wrist Trauma  Like CT, MRI shows intra -articular extension of distal radius fractures more frequently than radiography.  Unlike \nCT, MRI shows concomitant ligament  injuries, including tears of the scapholunate ligament, which may affect \nsurgical treatment [26,27]. Despite these advantages,  MRI performed immediately at the time of injury has little \nadded value for determining which patients go on to surgery [ 23]. \nMRI is especially useful in evaluating  hand soft -tissues injuries, including the collateral ligaments, volar plates, \ntendons, and pulleys. For metacarpal and digital fractures, MRI is usually not indicated during acute injury [ 22]. \nThere is no evidence to support the use of MRI with IV contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist trauma.  \nUS Area of Interest  \nUS may have a limited utility  for evaluating bone injuries. Christiansen et al  [28] reported 47% sensitivity and \n61% specificity of US  for the detection of scaphoid fractures . They concluded that US  is not suitable for the early \ndiagnosis of scaphoid fracture.  In contrast, Hauger et al  [29] reported that using cortical disruption as a diagnostic \ncriterion on US is an accurate sign for detecting occult fractures of the scaphoid waist. Further study of US  for the \ndiagnosis of occult fractures is needed . \nBone Scan Area of  Interest  \nBone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  \nVariant 3: Acute wrist fracture on radiographs. Suspect wrist tendon or ligament trauma. Next imaging \nstudy. \nRadiography Wrist  \nAssessment of carpal instability with conventional radiographs requires careful attention to radiographic \npositioning.  In low -grade injuries, radiographs are usually normal.  Scapholunate diastasis of >4 mm and dorsal til t \nof the lunate of > 10\u00b0 suggests dorsal intercalated segmental instability  [30,31]. Lunotriquetral dias tasis with \nscapholunate angle < 30\u00b0 and capitolunate angle of > 30\u00b0 suggests volar intercalated segmental instability  [30]. \nCT Arthrography  Wrist  \nWhen conventional radiographs do not show carpal malalignment, CT arthrography may be used to diagnose \nligamentous tears,  causing dynamic instability [ 32,33]. There is a g rowing body of literature comparing the \ndiagnostic accuracy of MR I (at 1.5T or 3T), MR arthrography (indirect or direct at 1.5T  or 3T) , and CT \narthrography.  Overall , CT arthrography is reported to have the highest sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.  \nFor the detection of scapholunate ligament tear, CT arthrography has sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of \nnearly 100%.  For the detection of lunotriquetral ligament tear, CT arthrography has approximately 100% \nsensitivity, 80% specificity, and 90% accuracy.

Spaeth et al [ 63] reported a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 94% for detection of displaced ulnar \ncollateral ligament tears in 16 cadaveric specimens.  \nUS Hand  \nA Stener lesion occurs when the aponeurosis of the adductor pollicis muscle becomes interposed between the \nruptured ulnar collateral ligament of the thumb and its site  of insertion at the base of the proximal phalanx. This \nlesion can be identified by absence of ulnar collateral ligament and the presence of a hypoechoic mass proximal to \nthe apex of the metacarpal tubercle [64]. Dynamic examination shows the relationship of the aponeurosis to the \nretracted ligament stump [65] . \nUS allows for diagnosis of pulley system injuries [ 66,67]. \nBone Scan Hand \nBone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  \nVariant 6: Initial radiographs showing metaca rpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, or distal \ninterphalangeal joint malalignment in the absence of fracture.

MRI may be used to assess \ncapsule and collateral ligament injuries of the proximal interphalangeal  and metacarpophalangeal joints [68]. \nFor flexor tendon injuries, Rubin et al [ 69] reported a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of  100% in cadavers.  \nDrap\u00e9 et al  [58] reported sensitivity and specificity of 100% for diagnosis of tendon re -tears after flexor tend on \nrepair and a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 100% for diagnosis of peritendinous adhesions in 63 injured \nfingers.  Jersey finger refers to avulsion injury of flexor digitorum profundus from  insertion at base of distal \nphalanx. In patients with jers ey finger, MRI is commonly used to evaluate the level of tendon retraction, the \nquality of the tendon stump, and the associated injuries including pulley injuries [16]. In clinically equivocal \ncases, MRI may demonstrate injury to the central slip or the extensor hood [ 16]. \nMRI allows for the assessment of pulley system lesions [ 66,67]. MRI can accurately depict the pulley system, \nparticularly the A2 and A4 pulleys, with lower sensitivity for A3 and A5 pulleys [ 70].

Kransdorf,  MD.o  \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nFractures of the proximal femur (commonly referred to as hip fractures)  are a frequent  source of morbidity and \nmortality in elderly osteoporotic patients [1]. Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type \nresult in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men \n[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs \nwill continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of \nlife following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays \nin diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -\nand long-term mortality [6-13]. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of hip fractures is critical. Hip fractures \ncannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded on the basis of physical exam ination  alone ; therefore , imaging plays a \nkey role in early  and accurate diagnosis [14] . \nThe biomechanics of proximal femoral and pelvic fractures that are a result of major trauma differs as these \ninjuries may be seen in any age group, often with additional accompanying high-velocity injuri es of the abdomen \nand pelvis . Motor vehicle \u2013related trauma is the most common  mechanism. Thorough evaluation of the hip may be \nsuperseded  in these instances by the need for resuscitation and diagnosis and treatment of more urgent associated \nvascular or solid organ injuries. Imaging plays an important role not only in the diagnosis of high-velocity \nfractures but also in characterizing fracture mechanism and morphology for treatment planning purposes.  \nHowever, imaging of high-velocity hip fractures occurs in the context of a broader trauma evaluation. A full \ndiscussion of the broader imaging workup of blunt trauma is beyond the scope of this paper and will be covered in \nthe upcoming ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae titled \u201cMajor Blunt Trauma\u201d and will be made available on the \nACR website  when completed . \nTreatment  for both intra - and extracapsular proximal femoral fractures in the elderly is typically surgical fixation  \nbecause of the risk of further fracture displacement and the dangers of prolonged immobilization in the elderly \n[15]. Joint replacement may be  performed for displaced fractures of the femoral neck where the risk of femoral \nhead avascular necrosis is high. Fractures from high -force trauma are also commonly treated with surgical \nfixation for stability to reduce the risk of post -traumatic osteo arthritis. \nDiscussion of Procedures by Variant  \nVariant 1:  Acute hip pain.

The frog -leg view \nhas been disc ouraged in patients with suspected fractures given concern that the required patient positioning will \nlead to further fracture displacement [15,17] . One small retrospective study evaluated the benefit of an oblique AP \nview with 30 \u00b0 of lateral tube angulation to better profile the femoral neck , but this led to only a small increase in \nsensitivity and , in some cases,  resulted in obscuration of the femoral neck by the posterior wall of the acetabulum \n[19]. Thus,  standard AP and cross-table lateral views have remained  the mainstay for trauma a ssessment of the \nhip. \nMultiple studies have demonstrated that radiographs have limited sensitivity for fracture detection of the proximal \nfemur, particularly in elderly osteoporotic patients [20-24]. All of these studies constitute retrospective series in \nwhich patients with negative radiographs but high clinical suspicion went on to receive a MRI scan at the \ndiscretion of the evaluating clinician. In one such study, 14% of patients with negative rad iographs were found to \nhave fractures of the hip or pelvis  [23]. In this same study, Kirby et al  [23] also reported 12% of patients with \nsuspicious radiographs were found to have no fracture on MRI , illustrating limitations in the specificity of \nradiographs as well. Other studies have had more dra matic results,  with Sankey et al  [25] reporting 83 of 98 \npatients to have fractures after negative radiographs, 23 of whom required operative management . The variability  \nis likely due to differing proportions of patients going on to MRI following negative radiographs in these \nretrospective studies.  However , there is no accepted clinical decision rule to guide when patients with suspected \nhip fracture should have advanced imaging after negative radiographs. A new inability to bear weight is a \nclinically suspicious finding , although the sensitivity and specificity of this is unknown  [20]. Allowing for \nvariation between studies, the estimated prev alence of occult fracture after negative radiographs has  been \nestimated  at 4% to 10% , indicating the inability of negative radiographs alone to exclude fracture [21,26] . Risk \nfactors for radiographically occult fracture in these studies included those age >65, low -force trauma,  such as a \nground-level fall , and female gender. These studies have almost exclusively included elderly patients.  There is no \nrelevant literature regarding the sensitivity and specificity of radiographs in the younger patient population,  and \nclinicians are suggested to proceed with caution.  \nRadiography Pelvis  \nThere is no specific literature  regarding the use of an AP view of the pelvis  alone  for acute hip pain following \nlow-force trauma.  Previous literature regarding the accuracy of radiography has almost exclusively evaluated AP \nand cross-table lateral radiographs of the hip or the combined use of AP pelvis and hip radiographs. However, i t is \nwell established that patients with clinically  suspected proximal femur fracture often have fractures of the pelvis,  \nincluding the sacrum and pubic rami [21,27-30] . Therefore , it has been  recommended that the radiographic series \ninclude the AP view of the pelvis along with the orthogonal  views  of the symptomatic hip [31] . The inclusion of a \npelvis radiograph also allows for comparison of potential abnormalities to the contralateral asymptomatic side.  \nPelvis radiographs share the same limitations in sensitivity  and specificity  for fracture detection as hip \nradiographs , and a negative radiograph alone cannot exclude fracture . \nRadiography Pelvis and Hip \nAs previously discussed, p atients with clinically suspected proximal femur fracture often have fractures of the \npelvis  that includ e the sacrum and pubic rami [21,27- 30].

An early study by Quinn et al  [37] found MRI to be 100% accurate for fracture \ndetection in patients with indeterminate radiographs using clinical outcomes as the gold standard. A s ubsequent \nstudy by Pandey et  al [38] found no missed fractures in 10 of 33 patients with negative MRIs , all of whom were \nfollowed clinically for at least 6 mo nths. A 2008 study showed 99% sensitivity of MRI, both for proximal femoral \nfractures and fractures of the pelvis [39] . With multiple studies indicating near 100% sensitivity for proximal \nfemoral fracture, it has been suggested that a negative MRI may allow for confident discharge from the \nemergency department and reduce the number of cautionary admissions [23,29] . Conversely, rapid diagnosis of \nsurgical fractures reduces delay to treatment  with associated improved  outcomes [10]. \nSeveral additional studies have also shown  high diagnostic a ccuracy for diagnosis of both pelvis fractures and \nsoft-tissue injuries in addition to fractures of the proximal femur [28,30,39] . This versatility is important as many \nseries have shown a high incidence of extrafemoral trauma in patients with acute hip pain and negative \nradiographs. For exampl e, in the study by Ohishi et al  [30], of 113 patients , 38% had fractures of the proximal \nfemur and 33% had fractures of t he pelvis.  In another retrospective series, Dominguez et al  [21] found pelvic \nfractures to be more common than proximal femur fractures in this patient population,  emphasizing the \nimportance of accuracy in the assessment of extrafem oral trauma . Although many of these pelvic fractures and \nsoft-tissue injuries may not be treated surgically , correct diagnosis allows for appropriate conservative treatment , \nincluding protected weight -bearing, pain  control, deep vein thrombosis  prophylaxis, and skilled rehabilitation.  \nIn addition to its increased sensitivity for fracture detection, MRI has been shown to be useful in characterizing \nfracture morpholog y. Seemingly isolated fractures of the greater trochanter diagnosed on radiography frequent ly \nhave intertrochanteric extension when evaluated with MRI [22]. In a classic stud y of 30 patients, Schultz et al  \n[40] demonstrated the use of MRI to accurately depict the extent of the fracture line in these radiographically \noccult intertrochanteric fractures.

Rather , the interest has been in \nthe use of dynamic MRI to evaluate femoral head perfusion for prognostic purpose to estimate the risks of \nimpaired perfusion,  such as osteonecrosis and non union. In one study of 36 patients, impaired femoral head \nperfusion was mor e common in patients with displaced fractures,  although there was considerable overlap of \nperfusion pattern and fracture type [44]. The accuracy of predicting successful osseous union was 75% based on \nfracture morphology and improved incrementally to 89% on the basis of perfusion dynamics. Only 2 of 16 \npatients with nondisplaced fractures had osteonecrosis. A study from 2009 had similar results with  90% accuracy \nfor prediction of successful fracture union on the basis of femoral head perfusion [45]. However, the study \nidentified on ly 1 patient with a nondisplaced fracture with impaired femoral head perfusion and did not specify \nwhether this patient went on to osteonecrosis, nor was the accuracy of predicting osteonecrosis on the basis of \nfemoral head perfusion compared to that of the well -established Garden classification system. Given these \nfindings, it is not clear if contrast-enhanced MRI offers significant advantages in the evaluation of the fractured \nhip compared to existing classification systems.  \nCT Pelvis and Hips  \nCT has advantages over MRI in terms of speed as well as use in patients with significant confusion. There has \nbeen considerable investigation into the accuracy  of noncontrast CT for detection of radiographically occult \nproximal femoral fractures,  although these studies have been invariably retrospective in nature, have used \ninconsistent methodology, and at times produced conflicting results . In one study of 199 patients, CT was \nnegative  for fracture  in 93 patients,  and none were found to have undiscovered f ractures at 4 -month clinical \nfollow -ups [34]. Another similar study with 68 patients  found no missed fractures in 27 patients with negative CT \nscans,  although it was not clear if clin ical follow -up was as comprehensive [46]. However, a number of other \nstudies have demonstrated potential limitations in the sensitivity of CT. For example, Haubro et al [26] found a \nsensitivity for CT of 87% compared with 100% for MRI , with CT missing 6 of 15 fractures . Another larger study \nof 129 cases compared MRI and CT for the diagnosis of both proximal femoral and pelvic fractures and found a \nsensitivity of 99% for MRI and 69% for CT using clinical outcomes and follow -up imaging as the gold standard \n[39]. This same study by Cabarrus et al  [39] also found MRI to be substantially better at detecting soft -tissue  \nabnormalities with 99% sensitivity for MRI and 13% sensitivity edema , and the differences in sensitivity for  more \nsignificant injuries , such as hematoma or tendon avulsion,  may be somewhat less. Several  other similar studies \ncomparing CT and MRI have also shown decreased sensitivity of CT with  potential for missed fractures as well as \nchanges in diagnosis and management when MRI is obtained after CT [24,47,48] . \nThere is no relevant data to support the use of contrast -enhanced CT solely for the purpose of fracture detection \nfollowing negative radiographs . However, if contrast -enhanced CT examination of the abdomen and pelvis is \nperformed because of suspicion of concurrent intra -abdominal trauma, bone algorithm  reconstruction of the pelvis \nand hips may be performed rather than performing a separate examination.  \nThere is no relev ant data to support the use of multiphase CT for the detection of fractures of the pelvis and \nproximal femur.  \nDual -energy CT is a more recent technology that has the ability to produce virtual noncalcium images for the \ndetection of bone marrow edema.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a8378822-8d12-480f-bb78-583f60e0bad0": {"__data__": {"id_": "a8378822-8d12-480f-bb78-583f60e0bad0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "ACR acute hip pain suspected fracture.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f72f70ec-f7f6-4361-8be9-b63534e984b9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "ACR acute hip pain suspected fracture.pdf"}, "hash": "7a9b809124dde975446a952d0f0640757752db19d1c8b38512a023bfaafbcbfc"}, "2": {"node_id": "9663f85b-6a75-46b9-bd68-c84ffe6f4365", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "ACR acute hip pain suspected fracture.pdf"}, "hash": "ea038b967db0ba3b9407a94f101777429e5c3557ab72d3c6f4bd017bd70376ce"}}, "hash": "702c6be52c8f1ad3bd0d63625825715e49705ec95ef1f35e9238d7c1298feda4", "text": "However, if contrast -enhanced CT examination of the abdomen and pelvis is \nperformed because of suspicion of concurrent intra -abdominal trauma, bone algorithm  reconstruction of the pelvis \nand hips may be performed rather than performing a separate examination.  \nThere is no relev ant data to support the use of multiphase CT for the detection of fractures of the pelvis and \nproximal femur.  \nDual -energy CT is a more recent technology that has the ability to produce virtual noncalcium images for the \ndetection of bone marrow edema.

However, as early as 1993 , Rizzo et al [50] demonstrated MRI to be at least as accurate as bone scan s \nand with substantially decreased time to diagnosis. A later study by  Rubin et al [51] comparing bone scan s and \nMRI demonstrated i mproved sensitivity and specificity of MRI relative to bone scans . Moreover, t he bone scan \ngroup averaged an additional day to surgery.  \nBone scintigraphy is a time-consuming process. Bone scans may be falsely negative for up to 72 hours from the \ntime of in jury, and false-positive scans are likewise common, related to osteoarthritis, soft -tissue injury , or any \nother process that may increase bone turnover [50] . It has been postulated that performing single -photon emission \ncomputed tomography may combine the sensitivity of bone scintig raphy with the spatial accuracy of CT , but there \nare no data to support this view. In current practice, the role of bone scan s as a secondary line of imaging in \npatients with contraindications to MRI has largely been usurped by CT.  \nSummary of Recommendations \n\u2022 Variant 1:  Radiographs  of the hip, radiographs  of the pelvis, or radiographs  of the pelvis and hips is usually \nappropriate for the initial imaging of the hip with acute pain, fall or minor trauma, and suspected fracture.  \n\u2022 Variant 2:  MRI pelv is and affected hip without IV contrast  or CT pelvis and hips without IV contrast is \nusually appropriate as the next imaging study for the evaluation of a cute hip pain from a fall or minor trauma  \nwith negative radiographs  and suspected fracture.  \nSupporting  Documents  \nThe evidence table, literature search, and appendix for this topic are available at https://acsearch.acr.org/list .

Kransdorf,  MD.q \nSummary  of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nAcute injuries  to the foot are frequently  encountered  in the setting  of the emergency  room  and in general  practice.  \nThe clinical  indications  for imaging  (known as the Ottawa rules)  have  been  developed  to minimize  unnecessary  \nradiographs , and their utility  is well documented by multiple  studies.  The most  commonly  accepted  form  of these  \nrules is the following:  \nA series of foot radiographs  is required  only if there  is pain in the midfoot  and any one of the \nfollowing:  1) point  bone  tenderness of the navicular;  2) point  bone  tenderness of the base of the fifth \nmetatarsal;  or 3) inability  to bear weight  or to walk  4 steps (immediately  after the injury  or at the \nemergency  department) . \nA meta -analysis (10 studies  encompassing  3,725  patients)  of the Ottawa rules for the foot showed  that these rules  \nhave  a sensitivity  of 99% and a median  specificity  of 26% for combined  evaluation  of the ankle  and midfoot  [1]. \nThe Ottawa rules for the ankle  and midfoot  have  been  shown  to be effective for the pediatric  population (>5 years \nof age) [2]. Including  the added  criterion  of swelling  yields  a sensitivity  and specificit y for fracture of 100%  and \n55% for the malleolar  zone and 50% and 40% for the midfoot,  respectively  [3,4] . \nExclusionary Criteria  \nMultiple  conditions  or scenarios preclude  the use of the Ottawa rules for determining  if imaging  is necessary  \n[5,6] . It has been  reported  that the Ottawa rules  for the foot should not be used or should be used with great  \ncaution  in the following  clinical  situations:  penetrating  trauma,  pregnancy,  any skin wound,  transferred  with \nradiographs  already  taken,  >10 days after trauma,  a return  visit for continued  traumatic  foot pain,  in the setting  of \npolytrauma,  altered  sensorium,  neurologic  abnormality  affecting  the foot, or underlying  bone  disease [7]. \nOther  clinical  scenarios of foot trauma  not directly  addressed  by the Ottawa rules  include  trauma  to the metatarsal  \nheads and toes and penetrating  trauma  with concern  for a foreign  body  in the soft tissues.  Also,  there is little in the \nliterature  on medical  decision  making of when  to order  a radiographic  study  of the toes [8]. \nDiscussion  of Procedures  by Variant  \nVariant  1: Adult  or child older  than  5 years of age.

The Ottawa rules for acute  trauma  to the foot are fairly  well established  and have  been  validated  by \nmultiple  institutional trials  verifying  the 99% sensitivity  in determining the presence of a foot fracture  [1,9,10] . \nThe more  serious potential  problems  in determining  the need  for imaging occurs in the patient who does not meet  \nthe inclusion  criteria  for imaging by the Ottawa rules of the foot. These inclusionary  criteria  are stated  in the \nIntroduction/ Background section  [5,6] ; added criterion  of swelling  increases sensitivity  and specificity  [3,4] . One \nshould carefully  evaluate the patient  to make  sure they do not meet  any of the exclusionary  criteria  before  \nimplementing  the Ottawa rules.  Radiographs  may be appropriate  in certain  clinical  scenarios  when  Ottawa  rules  \ncannot  be applied.  Also,  trauma  to the distal  forefoot  (metatarsal  heads and toes)  is not directly  addressed  by the \nOttawa rules . In general,  if a fracture  of a toe is suspected,  radiographs  can document  or rule out a fracture  \n[11,12] . \nCT Foot  \nIn this clinical  scenario  and in absence of exclusionary  criteria  for the Ottawa rules,  CT is not routinely used as \nthe first imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the foot. \nMRI Foot  \nMRI is not routinely  used as the first imaging study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the foot. \nUS Foot  \nA preliminary  ultrasound (US)  study  has had less successful  results compared  with radiographic  evaluation,  with \n90.9%  sensitivity  and specificity  for detecting  fracture  [13].

Initial  \nimaging typically  consists of a 3-view study  with the possibility  of additional  views as indicated  by the clinical  \nsetting  [8]. Additional  views,  such as axial  calcaneal  view,  can be useful  in patients  with suspected  calcaneal  \nfracture  [15] because addition of this view  increases specificity  in diagnosing calcaneal  fractures  and sensitivity  in \ndistinguishing intra-articular  calcaneal  fractures.  \nLisfranc  Injury  \nWhen  there is a fairly  high clinical  suspicion  of an acute Lisfranc injury,  the foot should be imaged.

Initial imaging.  \nMultiple  conditions  or scenarios preclude  the use of the Ottawa rules for determining  if imaging  is necessary  \n[5,6] . It has been  reported  that the Ottawa rules  for the foot should not be used or should be used with great  \ncaution  in the following  clinical  situations:  penetrating  trauma,  pregnancy,  any skin wound,  transferred  with \nradiographs  already  taken,  >10 days after trauma,  a return  visit for continued  traumatic  foot pain,  in the setting  of \npolytrauma,  altered  sensorium,  neurologic  abnormality  affecting  the foot, or underlying  bone  disease [7]. \nRadiograph y Foot  \nIf a foot fracture is suspected  in a neurologically  compromised  patient, including patients  with diabetic  \nneuropathy , the foot should  be radiographed.  The Ottawa rules  should  not be applied  in this clinical  setting  \nbecause pain perception  may be diminished,  no point  tenderness will be elicited  with palpation,  and the patient  \nmay be able to ambulate  even  if a fracture is present  [5]. Polytrauma  and penetrating  trauma  also constitute  \nexceptions  to the implementations  of the Ottawa rules . \nBoth  radiographs  and US are useful  imaging tools  to exclude  a foreign  body in the setting  of penetrating  trauma  to \nthe foot [24]. The best initial imaging study  for a foreign  body in the foot depends  on whether  or not the suspected  \nforeign  body is radiopaque  (eg, gravel,  both leaded  and nonleaded  glass,  or metal).  Radiographic  evaluation  for a \nradiopaque  foreign body has approximately  98% sensitivity  [25]. If an unembedded fragment  of the foreign  body \nis available,  then imaging  it alongside  the foot might  provide  more  information  as to the morphology and density  \nof the foreign  body.  \nCT Foot  \nCT is commonly used in evaluating  the true extent  of osseous injury  in complex fractures and at times  is used as \nthe initial imaging  study  in polytrauma  patients  and in complex  regions  such as the midfoot  [21,22] . In the \npolytrauma  patient, approximately  25% of midfoot  fractures identified  on CT are overlooked on radiographs  [21].  \nTherefore,  CT is essential  for appropriate  treatment  planning and determining  the true extent  of osseous injuries  in \nthe polytrauma  patient  and can be used as primary  imaging  technique  in high-energy  polytrauma  patients.  \nInitial clinical  experience suggests that cone -beam  CT of the foot or ankle  of pediatric  patients  is a viable  lower -\ndose alternative  to multidetector  CT [26]. \nMRI Foot  \nMRI is not routinely  used as the first imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the foot in the setting  of \nperipheral  neuropathy,  penetrating  trauma , or polytrauma .", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c4505633-566f-4477-a345-79a0977fdd77": {"__data__": {"id_": "c4505633-566f-4477-a345-79a0977fdd77", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "ACR acute trauma to foot.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "29141900-c8f2-4825-b78e-893ef410d832", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "ACR acute trauma to foot.pdf"}, "hash": "1a794ad6eeb7907232c202780b63b4a5581b9e49b9edcea673ba1e0b439351cf"}, "2": {"node_id": "3eb3e7ca-12b5-4b34-8e65-5d4922434aae", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "ACR acute trauma to foot.pdf"}, "hash": "595a1fdf51e56bcbb72fcd6044c8b8ecbfffaaab342506ee9bef4b76ce6a67f2"}}, "hash": "9a0171ca9607cbcea4baeedcefb5404d14dca37f85615d0da441b1bd346b1cf4", "text": "Initial clinical  experience suggests that cone -beam  CT of the foot or ankle  of pediatric  patients  is a viable  lower -\ndose alternative  to multidetector  CT [26]. \nMRI Foot  \nMRI is not routinely  used as the first imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the foot in the setting  of \nperipheral  neuropathy,  penetrating  trauma , or polytrauma . \nUS Foot  \nUS is not routinely  used as the first imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the foot in the setting  of \nperipheral  neuropathy or polytrauma.

If radiographs  \nare negative,  MRI can be obtained in select  patients  with forefoot  pain because of its increased  sensitivity  for the \nearly  detection  of metatarsal  head  subchondral  fracture  [54]. \nLisfranc  Injury  \nMRI has been  advocated  as a sensitive diagnostic  test in evaluation  of Lisfranc ligamentous  complex  (especially  \nif the patient  is not able to bear weight),  and 3-D volumetric  acquisitions  have  proven superiority  over orthogonal  \nproton  density  fat-suppressed  imaging [33,38,41- 45]. There is a high correlation  between  MRI and intraoperative  \nfindings  for an unstable  Lisfranc injury  [44].

Both  MRI and US have  been  shown  to be sensitive  for the diagnosis  of acute tendon  \nrupture  or dislocation  in the foot [39].

These  \nprocedures  are complementary  (ie, more  than one procedure  is ordered  as a set or simultaneously  in which  \neach procedure  provides  unique  clinical  information  to effectively  manage the patient\u2019s  care).  \n\u2022 Variant  3: Radiographs  of the foot are usually  appropriate  for the initial imaging of an adult  or child  older  \nthan 5 years of age with acute trauma  to the foot when  Ottawa rules cannot  be ruled  out due to exclusionary  \ncriteria.  CT of the foot without  IV contrast  may be appropriate  initial imaging  study  in high energy  \npolytrauma  patients.  \n\u2022 Variant  4: Radiographs  of the foot and radiographs  with weightbearing  of the foot are usually  appropriate  for \nthe initial imaging  of an adult  or child  older  than 5 years of age with acute trauma  to the foot when  Ottawa  \nrules can be evaluated  without  exclusionary  criteria  and are negative  or suspected  pathology  in an anatomic  \narea not addressed  by the Ottawa rules.  These procedures  are complementary  (ie, more  than one procedure  is \nordered  as a set or simultaneously  in which  each procedure  provides  unique  clinical  information  to effectively  \nmanage the patient\u2019s  care).  The panel  did not agree on recommending CT of the foot without IV contrast  for \nthe initial imaging  of patients in this clinical scenario.  There is insufficient  medical  literature  to conclude  \nwhether  or not these patients  would benefit  from  CT of the foot without  IV contrast.  CT of the foot without  \nIV contrast  in this patient  population  is controversial  but can be appropriate.  \n\u2022 Variant  5: CT of the foot without  IV contrast  or MRI of the foot without  IV contrast  is usually  appropriate  \nfor the next imaging  study  when  radiographs  are normal  or equivocal  of an adult  or child  older  than 5 years of \nage with acute trauma  to the foot and suspected  Lisfranc injury, tendon injury, or occult  fracture  or \ndislocation.

The most  common  acute knee  injuries  result  from  \na direct  blow,  a fall, or a twisting  injury  [2,3] . The fracture  risk increases  with age, likely  secondary  to decreased  \nbone  mineral  density,  increased  frequency  of blunt  injury, and inability  to protect  the knee  during a fall [3]. An \nestimated  6.6 million  knee  injuries  presented  to emergency  departments in the United  States  from  1999 through  \n2008,  for a rate of 2.29 knee  injuries  per 1,000 population . Prompt  and accurate diagnosis  facilitates  adequate  \nmanagement  and may prevent  potential complications  [1,4] .  \nAfter  thorough history  and clinical  exam ination , radiographs  are usually  the initial imaging  modality  in the \nevaluation  of the acutely  injured  knee  [1]. Adequate clinical  exam ination  and appropriate  application  of the \nestablished  decision -making rules can reduce the number  of radiographic  studies in the setting of acute knee  injuries  \nwith a potential  benefit  of reducing health  care costs and decreasing  radiation  exposure  to the patient  [1,5,6] . \nTreatment  options  for acute traumatic  knee injuries  depend  on the severity  of injury  and patient  factors and include  \nconservative or surgical  management  [1]. \nSpecial Imaging  Considerations  \nFor the purpose  of this document,  point -of-care ultrasound  (US)  is not discussed  or listed  in the variant  tables.  \nFor the purposes  of distinguishing  between  CT and CT angiography  (CTA),  ACR  Appropriateness Criteria  topics  \nuse the definition  in the ACR -NASCI -SIR-SPR  Practice Parameter  for the Performance and Interpretation  of Body  \nComputed Tomography  Angiography (CTA)  [7].  \n\u201cCTA uses a thin-section  CT acquisition  that is timed  to coincide  with peak  arterial  or venous \nenhancement.  The resultant  volumetric dataset  is interpreted  using  primary transverse  \nreconstructions as well as multiplanar  reformations and 3-D renderings.\u201d  \nAll elements  are essential:  1) timing, 2) reconstructions/reformats,  and 3) 3-D renderings.  Standard  CTs with \ncontrast  also include  timing  issues and recons/reformats.

Initial imaging.  \nCT Knee  \nIn the absence of focal  tenderness and joint effusion  in a patient  who is able to walk,  CT is not used as the initial  \nimaging study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the knee.  \nMR Arthrography  Knee  \nMR arthrography  is not routinely  used as the initial imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the knee.  \nMRA Knee  \nMR angiography  (MRA ) is not routinely used as the initial imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the \nknee.  \nMRI Knee  \nMRI is not routinely  used as the initial imaging study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the knee.  \nRadiography Knee  \nWith no clinical  symptoms  in the injured  knee , including lack of focal  tenderness and joint effusion , and with ability  \nto walk,  knee  radiographs  may be indicated  if a patient  >55 years old per Ottawa rules or >50 years old or <12 years \nold per Pittsburgh  rule criteria [5, 6, 10]. If the patient  is between  5 and 12 years,  they fall outside  the age range  for \nboth the Ottawa and Pittsburgh  rules and radiographs  may be beneficial  despite lack of clinical  symptoms.  \nRadiographs  are commonly  performed  in the setting  of acute knee  injuries  but have  a low yield  for showing  \nfractures.  In a retrospective review of 1,967 patients  with acute knee  injuries  by Stiell et al [2], 74.1%  of patients  \nhad knee  radiography,  and only 5.2%  of these had fractures.  Therefore,  to avoid a large  number  of negative  \nradiographic  studies,  development  of the inclusion  criteria for obtaining knee  radiographs  in the setting  of the acute  \ntrauma  was needed.  \nThe two most  commonly used clinical  decision  criteria , the Ottawa Knee Rule  and the Pittsburgh  Decision  Rule,  \ncan help to decide  when  to perform  radiographs  in acute knee  trauma  [5,6,8] . \nOttawa  Knee Rule  \nThe Ottawa Knee Rule  [5,6,8]  states that patients  \u226518 years of age with acute knee  pain should have  knee  \nradiographs  if they meet  any of the following  criteria:  \n\u2022 Are 55 years of age or older,  \n\u2022 Have palpable  tenderness over the head  of the fibula, \n\u2022 Have isolated  patellar  tenderness,  \n\u2022 Cannot  flex the knee  to 90\u00b0, \n\u2022 Cannot  bear weight  immediately  following  the injury,  or \n\u2022 Cannot  walk  in the emergency  room  (after  taking  4 steps).  \nPittsburg h Decision  Rule  \nThe Pittsburgh  Decision  Rule  states that patients  with acute knee  trauma  who are <12 years old or >50 years old \nshould have  radiographs  as well as patients  who cannot  take 4 weight -bearing  steps in the emergency  department  \n[5,6] . \nIn their prospective study  in 178 patients with acute knee  trauma  with the Ottawa rule criteria applied,  Jenny  et al \n[8] found a 35% decrease in the number  of radiographic  examinations  with 100%  sensitivity  for detecting  knee  \nfracture.  Similarly, Cheung  et al [6] found a 23% reduction of knee  radiographs  in 90 patients if the Ottawa rule \ncriteria  were applied,  although they did report  1 patient who had a fracture  and did not meet  any of the clinical  \ncriteria , but this fracture  was radiographically  occult  and visible  only by MRI.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8d04a745-9e63-4a82-a9e0-04b16cf81f6d": {"__data__": {"id_": "8d04a745-9e63-4a82-a9e0-04b16cf81f6d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "ACR acute trauma to knee.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8da11d1e-9349-44fc-8bea-699001358693", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "ACR acute trauma to knee.pdf"}, "hash": "dee097e7589a0e4675f97bc89f767ed12a0d4749cc42bfe94cbaceeacc7a7505"}, "2": {"node_id": "00c866d0-4fa6-4506-9636-3bc2dcbc4314", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "ACR acute trauma to knee.pdf"}, "hash": "a8601ed3a43ce26126f4ab3d98c23e7b36f785582ffcbf151134749662281117"}}, "hash": "67537c6d4b4afaf1e12eee6d696d4e5c089c5c6b1264f410b92a49308848cac6", "text": "Similarly, Cheung  et al [6] found a 23% reduction of knee  radiographs  in 90 patients if the Ottawa rule \ncriteria  were applied,  although they did report  1 patient who had a fracture  and did not meet  any of the clinical  \ncriteria , but this fracture  was radiographically  occult  and visible  only by MRI.  \nIn their retrospective study  on 106 acute knee  trauma  patients,  Konan  et al [5] evaluated  the role of the Ottawa and \nPittsburgh  rules  to reduce the unnecessary  use of radiographs  followin g knee  injury.

Using  the Pittsburgh  rules,  32 radiographic  studies (30%)  could have  been  \navoided.  In this study,  both the Ottawa and Pittsburgh  rules showed  high sensitivity  in detecting  knee  fractures [5]. \nOther  clinical  decision  criteria  were tested.  In an emergency  department,  in a study  of 242 patients >17 years  with \nisolated  knee  injuries  sustained  24 hours  previously,  Web er et al [3] were able to exclude  clinically  significant  \nfractures in patients  >18 years who could walk  without  limping  or if there was a twisting  injury  to the knee  and no \njoint effusion.  These clinical decision  rules were effective in detecting  knee  fractures with 100%  sensitivity  and \nwith sufficient  specificity  to eliminate  29% of knee  radiographs  [3]. \nIn their prospective study  of 146 patients  3 to 18 years of age with acute trauma  to the knee,  Moore  et al [9] evaluated  \nthree criteria  including:  1) inability  to bear weight, 2) inability  to flex the knee  to 90\u00b0, and 3) presence of bony \ntenderness.  They  found  a potential 53% reduction in radiographs  if applying  only the criteria  of ability  to take 4 \nweight -bearing  steps in the emergency  department.  Three of their patients  negative  for criterion  3 were found to \nhave  fractures.  \nIt is general  agreement  that radiographs  should  be obtained  and the clinical  decision  rule should not be applied  for \npatients  with gross  deformity  [3], a palpable  mass  [10], a penetrating  injury,  prosthetic  hardware,  an unreliable  \nclinical  history  or physical  examination  secondary  to multiple  injuries  [3,10] , altered  mental  status (eg, head  injury,  \ndrug or alcohol  use, dementia)  [3,10] , neuropathy (eg, paraplegia,  diabetes)  [3,10] , or a history  suggesting  increased  \nrisk of fracture.  However,  in any case scenario,  the physician\u2019s judgment  and common  sense should supersede  \nclinical  guidelines  [3]. \nFor evaluation  of the acutely  injured knee  in patients  meeting  Ottawa or Pittsburgh  rule criteria, a minimum  of 2 \nradiographs  (anteroposterior  and lateral)  of the affected  knee  should be obtained . The lateral  view is obtained with \nthe knee  at 25\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 of flexion  in the lateral  decubitus  position  and should demonstrate  the patella  in profile.  It \nallows the evaluation  for the presence of joint effusion.  A cross-table  lateral  view  with a horizontal  beam  enables \nvisualization  of lipohemarthrosis,  frequently  seen with intra-articular  fractures [11].  Additional commonly \nperformed  supplemental  imaging  projections  in the acute knee  trauma  setting  include  patellofemoral, internal  \noblique , and external  oblique  views.  The patellofemoral  view is typically  obtained  in suspected  patellar  fractures  \nand/or subluxation or dislocation  [1]. \nBone  Scan  with  SPECT  or SPECT/CT  Knee  \nTc-99m  bone  scan with single -photon emission  computed  tomography  (SPECT)/CT  knee is not routinely  used as \nthe initial imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the knee.  \nUS Knee  \nUS is not routinely  used as the initial imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the knee.  \nVariant  2: Adult  or child  5 years of age or older .

A \ncomparison  of US studies with radiography  and CT examination s by Bonnefoy  et al [40] serving  as the reference  \nstandard  and using a knee  lipohemarthrosis  as a criterion , yielded  a sensitivity  of and specificity  of 94% for US \ndetection  of acute intra-articular  fractures.

Beaman, MD.q \nSummary  of Literature  Review  \nIntroduction/Background  \nThe terms  \u201cbone  tumor\u201d and \u201csoft tissue  tumor\u201d have  broad  definitions.  Many  of these  tumors  do not conform  to a \nbinary  benign  or malignant  assignment.  The World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  classifies  bone  and soft tissue  \ntumors  into benign,  intermediate  locally  aggressive,  intermediate  locally  aggressive  rarely  metastasizing,  and \nmalignant  categories  [1]. For this reason,  this document  pertains  to both malignant  tumors  and those  intermediate  \nor \u201caggressive\u201d tumors  of bone  and soft tissue  origin.  Malignant  and aggressive  primary  bone  and soft tissue  tumors  \nof musculoskeletal  origin  are rare. In 2020,  soft tissue  tumors  represented  0.7%  and bone/joint  tumors  0.2%  of all \nnew cancer  cases  in the United  States  [2,3] . The WHO  recognizes  more  than 50 histologic  subtypes  of soft tissue  \ntumors  and over 30 subtypes  of bone  tumors.  Many  publications  addressing  staging  and surveillance  of these  tumors  \nare statistically  underpowered  given  the rarity  of bone  and soft tissue  tumors.  Additionally,  much  of the literature  \nis historic  and outcomes  have changed  with more  recent  therapeutic  and imaging  advances.  Most  of these  tumors  \nare referred  to and treated  at tertiary  medical  centers,  where the available  medical  evidence  is supplemented  by \nclinical  experience  and expert  opinion  to formulate  a treatment  plan.  The authors  have  attempted  to consolidate  this \ndiverse  group  of tumors  as much  as possible  to simplify  the application  of these  recommendations.  Variation  in \napplying  these  recommendations  is expected  and encouraged  on an individual  basis  with particular  attention  to \ntumor  histology  and grading.  \nThis document  is specific  to malignant  or aggressive  primary  tumors  of bone  or soft tissue  origin.  This document  \nspecifically  does not pertain  to 1) metastatic  disease  to bone  or soft tissues,  2) primary  tumors  of spine  or neuroaxis  \norigin,  3) primary  tumors  of head  or neck  origin,  4) intraabdominal  or retroperitoneal  tumors,  5) primary  tumors  of \nskin origin,  and 6) plasma  cell or other  hematologic  disorders  that involve  bone  (ie, multiple  myeloma).  The variants  \nin this document  assume  a diagnosis  of a primary  malignant  or aggressive  bone  or soft tissue  tumor  has already  \nbeen  established.

This document  does not address  the evaluation  of chemotherapy  or radiation  therapy  effectiveness  \nor issues  of cost-effectiveness  and radiation  dose.  \nSpecial  Imaging  Considerations  \nHardware  reconstruction  is often  needed  following  limb-sparing  surgery  for the management  of bone  tumors  and \noccasionally  for soft tissue  tumors.  This hardware  creates  artifact  and limits  evaluation  of the adjacent  structures  \nwith traditional  CT, PET/CT , and MRI  sequences  and techniques.  Although  metal  artifact  can negatively  impact  \nCT, PET/CT , and/or  MRI  image  quality,  this document  assumes  metal  artifact  can be minimized  with current  metal  \nartifact  reduction  protocols.  There  may still be instances  where  metal  artifact  cannot  be sufficiently  suppressed,  and \nCT, PET/CT , and/or  MRI  become  of limited  benefit . In these  cases,  deviations  from  the variant  recommendations  \nmay be necessary  and should  be informed  by the clinical  experience  and expertise  of the treatment  team.  \n \naResearch Author, Mayo Clinic Florida, Jacksonville, Florida. bDiagnostic  Imaging Associates, Chesterfield, Missouri. cPanel Chair, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, \nFlorida. dPanel Vice -Chair, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston Salem, North Carolina. eThe Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, \nBaltimore, Marylan d. fMallinckrodt Institute of Radiology Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri. gNova Southeastern University, \nFort Lauderdale, Florida. hMoffitt Cancer Center and University of South Florida Morsani College of Medicine, Tampa, Flo rida; MSK -RADS (Bone) \nCommittee. iMayo Clinic Florida, Jacksonville, Florida. jStritch School of Medicine Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, Illinois; Commission on Radiation \nOncology. kUniversity of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, Texas; American A cademy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. lBrigham & Women's Hospital & \nHarvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts; American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeon s. mMayo Clinic Florida, \nJacksonville, Florida, Primary care physicia n. nUniversity of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia. oSUNY Downstate Health Sciences University, Brooklyn, \nNew York. pMayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida; Commission on Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging. qSpecialty Chair, University of Kentucky, \nLexington, Kentucky.  \n The American  College  of Radiology  seeks  and encourages  collaboration  with other  organizations  on the development  of the ACR  Appropriateness  \nCriteria  through  representation  of such organizations  on expert  panels.

Initial  staging.  Evaluation  for \npulmonary  metastasis.  \nApproximately  20% of patients  with primary  extremity  sarcomas  will have or develop  distant  metastatic  disease.  \nPulmonary  metastases  account  for approximately  75% of all sarcoma  metastases,  with variations  of incidence  \ndepending  on tumor  histology  and grade  [4,5] . Metastatic  disease  decreases  survival,  with pulmonary  metastases  as \nthe primary  cause  of death  in patients  with osteosarcoma  [6,7] . Metastasectomy  improves  survival,  and thermal  \nablation  and radiation  therapy  are emerging  as promising  alternative  treatment  options  [8-10]. Therefore,  evaluation  \nfor pulmonary  metastases  is an essential  part of primary  musculoskeletal  tumor  initial  staging.  \nCT Chest  With  IV Contrast  \nThere  is no relevant  literature  regarding  the specific  use of CT chest  with intravenous  (IV) contrast  in the evaluation  \nof pulmonary  metastasis  from  malignant  or aggressive  primary  musculoskeletal  tumors.  However,  IV contrast  may \nlead to equivocal  assessment  of mineralization,  which  can be a useful  morphologic  feature  to distinguish  benign  \nversus  malignant  pulmon ary nodules.  Therefore,  CT chest  with IV contrast  is not generally  useful  as the sole \nimaging  technique,  and there  is felt to be little additional  benefit  in the CT assessment  of pulmonary  nodules  without  \nand with IV contrast  compared  with CT chest  without  IV contrast  in this setting.  \nCT Chest  Without  and With  IV Contrast  \nThere  is no relevant  literature  regarding  the specific  use of CT chest  without  and with IV contrast  in the evaluation  \nof pulmonary  metastasis  from  malignant  or aggressive  primary  musculoskeletal  tumors.  However,  IV contrast  may \nlead to equivocal  assessment  of mineralization,  which  can be a useful  morphologic  feature  to distinguish  benign  \nversus  malignant  pulmonary  nodules.

However,  studies  have  shown  that \neven  CT underestimates  the number  of pulmonary  metastases  compared  with lung palpation  during  thoracotomy.  \nSpecific  to osteosarcoma  pulmonary  metastases,  CT missed  approximately  10% of palpable  lung lesions,  of which  \nnearly  half were  confirmed  metastases  in a series  of 118 patients  with osteosarcoma  [9]. A smaller  series  of 28 \npatients  with osteosarc oma also showed  that CT missed  26% of viable  metastases  compared  with palpation  [11]. \nHowever,  as CT technology  improves  and slice thickness  decreases,  more  and smaller  pulmonary  nodules  can be \nidentified  resulting  in the dilemma  of increased  false -positive  rates.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "321439a7-62c4-467b-b019-7922d88c2266": {"__data__": {"id_": "321439a7-62c4-467b-b019-7922d88c2266", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "ACR aggressive primary msk tumour staging and surveillance.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "386067c9-d721-455a-a053-82eec60fd5f3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "ACR aggressive primary msk tumour staging and surveillance.pdf"}, "hash": "5c15666be8881345fc3f172ef1348433a5f6a0bccc9ea93ce755a8222811343b"}, "2": {"node_id": "6082f8a7-1130-4ca4-bb4a-1103c41be93a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "ACR aggressive primary msk tumour staging and surveillance.pdf"}, "hash": "dc98ce9218a49ce5f5f4da8fea154e0f63d7f1b9df33fb021befb072c2badd37"}}, "hash": "c8cfbfb1313b85419593799478e7cbbcc63ce063675fa82e67ccce20e9a881d0", "text": "A smaller  series  of 28 \npatients  with osteosarc oma also showed  that CT missed  26% of viable  metastases  compared  with palpation  [11]. \nHowever,  as CT technology  improves  and slice thickness  decreases,  more  and smaller  pulmonary  nodules  can be \nidentified  resulting  in the dilemma  of increased  false -positive  rates.  A study  of 283 lung nodules  in patients  with \nosteosarcoma  found  a statistically  significant  cutoff  of 6 mm to differentiate  benign  and malignant  pulmonary  \nnodules  (specificity  89.8%)  [9]. A study  of 311 subcentimeter  pulmonary  nodules  in 195 patients  with soft tissue  \nsarcoma  found  combining  morphologic  criteria , in addition  to size criteria , helped  differentiate  benign  and \nmalignant  pulmonary  nodules,  with round  solid  nodules  >5 mm more  likely  to be malignant  (76%  P = .002)  and \ncomplex  ground -glass  nodules  <5 mm more  likely  to be benign  (84%,  P < .0001)  [12]. Given  the survival  benefit  \nof treating  pulmonary  metastases,  if pulmonary  nodules  are identified  on any other  modality  in patients  with primary  \nmusculoskeletal  sarcoma,  CT chest  is then often  indicated  for biopsy  and/or  pretreatment  planning.  \nFDG -PET/CT  Whole  Body  \nA meta -analysis  of FDG -PET/CT  for the staging  of patients  with osteosarcoma  demonstrated  81% combined  \nsensitivity  and 94% specificity  for detection  of lung metastases  [6].

Comparison  studies  between  PET imaging  alone  versus  CT acquired  during  FDG -\nPET/CT  have  been  reported,  although  the CT acquired  for attenuation  correction  and anatomic  registration  is not \nregarded  as equivalent  to dedicated  diagnostic  CT chest  imaging  [13].

Evaluation  of subcentimeter  pulmonary  \nnodules  is a known  limitation  of FDG -PET/CT  because  of the inherent  resolution  constraints  of PET/CT  technology  \nand respiratory  motion  artifact.

The \ninherent  decreased  spatial  resolution  of MRI  compared  to CT raises  doubts  about  the ability  to identify  small  \npulmonary  metastases  with FDG -PET/MRI  as accurately  as CT.

Therefore,  guidance  regarding  modality  for lung screening  often  differ  between  \nlow-risk and high-risk patients.  There  is also debate  concerning  the frequency  of lung surveillance.  Given  most  \npulmonary  metastases  will occur  within  2 years  of primary  resection  [47], many  experts  support  more  frequent  \nsurveillance  initially  in the first few years  after diagnosis.  Surveillance  regimens  usually  de-escalate  to annual  \nfollow -up after 5 years  postresection  [48-52]. Although  these dynamic  protocols  are often  used,  a prospective  \nrandomized  trial of 500 patients  with resected  extremity  sarcomas  and no baseline  metastatic  disease  found  no \ndifference  in overall  survival  or recurrence -free survival  between  groups  whether  surveilled  at 3 month  or 6-month  \nconsistent  intervals  [53,54] . Pulmonary  metastases  are associated  with a worse  prognosis  [45], and treatment  of \nthese  pulmonary  metastases  can improve  survival  [8,10] . Identification  of pulmonary  metastases  is an essential  part \nof primary  musculoskeletal  tumor  screening.

CT imaging  for lung \nmetastases  has been  criticized  by some  as being  too sensitive.  Several  studies  have  attempted  to find size and \nmorphologic  criteria  to help discriminate  between  malignant  and benign  pulmonary  nodules  [9,12] . Rissing  et al \n[55] showed  that those  only with pulmonary  lesions  <5 mm were  associated  with equivalent  survival  to those  with \nnormal  scans.  Often  when  a pulmonary  metastasis  is identified  on a different  imaging  modality,  CT is then required  \nfor biopsy  or treatment  planning.  \nGuidance  varies regarding  whether  to use CT chest  versus  chest  radiography  as surveillance  for lung metastases  in \npatients  with sarcoma.  Much  of the debate  also takes  cost-analysis  and radiation  exposure  into consideration.  A \nretrospective  study  by Cho et al [56] of 176 patients  with stage  II or stage  III high-grade  extremity  sarcomas  \ncalculated  similar  5-year survival  rates  whether  surveilled  with chest  radiography  or CT chest.  However,  when  \nstratifying  survival  rates  by stage,  they found  a survival  benefit  for stage  III patients  when  monitored  with CT chest  \nlikely  related  to the increased  rates  of lung metastasis  with high-grade  sarcoma .

A large  multicenter  retrospective  study  by Gamboa  et al [45] comparing  lung surveillance  in 909 \npatients  with extremity,  truncal,  or retroperitoneal  high-grade  soft tissue  sarcomas  found  the 5-year survival  rate \nwas noninferior  for patients  followed  with chest  radiography  versus  CT chest  (71%  versus  60%).

Of the false -negative  FDG -PET/CT  results  in that study,  half were  pulmonary  nodules  <10 mm [15]. \nEvaluation  of subcentimeter  pulmonary  nodules  is a known  limitat ion of FDG -PET/CT  because  of the inherent  \nresolution  constraints  of PET/CT  technology  and respiratory  motion  artifact.

MRI of the lungs  relies  heavily  on the ability  to minimize  respiratory  motion.  \nRadiography  Chest  \nChest  radiography  is less sensitive  than CT chest  imaging  for the detection  of pulmonary  nodules.  Whooley  et al \n[57] found  that 83% of asymptomatic  metastases  were  detected  radiographically  with a positive  predictive  value  of \n92% and a negative  predictive  value  of 97%.  However,  the detection  of more  and smaller  pulmonary  metastases  \nwith CT versus  radiography  has definitely  not improved  survival  rates.  Although  radiography  is less sensitive  for \ndetection  of lung metastases,  how that correlates  with clinically  significant  metastases  is less certain.  \nVariant  4: Malignant  or aggressive  primary  bone  tumor.

Local  recurrence  rates  of bone  sarcomas  are reported  to be approximately  10% to 15% \nin patients  with osteosarcoma  and Ewing  sarcoma  [58-61]. Prognosis  is poor for locally  recurrent  malignant  or \naggressive  bone  tumors,  with postrecurrence  5-year survival  rates  reported  approximately  15% to 30% in patients  \nwith osteosarcoma  and 5% in patients  with Ewing  sarcoma  [60,62] . Factors  associated  with poorer  prognosis  in \npatients  with osteosarcoma  were  size of local  recurrence  (>5 cm) and presence  of distant  metastasis  [60]. \nRecommendations  for local  recurrence  surveillance  imaging  vary amongst  expert  guidelines,  although  all \nacknowledge  the benefit  of clinical  evaluation.  Locally  recurrent  bone  tumors  can often  present  as a soft tissue  \nmass,  and in a study  of osteosarcoma  local  recurrences,  the majority  (approximately  75%)  were  soft tissue  masses  \nrather  than bone  lesions  [60]. Some  guidelines  recommend  clinical  exam ination  to be performed  solely , whereas  \nothers  recommend  in combination  with imaging  [49,51,52,63] . Time  to recurrence  also varies  with tumor  histology.  \nMost  osteosarcoma  local  recurrences  have  been  shown  to occur  within  5 years  of resection.  However,  late \nrecurrence  of both osteosarcoma  and Ewing  sarcoma  have  been  reported  [60,61] .

When  hardware  is present,  even  with modern  metal -artifact  reduction  techniques,  radiography  can \nvisualize  the bone -metal  or bone -cement  interface , which  can be critical  to evaluate  for tumor  recurrence.  \nRadiographs  are recommended  for the surveillance  of local  recurrence  of malignant  or aggressive  primary  bone  \ntumors.  \nUS Area  of Interest  \nUS is not useful  for evaluating  bone  lesions  when  there  is no extraosseous  tumor  extension.  However,  US may be \nbeneficial  if a mass  is identified  clinically.  There  is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of US as surveillance  \nfor asymptomatic  local  recurrence  of malignant  or aggressive  primary  bone  tumors.  \nVariant  5: Malignant  or aggressive  primary  soft tissue  tumor.  Surveillance  for local  recurrence.  \nThe body regions covered in this clinical scenario are abdomen, ankle, chest, elbow,  shoulder , thigh, foot, forearm, \nhand, arm, knee, pelvis, leg, and wrist.  \nLocal  recurrence  rates  of soft tissue  sarcomas  have  been  reported  to occur  at rates  of 5% to 25% in larger  historic  \nstudies  [69-72]. Although  rates  of local  recurrence  following  primary  resection  depend  on tumor  histology  and \ngrade,  several  other  factors  have  been  identified  that increase  risk. Tumor  location  is associated  with local  \nrecurrence,  with those  tumors  located  deep  to fascia  or in the upper  extremities/trunk  as more  likely  to recur  [73]. \nPositive  or close  resection  margins  have  also been associated  with increased  likelihood  of local  recurrence  \n[70,73,74] . Local  recurrence  is associated  with metastatic  disease  and increased  mortality  [70], and if the recurrence  \ncan be treated  before  developing  metastatic  disease  there  is a survival  benefit  [73]. Size of the recurrence  has also \nbeen  linked  with not only survival  [75] but also morbidity,  because  larger  tumors  often  require  more  extensive  \nsurgery  [48]. Therefore,  survei llance  for local  recurrence  is important  to reduce  both mortality  and morbidity.  \nThere  remains  some  controversy  not only on how to surveil  resected  soft tissue  sarcomas  but also if imaging  \nsurveillance  is even  necessary.  The primary  dispute  against  the need  for imaging  surveillance  is the argument  that \nrecurrences  are usually  clinically  detectable  [54,76] . The literature  also has some  conflicting  evidence  on this topic.  \nFor example,  a prospective  study  of 500 patients  with sarcoma  found  90% of local  recurrences  were  clinically  \ndetected  [54]. Conversely,  a large  recent  study  of 325 patients  with soft tissue  sarcomas  found  a rate of 60% of the \nlocal  recurrences  were  not detected  clinically  [77]. Expert  guidelines  vary on recommendations  for local  recurrence  \nimaging , although  all acknowledge  the benefit  of clinical  evaluation;  some  guidelines  recommend  clinical  \nexamination  to be performed  solely , whereas  others  recommend  in combination  with imaging  [49,5 1,52,63] . \nClinical  evaluation  of deep  soft tissue  local  recurrence  remains  a limitation  of this approach.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "22f6be73-6327-44c2-8662-aca4612228a2": {"__data__": {"id_": "22f6be73-6327-44c2-8662-aca4612228a2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "ACR aggressive primary msk tumour staging and surveillance.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "68daff53-aa93-424d-b037-101fd804274e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "ACR aggressive primary msk tumour staging and surveillance.pdf"}, "hash": "46964ddfab250bb2caadd097e42ec7743f950584076c6b5b06c00dc91e77a877"}, "2": {"node_id": "2cb57e17-5e8d-4234-8309-343802b4c075", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "ACR aggressive primary msk tumour staging and surveillance.pdf"}, "hash": "6c0e384d4db714220ab6d5feff6b4f1ffe5947610c75ee78b8f21a7df9991a26"}}, "hash": "531b23e012ec6f04ae357775795d0279cea2525de03d6add3c7e84513457ec0f", "text": "Expert  guidelines  vary on recommendations  for local  recurrence  \nimaging , although  all acknowledge  the benefit  of clinical  evaluation;  some  guidelines  recommend  clinical  \nexamination  to be performed  solely , whereas  others  recommend  in combination  with imaging  [49,5 1,52,63] . \nClinical  evaluation  of deep  soft tissue  local  recurrence  remains  a limitation  of this approach.

In 2010,  16.3 \nmillion  health  care visits  to hospitals  and physician  offices were related  primarily  to neck  pain [1]. The Global  \nBurden  of Disease 2010 Study  identified  neck  pain as the fourth  leading  cause of years lost to disability [2], with \nmost  epidemiological  studies reporting an annual  prevalence ranging between  15% and 50% [3-8]. Although  most  \nepisodes resolve,  nearly  50% of individuals  continue  to experience ongoing or recurrent  pain [9]. \nThe differential  diagnosis  of cervical  or neck  pain includes  consideration  of acute versus chronic,  neuropathic  \nversus nonneuropathic  [10],  and musculoskeletal  versus nonmusculoskeletal  processes.  It is important  to \nacknowledge  overlap  of symptoms  of cervical  or neck  pain,  and cervical  radiculopathy with additional conditions  \nand symptoms  beyond the scope of this document.  Imaging in the setting  of spine  trauma  should be guided  by the \nACR  Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae topic on \u201cSuspected  Spine  Trauma \u201d [11]. The presence  of a neck  mass  or \nlymphadenopathy should  be guided by the ACR  Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae topic on \u201cNeck  Mass/Adenopathy \u201d \n[12]. Neuropathic symptoms  should be clarified  by exam ination  to exclude  myelopathy or plexopathy,  guided by \nthe ACR  Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae topic on \u201cMyelopathy\u201d  [13] and ACR  Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae topic on \n\u201cPlexopathy\u201d  [14], respectively.  Evaluation  of cervicogenic  headache may overlap  with symptoms  addressed  in \nthe ACR  Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae topic on \u201cHeadache\u201d  [15]. The presence of clinical signs  or symptoms  \nsuggesting meningitis, neck  soft-tissue infection, or upper  respiratory  infection  should be managed  on clinical  \nguidelines  separate from  this review of cervical  neck  pain.  \nMechanical  pain associated  with facet  joints, intervertebral  discs,  muscles,  or fascia represents the majority  of \nnontraumatic  cervical  or neck  pain,  with the acknowledgement  that these may result  from  or accelerate in the \nsetting  of prior  traumatic  injury.

Cervical  neuropathic  pain most  commonly includes  radicular  symptoms  from  a \nherniated  disc or osteophyte.

Factors associated with poo r prognosis include female gender, older age, coexisting psychosocial \npathology, and radicular symptoms [ 1], although the causation versus association o f these relationships is not \ndefined.  \nIn absence of red flag symptoms, imaging may not be required at the time of initial presentation [ 1] as spondylotic  \nchanges are commonly identified on radiographs and MRI in patients >30 years of age  and correlate poorly with \nthe presence of neck pain [20-23]. Although the diagnostic accuracy of red flag symptoms is not validated for the \ncervical spine, the Bone  and Joint  Decade 2000 -2010 Task Force on Neck Pain and Its Associated Disorders [1] \nrecommended the adoption of a similar system for cervical and neck pain, with red flags including trauma, \nmalignancy, prior neck surgery, spinal cord injury, systemic diseases \u2014including ankylosing spondylitis, diffuse \nidiopathic skeletal hyperostos is, inflammatory arthritis \u2014suspected infection, history of intravenous drug use, \nintractable pain despite therapy , or tenderness to palpation over a vertebral body. Additional proposed red flags \ninclude congenital findings, concomitant vascular disease in patients >50 years of age, abnormal labs (erythrocyte \nsedimentation rate, C -reactive protein level, white blood cell), and neurological deficits [10].  \nCT Cervical Spine  \nCT offers superior depiction of cortical bone and is more sensitive than radiographs in assessing facet \ndegenerative disease, osteophyte formation, vacuum phenomenon, and joint capsular calcification [24].

Cervical  radiculopathy is less prevalent  than cervical  or neck  pain, with one  \npopulation-based  study showing an average annual  age-adjusted  incidence of 83.2 per 100,000 people  [31].  \nRadiculopathies  may result  from  compressive causes  related to narrowing of the neural foramina, such as by facet \nor uncovertebral joint hypertrophy, or from associated dis c bulging or herniation  and degenerative spondylosis  in \nthe absence of a history  of diabetes or red flag symptom s [31].  A recent meta-analysis assessing the positive \npredictive value of physical examination tests in the setting of a clinical history of cervical radiculopathy \nconcluded there was limited evidence for a correlation between physical examination findings and MRI evidence \nof cervical nerve root compression [32].  This may be due to a high rate of both false -positive and false-negative \nfindings on MRI in the setting of suspected cervical radiculopathy [33 ]. Most cases of acute cervical neck pain \nwith radicular symptoms resolve spontaneously or with conse rvative treatment measures [31, 34]. \nIn absence of red flag symptoms, imaging may not be required at time of initial presentation [1 ] as spondylotic \nchanges are commonly identified on radi ographs and MRI in patients >30 years of age and correlate poorly with \nthe presence of neck pain [20-23]. Although the diagnostic accuracy of red flag symptoms is not validated for the \ncervical spine, the Bone  and Joint  Decade 2000 -2010 Task Force on Neck Pain and Its Associated Disorders [1] \nrecommended the adoption of a similar system for cervical and neck pain, with red flags that include  trauma, \nmalignancy, prior neck surgery, spinal cord injury, systemic diseases \u2014inclu ding ankylosing spondylitis, diffuse \nidiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, inflammatory arthritis, suspected infection \u2014history of intravenous drug use, \nintractable pain despite therapy, or tenderness to palpation over a vertebral body. Additional proposed red flags include congenital findings, concomitant vascular disease in patients >50 years of age, abnormal labs (erythrocyte \nsedimentation rate, C -reactive protein level, white blood cell), and neurological deficits [10\n].", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "69d3d40d-715a-4357-ac58-43789f6ca0c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "69d3d40d-715a-4357-ac58-43789f6ca0c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "ACR cervical neck pain radiculopathy.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a32bbf53-106a-4968-85a1-38e3096c1c01", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "ACR cervical neck pain radiculopathy.pdf"}, "hash": "2c8a5f5194618407b4830539bba49237f650294c158ed12832202e106bb00699"}, "2": {"node_id": "1817eb97-52b7-4ace-9ae3-155625215647", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "ACR cervical neck pain radiculopathy.pdf"}, "hash": "5da92b07fd206d41c5fb3b1acc89fb262c35ed58d1f36d38f933a983375f0f6f"}}, "hash": "0ecc7084df7c5e2523e96db9fae2d47794b3e18f4a8b91f9f2e5188480f4ab10", "text": "Additional proposed red flags include congenital findings, concomitant vascular disease in patients >50 years of age, abnormal labs (erythrocyte \nsedimentation rate, C -reactive protein level, white blood cell), and neurological deficits [10\n]. \nCT Cervical Spine  \nCT provides good definition of bony elements and is helpful in the assessment of neuroforaminal stenosis \nsecondary to uncovertebral or facet hypertrophy and is helpful when C6 and C7 are not clearly seen on traditional \nlateral radiographic views.

Brown et al \n[35] in a blinded, retrospective review studied 34 patients with clinically diagnosed cervical radiculopathy  who \nunderwent MRI prior to surger y and reported that MRI correctly predicted 88% of the lesions as opposed to 81% \nfor CT myelography, 57% for plain myelography, and 50% for CT. However, as noted previously, degenerative \nfindings on MRI are commonly observed in asymptomatic patients [21, 23,40,41]. A prospective study evaluating \nMRI cervical spine in recent onset cervical radiculopathy found a high rate of both false-positive and false-\nnegative findings [33].  \nBone Scan Whole Body with SPECT or SPECT/CT Neck  \nTc-99m bone scan lacks both resolution and specificity to detect pathology related to suspected nerve root \ncompression.  \nRadiography Cervical Spine  \nApproximately 65% of asymptomatic patients  50 to 59 years of age will have  radiographic  evidence of significant  \ncervical  spine  degeneration,  regardless of radiculopathy symptoms  [42].  \nMyelography Cervical Spine  \nCT myelography has supplanted fluoroscopic myelography in most circumstances; however, there may be times \nwhen fluoroscopic myelography is also performed prior to CT imaging. The ultimate judgment regarding the \nappropriateness of any specific procedure, lumbar v ersus cervical puncture route, amount  of contrast , and the \nextent and modality of imaging coverage must be made by the radiologist, with appropriate documentation and \ncoding [17]. \nVariant  3: Prior  cervical  spine  surgery.  New or increasing  nontraumatic  cervical  or neck  pain  or \nradiculopathy. Initial imaging.  \nAnterior  cervical  discectomy  and fusion (ACDF)  is a common modality  for the treatment  of radiculopathy and \nmyelopathy that is due  to cervical  disc disease  [43,44]. Potential risks  associated  with ACDF  include  \npseudoarthrosis  [45],  acceleration  of adjacent  segment  degeneration  [46,47], and complications  related  to the \nhardware itself, all of which  may manifest  as new or increasing  nontraumatic  neck  pain.  If infection  is suspected,  \nplease see Variant  4. Imaging of patients with myelopathy should be guided by the separate ACR Appropriateness \nCriteria\u00ae topic on \u201cMyelopathy\u201d  [13]. \nCT Cervical Spine  \nMultidetector CT scanning with high -quality multiplanar reformatted images have enhanced the efficacy of CT \nassessment and imaging findings , particularly around hardware. CT is the most sensitive and specific modality to \nassess spinal fusion [48-50] and can aid in detecting adjacent segment degeneration [51]. A recent review of 690 \npatients who underwent ACDF concluded that CT altered the treatment plan in 39% of patients who had \npersistent symptoms and altered the treatment plan for 60% of patients with persistent symptoms and abnormal \nradiographs or MRI. Furthermore, recent advances in dual -energy CT has shown promise to reduce beam -\nhardening metal artifact , which may improve the evaluation of hardware complications and adjacent segment \ndegeneration in postoperative  patients with new or worsening neck pain [52].

MRI is the most sensitive imaging test for detecting soft -tissue abnormalities associated with neck \npain but is characterized by a high rate of abnormalities in asymptomatic individuals [22, 23]. Most cervical \ndiscectomies are performed by an anterior approach  without transgression of the epidural space ; therefore , \nepidural scar  or granulation tissue formation is minimal,  and contrast -enhanced imaging is not routine ly used after \nACDF  [55].

The addition  of \nflexion/extension  radiographs  may be considered  to improve  detection  of vertebral  body nonunion or \npseudoarthrosis  [62] and may supplement  conventional  views following  ACDF  [63],  cervical  disc implantation , \nor posterior  cervical  fixation  [64-66 ]. \nMyelography Cervical Spine  \nCT myelog raphy has supplanted fluoroscopic myelography in most circumstances; however, there may be times \nwhen fluoroscopic myelography is also performed prior to CT imaging.

However, given that CT is relatively insensitive for tumors restricted \nto the marrow space, the sensitivity of CT is relatively low in early malignant bone involvement [87, 89], and as \nsuch, MRI is favored as an initial diagnostic modality. \nCT Myelography Cervical Spine  \nThe literature search did not identify any studies regarding the use of CT myelography in the evaluation of this \nclinical presentation.  \nCTA Neck  \nThe literature search did not identify any studies regarding the use of CTA in the evaluation of this clinical \npresentation.  \nFluoride PET/CT whole body  \nF-18-sodium fluoride (NaF)  PET/CT has become an important tool for detecting and evaluating metastatic bone \ncancer [90,91] and may be a preferable modality for detecting metastatic bone disease i n morbidly obese patients;  \nhowever, there is currently no evidence supporting the validity  of F-18 NaF PET/CT as a first-line test evaluating \nacute neck pain or radicular symptoms in patients with malignancy.  \nPercutaneous Interventions \nThe literature search did not identify any studies regarding the use of  cervical facet joint, medial branch blocks, or \ndiscography as a first -line test  in the evaluation of this clinical presentation.  \nFDG -PET/CT Whole Body  \nFDG-PET/CT is sensitive for detection of metastatic disease and has been compared to detection rates of bone \nscans [92,93].

Radiographs can also reveal osteolytic lesions at risk for superimposed pathological fracture. However, \ngiven that these osteolytic changes may only be detectable after 50% of th e bone substance has been destroyed \n[87], and lesions up to 1 cm may not be detectable, radiographs alone are not sufficient to exclude metastases in \nthe setting of neck pain in a patient with known mali gnancy.  \nMyelography Cervical Spine  \nCT myelography has supplanted fluoroscopic myelography in most circumstances; however, there may be times when fluoroscopic myelography is also performed prior to CT imaging. The ultimate judgment regarding the \nappropriat eness of any specific procedure, lumbar v ersus cervical puncture route, amount of contrast , and the \nextent and modality of imaging coverage must be made by the radiologist, with appropriate documentation and coding [17]. \nVariant  6: Cervicogenic  headache  and new or increasing  nontraumatic  cervical  or neck  pain.

Suspected  cervicogenic headache presents a true diagnostic  dilemma  secondary  to the myriad  \nof structures that may be the causative factor  of headache in the setting  of neck  pain and the absence of definitive  \nradiographic  findings , leading  to a diagnosis  of cervicogenic headache [100].  It is important  to remember  the \npossibility  of dissection  as a source of acute ipsilateral  headache and neck  pain [101, 102], which  is addressed  in \nthe ACR  Appropriateness Criteria\n\u00ae topic on \u201cHeadache\u201d  [15]. \nCT Cervical Spine  \nThere is no evidence that medical imaging is diagnostic for the etiologies of cervicogenic headache; however, \nimaging may lend support to its diagnosis [103].

The superior  spatial  resolution  of CT helps  identify  regions  of neuroforaminal  \nand spinal  canal  narrowing and should  be considered  in any patient  presenting  with new or worsening  \nradiculopathy  in the setting  of suspected  OPLL. \nCT Myelography Cervical Spine  \nCT myelography performed in flexion and extension has been described to help identify regions of position -\ndependent cord compression related to cervical spinal stenosis from OPLL [121], although it is not routinely used \nin clinical practice.  \nCTA Neck  \nThe literature search did not identify any studies regarding the use of CTA in the evaluation of this clinical \npresentation.  \nPercutaneous Interventio ns \nThe literature search did not identify any studies regarding the use of  cervical facet joint, medial branch blocks, or \ndiscography as a first -line test  in the evaluation of this clinical presentation.  \nMRA Neck  \nThe literature search did not identify any studies regarding the use of MRA in the evaluation of this clinical \npresentation.  \nMRI Cervical Spine  \nDetection  of OPLL on MRI  is limited, with reported  sensitivity  of 32% to 44.3%  [122].  Therefore,  the primary  \nutility  of MRI  in the setting  of OPLL is in the assessment  of cord abutment/signal  changes secondary  to spinal  \ncanal  narrowing.  MRI also affords  the ability  to evaluate the exiting  nerve  roots  in the setting  of radiculopathy.  \nBone Scan Whole Body with SPECT or SPECT/CT Neck  \nThe literature search did not identify any studies regarding the use of bone scan as a first -line test  in the \nevaluation of this clinical presentation. \nMyelography Cervical Spine  \nCT myelography has supplanted fluoroscopic myelography in most circumstances; however, there may be times \nwhen fluoroscopic myelography is also performed prior to CT imaging.

Although  \nerosive osteoarthritis  is often  classified  as a subset  of osteoarthritis  [1], the severity  of clinical  symptoms  often  put \nit in the realm  of inflammatory  arthritis  in terms  of differential  diagnosis.  Although it is much  less common  than \nosteoarthritis, millions  of Americans suffer  from  chronic  extremity  pain from  inflammatory  and crystalline  \narthropathies.  The prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis  (RA),  the most  common  inflammatory  arthritis, has been  \nreported  to be between  0.5% and 1% [2], and the prevalence of gout,  the most  common  crystalline  arthritis, is as \nhigh as 3.9%  of adults  in the United  States  [3]. Imaging plays  an important  role in the diagnosis  and management  \nof inflammatory  and crystalline arthritis. It is important  to consider  global  distribution  of skeletal  involvement,  and \ncorrelating  findings  on multiple  studies/modalities  may be necessary.  Further more , it is critical that imaging  results  \nare interpreted  in the context  of clinical  and serologic  results to add specificity  because there  is significant  overlap  \nof imaging  findings  amongst  the various  types  of arthritis. \nImaging can be used to identify  osseous and/or  soft tissues abnormalities  that are seen with inflammatory  and \ncrystalline  arthritis. In addition  to joint space  narrowing,  the osseous abnormalities  of the extremities  that are \nassessed  include  erosions,  bone  proliferation  in the form  of enthesitis and periostitis , and bone  marrow  edema.  The \nlocation  of the erosions  with respect  to the joint (ie, marginal,  para-articular,  central,  and subenethesial)  is helpful  \nin differential  diagnosis.  Bone  proliferation, in the form  of enthesitis,  is a hallmark  of spondyloarthropathies  and \nmay occur  at any cortical  bone,  including both tendon and ligament  attachments.  Soft tissue abnormalities  of the \nextremities  that are assessed  with imaging include  soft tissue crystal  deposition  and synovial  hypertrophy,  which  \nmay be intraarticular  or involve  tendon sheaths and bursae.  \nThis document  discusses 5 variants:  1) Chronic  extremity  joint pain.

The evidence is inconclusive  as to whether  MRI or US should be considered  the \npreferred  method for evaluation  of RA [18]. \nUS has been  used to evaluate for osseous abnormalities  in the setting  of chronic  inflammatory  arthritis.

Power  Doppler  US is more  accurate for the diagnosis  of synovitis  and has a higher  correlation  \nwith disease activity  compared  with grayscale US [35,36] . Synovitis  on power  Doppler  US and grayscale US are \nboth associated  with the development  of radiographic  erosions  in patients  with RA compared  with grayscale US \n[37,38] .

CPPD  is thought  to have  high prevalence in the elderly  [67] but is underdiagnosed.  CPPD  joint involvement  \nas defined  by EULAR  is when  CPP is detected  in the synovial  fluid  from  affected  joints  [66].

Kransdo rf, MD.q \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nAnkle pain is considered chronic when symptoms persist > 6 weeks. Chronic ankle  pain can be caused by a variety \nof osseous or soft -tissue abnormalities, either alone or in combination. For assessing chronic ankle pain, there are \nmultiple imaging options, including radiography, stress radiography,  computed tomography (CT)  radionuclide \nbone scanning, ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and various injection procedures. Injection \nproce dures include arthrography, CT arthrography, MR arthrography, and diagnostic injection with anesthetic \nagents. Although there are numerous causes for chronic ankle pain, common etiologies include osteoarthritis, \nosteochondral injury, tendon abnormalities, ligament abnormalities and instability, and impingement.  \nOverview of Imaging Modalities  \nRadiography Radiographs can provide information about the osseous and soft -tissue structures about the ankle. Routine \nradiographs of the ankle typically include anteroposterior, lateral, and mortise views, the latter obtained by internally rotating the foot 15 to 20 degrees.  Stress radiographs can be used to assess ankle instability  [1,2]; \nhowever , some have questioned their accuracy [3 ,4]. \nCT \nCT is not routinely used as a first -line imaging tool in chronic ankle pain, but it is more sensitive than \nradiographs, particularly for osseous abnormalities  [5]. CT arthrography may be more accurate than MR \narthrography for the identification of osteochondral abnormalities  [6]. \nBone Scan  \nConventional planar bone scintigraphy can assess osseous pathology.  More recently, single -photon emission \ncomputed tomogr aphy (SPECT)  combined with CT has been shown to provide additional information compared \nwith clinical diagnosis and conventional bone scintigraphy for the evaluation of impingement syndromes and soft -\ntissue pathology [7]. In addition, SPECT/CT abnormalities have been shown to significantly correlate with pain  in \nosteochondral lesions  [8]. \nUS \nUS can be used to evaluate for soft -tissue abnormalities, including tendon and ligament tears. In inflammatory \narthritis, it can help in the assessment of disease activity and severity as well as detect subclinical pathology in \nearly disease or after treatment [9 ]. US is ideal for dynamic assessment of peroneal tendon instability [10] and can \nbe used to guide interventions  [11]. Compared with some other modalities, US is less prone to artifacts, such as \nsusceptibility, motion, magic angle , and streak artifact, but dynamic assessment may be limited in cases of pain.  \nMRI  \nMRI is the imaging test that globally evaluates all anatomic structures, including ligaments, tendons, cartilage, \nand bone  [12,13]. Most studies have shown that MRI is highly accurate for evaluation of ligament, tendon,  and \n \naPrincipal Author and Panel Chair,  VA San Diego Healthcare System, San Diego, California . bResearch Author, University of California San Diego Medical \nCenter, San Diego, California.  cUniversity of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.  dRush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois; \nAmerican College of Physicians.  ePenn State Milton S.

Initial imaging . \nRadiography \nRadiography should be considered as the initial imaging study . Radiographs may reveal osteoarthritis, calcified or \nossif ied intra -articular bodies, osteochondral abnormalities, stress fractures,  or evidence of prior trauma. Ankle \neffusions may also be identified in the anterior ankle joint recess by radiography with 53% to 74% accuracy  [19]. \nThey are often associated with ligamentous injury or fracture [19]. The presence of ossific fragments can indicate \nligamentous injury or retinaculum avulsion [20], whereas periostitis can occur adjacent to tenosynovitis. \nRadiographs can also identify synovial osteochondromatosis and erosions from chronic synovitis.  \nCT \nCT is not routinely used as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain.  \nMRI  \nMRI is not routinely used as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain.  \nUS \nUS is not routinely used  as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain.  \nBone Scan  \nBone scan is not routinely used as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain.  \nVariant 2: Chronic ankle pain.

One multimodality study [5 ] showed that \n41% of osteochondral abnormalities of the ankle were missed on radiography.  \nMRI  \nIn one multimodality study, MRI performed similar ly to arthroscopy for the evaluation of osteochondral \nabnorm alities of the ankle [5]. Although MRI had the highest sensitivity (96%), it was less specific than CT [5 ]. \nMRI is effective in determining osteochondral injury instability (sensitivity 97%), most commonly appearing as a \nhigh signal line deep to the os teochondral lesion on T2-weighted images or less commonly as a focal defect, an \narticular fracture, or an adjacent cyst [28]. MRI has also been used to stage these lesions preoperatively with an \naccuracy of 81% [29] and to assess osteochondral abnormalities after cartilage repair [30]. Although MRI may be \nless reliable than CT arthrography for talar cartilaginous lesions (accuracy between 76 % to 88%) [6], high-\nresolution MRI using a microscopy coil (e g, a 4 -cm receive-only surface coil) can assist in detecting small, \nclinically relevant features of talar osteochondral lesions that may be missed on standard MRI, including \nosteochondral junction separation due to focal collapse of the subchondral bone, reparative cartilage hypertrophy, \nand bone separation in the absence of cartilage fracture [31].  \nCT Arthrography  \nThe introduction of contrast into the ankle joi nt prior to CT will outline a cartilage surface defect, assisting in \nlesion detection and assessment for instability. One study comparing CT arthrography and MR arthrography for \ntalar cartilaginous lesions found an accuracy between 76 % to 88% using MR arthrography compared to 90% to \n92% for CT arthrography, suggesting that CT arthrography may be more reliable [6 ]. \nMR Arthrography  \nThe introduction of contrast into the  ankle joint prior to MRI will outline a cartilage surface defect, assisting in \nlesion detection and assessment for instability. One study comparing CT arthrography and MR arthrography for talar cartilaginous lesions found an accuracy between 76 % to 88% us ing MR arthrography compared to 90% to \n92% for CT arthrography, suggesting that CT arthrography may be more reliable [6 ]. \nCT \nIn one multimodality study, CT (noncont rast, multidetector with multiplanar reformatted images) performed \nsimilar ly to arthroscopy for the evaluation of osteochondral abnormalities of the ankle  [5]. However, CT was \nmore specific (99%) but less sensitive then MRI [5 ]. \nBone Scan  with SPECT or  SPECT /CT \nWhen osteochondral injuries are associated with fracture, osseous cyst, or osteochondral defect, bone scans may \nshow the abnormality. One study evaluating the role of SPECT/CT in assessing osteochondral defects in the ankle \nfound that this study affected the surgeon\u2019s ultimate decision regarding treatment in 48 % to 52% of cases , as it \nallowed for improved evaluation of the subchondral bone and subchondral bone plate [32].

It ha s been shown \nto produce similar results as MRI in diagnosing ankle tendon tears, although US results are more dependent on \noperator skill and expertise [10, 35]. In this case,  it is assumed that the procedure is performed and interpreted by \nan expert. One study showed that it had a sensitivity of 100% and an accuracy of 93% compared to surgical \nfindings [36].  With regard to the tibialis posterior tendon, one  study evaluating tendon pathology showed that US \nwas slightly less sensit ive than MRI; however, this difference did not significantly affect clinical management \n[37]. One study using US showed 100% sensitivity and 90% accuracy in diagnosing peroneal tendon tears [38]; \nsuggesting that US may be more useful than MRI. With regard to chronic Achilles tendinopathy, US detected 21  \nof 26 cases of tendinosis and partial rupture [39 ], and another study showed that US can differentiate full -\nthickness from partial -thickness Achilles tears with 92% accuracy [40].  In addition to the diagnostic capabilities \nof US, when a tendon abnormality is detected, it can be used to guide interventions such as concurrent \nperformance of US -guided intrasheath anesthetic injections [11 ]. It can also be used for direct intratendinous \nbiologic injection and dry needling [41-43 ]. \nOne significant advantage of US is in the dynamic assessment for tendon subluxation (including intrasheath \nsubluxation) and dislocation, with a reported positive predictive value of 100% compared to surgical findings  \n[44,45]. \nUS-guided sheath injections are more accurate than palpation guided and allow for precise positioning of the \nneedle tip in the sheath rather than  the tendon substance because a large volume intratendinous injection of \ncorticosteroids or local anesthetic can result in a split tear  [46].  \nUS can detect intratendinous tophi in gout, enthesitis of the Achilles tendon or plantar fascia in spondyloarthritis, and tenosynovitis in spondyloarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis  [47].  \nMRI  \nIt is generally accepted that MRI can achieve high sensitivities (>90%) in diagnosing ankle tendon tears [16]. \nRegarding tibialis posterior tendon, MRI is more sensitive than US ; however, this difference did not significantly \naffect clinical management [37]. With regard to peroneal  tendinopathy and tendon tear, one  study found the \nsensitivities and specificities of MRI to be 83.9% and 74.5%, respectively, for tendinopathy and 54.5% and \n88.7%, respectively, for tendon tears [48].  With regard to c hronic Achilles tendinopathy, MRI detected  26 of 27 \ncases of tendinosis and partial rupture [39]. MRI repo rted a 66% accuracy rate for assessment for tendon \nsubluxation and dislocation [44, 45].

Additionally, MRI identified the exact location of the injury in 93% of \nthe cases [15].  Comparing MRI with arthroscopy, studies have shown a range of accuracies of chronic lateral \nligament tearing (either partial or complete), ranging from 77 % to 92% for the anterior talofibular ligament and \n88% to 92% for the calcaneofibular ligament [14, 52]. For the evaluation of deep deltoid ligament tears, MRI is \nboth sensitive and specific compared with arthroscopy, with reported values of 96% and 98%, respectively [53].  \nWith regard to tears of the tibiofibular ligaments of the tibiofibular syndesmosis, MRI has a reported accuracy of 100% [54]. Additionally, MRI can also demonstrate interosseous membrane tears [55]. MRI offers the advantage \nof evaluating for injuries associated with or mimicking lateral instability that may not be diagnosed on stress radiography such as tenosynovitis, tendon injury, and osteochondral lesions [56]. MRI may also be used to evaluate the ankle after lateral ligament reconstruction [57].  \nMR Arthrography  \nMR arthrography can be helpful for the assessment of chronic ankle instability due to lateral collateral ligament injuries [12].  \nUS \nOne study evaluating anterior talofibular ligamen t injury demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy of 91% for US when \ncompared to arthroscopic findings. Additionally, US identified the exact location of the injury in 63% of cases \n[15]. Another study comparing US and CT arthrography for the diagnos is of anterior talofibular ligament injury \nshowed an accuracy of 61%  using US and 71% for CT arthrography [58]. US also has the dynamic capability of \nstressing the ligament and looking for laxity or frank separation of the injure d ligament  [1,59]. \nWith regard to interosseous membrane tears, US has a proven sensitivity of 89% and specificity of  94.5% in \ndiagnosing interosseous membrane tears shown at surgery [55, 60]. \nRadiography \nStress radiograp hs can be used to assess ankle instability  [1,2]; however, some have questioned their accuracy \n[3,4].

Next study . \nImaging can also be used to diagnose ankle impingement syndromes, which can occur in the anterolateral, \nanterior, anteromedial, posteromedial, and posterior aspects of the ankle joint [62 -71].  \nMR Arthrography  \nMR arthrography has been found to be an accurate method for assessing both anterolateral and anteromedial \nimpingement with the advantage of joint capsule distention by intra -articular contrast injection [68, 69]. \nUS \nOne study involving anterolateral ankle impingement compared US to arthroscopic findings.

Comparing MRI wi th surgical findings, studies have shown sensitivities between 75 % to 83% and specificity between 75 % to \n100% for the diagnosis of anterolateral impingement [73, 74]. \nOne study found that , when compared with arthroscopy,  fat-suppressed, IV contrast -enhanced, 3 -D gradient -\nrecalled echo imaging was sensitive for the evaluation of synovitis of the ankle associated wit h trauma (92%), \nwhereas it was specific for soft -tissue impingement evaluation (97%) when the ankle was divided into four \ncompartments: the anterolateral gutter, anteromedial gutter, anterior recess, and posterior recess [75].  \nMRI is useful in confirming the diagnosis, evaluating patients with an uncertain clinical diagnosis, and planning \nsurgery. Additionally, it can help exclude other pathologic entities that may mimic or coexist with impinge ment \nsyndromes. However, MRI features supportive of impingement may be present in asymptomatic individuals, and \nan accurate diagnosis requires careful correlation of imaging features findings with clinical findings [76]. There \nare only limited reports on the use of MRI for the other forms of ankle impingement syndrome, so its accuracy in \nthese conditions is not well established [62, 64,67,68]. \nCT Arthrography  \nOne study involving anterolateral ankle impingement compared CT arthrography to arthroscopic findings. The \nstudy found that CT arthrography had a sensitivity and specificity of 97% and 71%, respectively [77].  \nImage-guided Anesthetic Injection  \nFluoroscopic  or US-guided injection s have been shown as an effective treatment for some  ankle impingement \nsyndromes [78,79]. \nBone Scan with SPECT or SPECT/CT  \nRecently, SPECT combined with CT has been shown to provide additional information compared with clinical diagnosis and conventional bone scintigraphy for the evaluation of impingement syndromes and soft -tissue \npathology [7]. One study found that SPECT/CT provided information not sus pected on clinical diagnosis in 56% \nof cases with impingement syndromes or soft -tissue pathology [7 ]. \nCT \nCT may be useful for depiction of osseous causes of imp ingement, such as chronic abnormalities between the \ntalus and an os trigonum or fractures of the lateral tubercle of the talus or os trigonum [62].  \nArthrography  \nArthrography is not routinely used for the evaluation of ankle impingement syndromes.  \nRadiography Stress views are not routinely used for the evaluation of ankle impingement syndromes.  \nVariant 7: Chronic ankle pain.

Beaman,  MD.n \nSummary  of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nChronic  elbow  pain is a common  patient  complaint  in the primary  care setting. Patients  may report  symptoms  of \nswelling,  pain,  restricted  range  of motion,  stiffness,  and numbness  or tingling  [1]. There is a wide  differential  \ndiagnosis  for chronic  elbow  pain, including osseous,  soft tissue,  cartil aginous , and nerve -related  abnormalities.  \nEpicondylalgia , caused  by tendinosis  of the common  extensor  tendon laterally  (\u201ctennis elbow\u201d)  or medially  the \ncommon  flexor  tendon  (\u201cgolfer\u2019s  elbow \u201d), is the most  common  cause of chronic  elbow  pain,  estimated  to occur in \n1% to 3% of the population  [2]. Epicondylalgia  is associated  with lost workdays  and a significant  economic  burden  \n[3]. Both  occupational  and recreational  causes play a role in development  of epicondylalgia  as well as other  causes  \nof chronic  elbow  pain,  including  biceps tendinopathy,  osteochondral  injuries, collateral  ligament  tears,  and cubital  \ntunnel  syndrome.  \nImaging plays  an important  role in assessment  of chronic  elbow  pain.  Electromyography  assists in the workup \nrelated  to nerve  symptoms.  Management  for epicondylalgia  and osteoarthritis  includes  conservative measures such \nas rest, activity  modification, analgesia,  physical  therapy,  and corticosteroid  injections. Surgery  may be indicated  \nfor more  severe or refractory  cases and cases of collateral  ligament  injury,  biceps injury, cubital  tunnel  syndrome,  \nor osteochondral  abnormalities.  \nSpecial Imaging  Considerations  \nStress radiographs  to detect  medial  joint line opening  and/or  asymmetry  to the contralateral  elbow  are available to \nevaluate valgus  instability  of the elbow.  \nInitial Imaging  Definition \nInitial imaging  is defined  as imaging  at the beginning of the care episode for the medical  condition defined  by the \nvariant.  More  than one procedure  can be considered  usually  appropriate  in the initial imaging  evaluation  when : \n\u2022 There are procedures  that are equivalent  alternatives (ie, only one procedure  will be ordered  to \nprovide  the clinical  information  to effectively  manage the patient\u2019s  care)  \nOR \n\u2022 There are complementary  procedures  (ie, more  than one procedure  is ordered  as a set or \nsimultaneously  where each procedure  provides  unique  clinical  information  to effectively  manage  \nthe patient\u2019s  care).  \n \naPenn  State  Milton  S.

Kransdorf, MD.n \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nChronic foot pain is a frequent clinical complaint with approximately 14% to 42% of adults in the United States \nreporting foot problems, often with significant impact on mobility, difficulty performing daily activities , and \nincreased risk of falling, particularly in older individuals [1,2] . Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a \nsignificant improvement in health-related quality of life with effective treatment of foot pain [3] . Estimating the \nprevalence of chron ic foot pain is challenging, because there is no consensus regarding the definition of chronic \npain in the literature. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines chronic pain as any pain persisting \npast the normal healing time, suggesting 3 months in case of chronic pain of benign causes.  \nWomen are more commonly affected , and forefoot conditions are more frequent. Persistent pain for more than 6  \nyears has been reported in 51% of women between 70 to 75 years of age [4]. Because of  the wide range of causes \nof chronic foot pain, assessment of these patients with imaging studies in addition to a dedicated clinical \nexamination is often needed [1] . \nThe guidelines of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons divide heel pain into plantar heel pain,  usually \nrelated to pathology of the plantar fascia, and posterior heel pain,  usually related to pathology of  the Achilles tendon, \nand treatment options vary from nonoperative treatments to surgical procedures [5] . \nChronic foot pain in children, symptoms related to soft -tissue or bone neoplasms and pain related to infectious \nconditions, inflammatory arthropathies, or other systemic diseases are beyond the scope of this document. \nEvaluation of patients with neuropathic foot or Charcot arthropathy is addressed in the ACR Appropriateness \nCriteria\u00ae topic on \u201c Suspected Osteomyelitis of the Foot in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus \u201d [6]. Posttraumatic \nentities affecting the ankle,  including instability, arthrosis, osteochondral defects, osteonecrosis, and tendinop athies,  \nare discussed in  ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae topic on \u201cChronic Ankle Pain \u201d [7].

Unknown etiology. Initial imaging.  \nBone Scan Foot  \nThere is no relevant literature  to support t he use of nuclear medicine studies as the first imaging  study  in the \nevaluation of chronic foot pain.  \nCT Foot  \nThere is no relevant literature to support the use of CT as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot \npain.  \nMRI Foot  \nThere is no r elevant literature  to support the use of MRI as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot \npain.  \nRadiography Foot  \nConventional radiography can be useful to distinguish among different causes of chronic foot pain and is usually \nthe first imag ing study in evaluating patients with chronic foot pain.  \nThe value of radiographs in the diagnosis of tarsal coalitions has been extensively demonstrated. Overall \nsensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs \nin the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral \nand oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar \ncoalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs \non the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have \nbeen found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable \nmethods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  \nRadiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review \nby Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for \nradiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.  \nRadiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  \nusually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, \nosteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite \nversus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess \nwith radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton\u2019s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other \ncauses of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg\u2019s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals \nor soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . \nThough radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in \npatients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The \ncombination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a \nspecificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15]. \nUS Foot  \nUltrasound (US) is usually not indicate d as the first imaging  study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain, but may \nbe performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of pathologic conditions of the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, \nand other conditions such as tarsal tunnel syndrome, Morton\u2019s  neuroma , plantar plate tears,  and intermetatarsal \nbursitis. \nVariant 2: Persistent posttraumatic foot pain.

There is no relevant literature to support the routine cl inical use of nuclear \nmedicine studies in the evaluation of CRPS type II.  \nCT Foot  \nThere is no relevant literature  to support the use of CT in the evaluation of suspected CRPS . \nMRI Foot  \nCRPS is subdivided into type I and type II. CRPS type I encompasses ref lex sympathetic dystrophy and similar \nconditions without a nerve injury, whereas CRPS type II occurs after a nerve injury [18] . Several findings have \nbeen  described on MRI in patients with early and advanced CRPS type I reflex sympathetic dystrophy [19,20] . In \ngeneral, MRI has been found to be a specific but nonsensitive method in the diagnosis of CRPS type I. In a study \nby Sch\u00fcrmann et al [19], contrast -enhanced MRI was found to have a sensitivity of 13% to 43% and a specificity \nof 78% to 98%, resulting in low PPV and moderate NPV,  suggesting that MRI cannot be used as a screening test. \nIn contrast, Schweitzer et al [20] demonstrated higher sensitivity (87%) and PPV (100%) for contrast -enhanced \nMRI. A meta -analysis by Cappello et al [17] reported pooled specificity, sensitivity, NP V, and PPV for MRI in the \ndiagnosis of CRPS t ype I of 91%, 35%, 51%, and 64%, respectively. Although there is paucity in the literature \nregarding MRI in the diagnosis of CRPS type II, given its capability to directly visualize and characterize the nerves \nand to detect signs of muscle denervation, MRI may be useful in cases of CRPS type II [21] . \nUS Foot  \nA few studies addressing the role of US in the diagnosis of CRPS type I reflex sympathetic dystrophy have been \npublished. There is evidence showing that patients who have CRPS type I affecting the lower  extremity have \nincreased power Doppler flow compared with asymptomatic control subjects with a sensitivity of 73% and \nspecificity of 92% [22] . Although there is no relevant literature  to support the routine clinical use of US in the \ndiagnosis of CRPS type II, high-resolu tion US may have a role giving its increasing use in nerve assessment [23] . \nVariant 3: Chronic metatarsalgia including plantar great toe pain. Radiographs negative or equivocal. \nClinical concern includes sesamoiditis, Morton\u2019s  neuroma, intermetatarsal bursitis, chronic plantar plate \ninjury, or Freiberg\u2019s infraction. Next imaging study.  \nBone Scan Foot  \nPlanar b one scintigraphy has low anatomic resolution and has been shown to be a nonspecific technique to assess \nthe hallucal sesamoids [24]. However, bone scintigraphy with single -photon emission computed tomography \n(SPECT)/CT increases contrast resolution and anatomic localization of foci with increased osteoblastic activity  \n[25]. Bone scintigraphy may demonstrate increased uptake in pathologic conditions affecting the fir st metatarsal \nsesamoids not evident on radiographs. A less dramatic uptake is noted in stress fractures, which may be helpful to \ndifferentiate between them and acute fractures [26]. When an indeter minate linear lucency is visualized on \nradiographs, a negative bone scintigraphy suggest s sesamoid bipartition [12] .

Given that, some of the find ings in patients with plantar fasciitis are nonspecific; these findings can also \nbe seen in asymptomatic patients.  MRI should always be correlated with clinical symptoms to avoid overcalling \nplantar fasciitis. Although no significant differences have been found in plantar fascia thickness on US and MRI, \nMRI is currently considered the most sensitive imaging study  in the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis [53]. There is no \nrelevant literature supporting the routine use of contrast in the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis or tears.  \nUS Foot  \nUS has shown good sensitivity (80%) and specificity (88%) in the dia gnosis of plantar fasciitis when compared to \nMRI [54].

Next imaging study.  \nBone Scan Foot  \nBone scintigraphy is a sensitive but not specific technique to detect occult  fractures because of  its capability to \ndetect increased osteoblastic activity. Although bone scans may reveal focal uptake at the site of a radiographically \noccult fracture, given the anatomical complexity of the foot particularly the midfoot, precise localization may be \nlimited [59]. SPECT/CT may improve the diagnosis of patients with suspected fractures because of the more precise \nanatomical localization [60].  \nSymptomatic accessory navicular bones were initially studied with Tc-99m -MDP bone scans and were repo rted to \nshow increased radiotracer uptake at the synchondrosis,  apparently  due to the chronic stress reaction [61] . A \nnegative bone scan can exclude the presence of a symptomatic accessory ossicle, but positive findings lack \nspecificity [62]. Isotope bone scans , when combined with CT , may be positive in cases of painful accessory ossicles \nbut remain rel ative ly insensitive for some soft -tissue pathology [63].  \nCT Foot  \nCT is useful for the detection of radiographically occult fractures.

The utility of MRI in the detection of radiographically occult Chopart \nfractures has been demonstrated by Almeida et al [64] . Baker et al [71]  analyzed 31 occult fractures involving the \nankle and foot in h ockey players,  finding five occult fractures in the foot, all of which involved the navicular bone. \nPierre -Jerome et al [72] found 79% of cuboid fractures in the diabetic population that were radiographically occult \nusing MRI.

On US, these can be seen as cortical irregularities and are frequently associated with soft -tissue injury in \nthe acute or subacute setting.

Kransdorf, MD.n \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nIn patients with chronic wrist pain, imaging studies are  an important adjunct to history, physical examination, \nlaboratory testing, and electrophysiology studies. The choice of imaging modality depends on the patient\u2019s \npresentation and the clinical questions being asked. There are scenarios in which no imaging beyond baseline \nradiographs is necessary, but in other situations advanced imaging has added value for diagnostic eva luation and \ntreatment planning.  \nOverview of Imaging Modalities  \nRadiographs  \nImaging evaluation of the painful wrist should begin with radiog raphs [1,2]. This simple study may establish a \nspecific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, \nimpaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -\nanterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or \nmore oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling \n[3]. A v ariety of stress positions and maneuvers can be performed to elicit dynamic instability that is not visible \non standard radiographs [ 4]. Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. \nAdditionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ]. \nIn the past , fluoroscopic observation was used to establish the diagnosis of dynamic wrist inst ability. However, in \nmost practices,  fluoroscopy is used either for g uidance during wrist injections  or as an adjunct to arthrography.  \nPercutaneous aspiration of the wrist \u2014which is indicated in cases of suspected septic arthritis or to assess for intra-\narticular crystals\u2014can be carried out with either fluoroscopic or ultrasound (US) guidance  if needed . \nScintigraphy  \nBone scintigraphy has been used for diagnosing occult wrist fractures and as a screening procedure in patients \nwith wrist pain and negative radi ographs. However, while it is sensitive to bone abnormalities, scintigraphy \nsuffers from a lack of specificity [6 ].

Because of these limitations, \narthrography  has now largely been supplanted by cross-sectional imaging. Fluoroscopic -guided intra -articular \ninjections are chiefly used as a first step when performing arthrographic  computed tomography ( CT) and \nmagnetic resonance imaging (MR I) studies [8]. \nMRI  \nWrist MRI accurately depicts abnormalities of the bones and bone marrow, articular cartilage, intrinsic and \nextrinsic ligaments, TFCC, synovium, tendons, and neurovascular structures, making it a powerful study for \nchronic pai n caused by diverse etiologies.  \nA dedicated receiver coil or transmit -receive coil is necessary to provide the signal -to-noise ratio needed for high-\nresolution, high-contrast MRI of the wrist [9 ]. MR arthrography \u2014either with direct contrast injection into one  or \nmore wrist compartments or performed indirectly after intravenous (IV) contrast administration \u2014can enhance the \nyield of the study for diagnosing internal wrist derangements, especially abnormalities of the ligaments, articular cartilage, and TFCC of the wrist. MRI performed with a 3.0 T magnet and a dedicated coil provides better signal -\nto-noise ratio and better contrast compared with wrist MR I performed with 1.5 T  or lower field strength systems \n[10,11]. \nCT \nCT of the wr ist is used primarily when high-det ail imaging of bone cortex or trabeculae is needed. In patients with \nchronic wrist pain and prior fractures, CT is typically the study of choice to evaluate fracture healing and joint \ncongruence. When a radiographically occult fracture is suspected as the cause of a patient\u2019s chronic pain, either \nCT or MRI can be used [12]. Advantages of CT over MRI for the wrist include  its ability to obtain high -resolution \nimages of both wrists simultaneously and the much shorter acquisition times for CT. These factors make CT the \npreferred examination for suspected distal radioulnar joint subluxation, where images of both wrists can be  \nobtained in both supination and pronation [1 ,13]. A disadvantage of CT  is its lower sensitivity to soft -tissue \nabnormalities  compared with MRI.  \nHigh-resolution (typically multidetector) CT of the wrist following contrast injection into one or more wrist \ncompartments (CT arthrography) is a powerful tool for diagnosing intra -articular abnormalities [14,15]. The \nintraobserver agreement on CT arthrogram images is extremely high and better than that reported for MRI \n[14,16]. \nUS \nUS of the wrist is useful for examining extra -articular soft tissues, such as suspected ganglion cyst s [17], because \nits accuracy is similar to that of MRI. US can also be used to diagnose abnormalities of the flexor and extensor \ntendons and tendon sheaths. For de Quervain disease (stenosing tenosynovitis of the abductor pollicis lon gus and \nextensor pollicis brevis tendon compartment), preoperative identification of a septum or subcompartmentalization \nwithin the first dorsal compartment with US  may affect surgical management [18 ,19]. \nIn patients with suspected or established rheumatoid arthritis (RA), US examination of the wrist and selected \nfinger joints can identify erosions and active synovit is (with the use of power Doppler), findings that influence \nearly diagnosis and treatment decisions [20]. Using US to measure the size of the median nerve is a  validated  \ntechnique in patients with clinical symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome [21-24].  \nIn addition, w rist US is a useful technique to guide therapeutic intr a-articular and other soft -tissue injections [25].  \nDiscussion of Procedures by Variant  \nVariant 1: Chronic wrist pain.

Advanced imaging is usually performed to determine disease activity, guide management decisions, and prognosticate outcomes. In patients with RA, US  of the wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints can  show \ninflammation  as active synovitis. Identifying active synovitis with power Doppler assessment is a useful adjunct \nin making an early diagnosis of RA when a pati ent with early arthritis does not meet the 2010 criteria established \nby the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism [20]. The presence of \nsynovitis predicts progression of erosions [31 ] and erosions themselves [35]. US can also depict small bone \nerosions with high spatial resolution; h owever, US is less sensitive to erosions that occur on the radial or ulnar \nsides of the inner carpal bones because direct scanning of these regions is blocked, unlike the dorsal and volar \nbone surfaces. Furthermore, unlike MRI, US cannot show changes within the bone marrow, which are  the \nstrongest prognosticator s for disease progression in RA [27, 28,32-34].

Radiographs normal or nonspecific . Next study.  \nMRI Wrist  \nBoth traumatic and degenerative lesions of the TFCC can produce chronic, ulnar -sided wrist pain . MRI is highly \naccurate for lesions involving the radial (central) zone of the disc, especially with the use of high -resolution fast \nspin-echo or 3-D grad ient-recalled pulse sequences [36]. There is some evidence suggesting that MRI performed \nwith a 3.0 T system is even more accurate than MRI performed with a 1.5 T system for TFCC lesions [37], but \nthere are no studies comparing the accuracy of the two field s trengths in the same patients. The sensitivity for \ntears of the ulnar attachment of the disc and the peripheral attachments (the ulnocarpal ligaments) are only fair \nwith noncontrast -enhanced wrist MRI [ 12,36]. IV contrast seldom provides added benefit in patients with ulnar -\nsided wrist pain but may increase sensitivity for TFCC lesions if MR arthrography is desired but direct joint \ninjection is not feasible. \nMR Arthrography  Wrist  \nDirect MR arthrography (performed with contrast injection of the radiocarpal or distal radioulnar compartments, \nalone or in combination) does result in better diagnostic accuracy for the T FCC compared with conventional MRI, \nespecially for ulnar -sided lesions [26, 38], even when compared to conventio nal MRI performed with a 3.0 T \nmagnet [7,8,39]. The same is true for intrinsic ligament injuries, such as those of the lunotriquetral ligament, \nwhich can produce ulnar -sided pain [7 ,8,39]. Performing either MR arthrography or noncontrast -enhanced MRI is \nusually appropriate in this scenario.  \nCT Arthrography  Wrist  \nThe accuracy of CT arthrography is superior to MRI  and similar to that  of MR arthrography for TFCC and \nintrinsic ligament lesions [8,40]. In addition, CT arthrography appears to be mor e accurate than either MRI or  MR \narthrography for identifying articular cartilage defects in the wrist [38]. In contrast to MRI and MR arthrography, \nCT arthrography is less sensitive to lesions occurring outside of the joint (like abnormalities of the extensor carpi \nulnaris tendon) that can result in ulnar -sided pain.  For these reasons, CT arthrography may be appropriate in this \nsetting , especially if there is a contraindication to MRI or if artifact from metallic implants produce too much \nartifact on MRI.  \nArthrography  Wrist  \nConventional (x-ray) arthrography\u2014performed with contrast injection into one  or more  wrist compartments\u2014has \nmoderate accuracy for the diagnosis of TFCC perforations [7 ].", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2f7da49e-4e34-4f56-be93-22da11e2e35c": {"__data__": {"id_": "2f7da49e-4e34-4f56-be93-22da11e2e35c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "ACR chronic hand and wrist pain.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "634bdd2c-13c8-4234-aaf8-9df8a4d8ebda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "ACR chronic hand and wrist pain.pdf"}, "hash": "e031fcde767e844c14aa41a61ed506056bf73e601310ae61e3e504098bdb3cc7"}, "2": {"node_id": "e29120f4-1644-4bf3-97a4-c7f5245e86e7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "ACR chronic hand and wrist pain.pdf"}, "hash": "1168d135fc06a289b7000d3bdc29cac224135df5d6b26c45e82cd158abede440"}}, "hash": "6f4064c06f3d00fab73055c4c9dd5ab0acb8c4579e6852fc2daf19d65dcde091", "text": "For these reasons, CT arthrography may be appropriate in this \nsetting , especially if there is a contraindication to MRI or if artifact from metallic implants produce too much \nartifact on MRI.  \nArthrography  Wrist  \nConventional (x-ray) arthrography\u2014performed with contrast injection into one  or more  wrist compartments\u2014has \nmoderate accuracy for the diagnosis of TFCC perforations [7 ].

MRI is useful for diagnosing infectious and noninfectious tenosynovitis in \nboth the flexor and extensor wrist compartments [46]. Occult ganglion cysts are also easily identified with MRI, \nbut some authors recommend use of IV contrast to distinguish ganglia from synovitis [ 47]. For noncystic soft-\ntissue masses, MRI may demonstrate findings that are diagnostic for certain benign conditions (eg, lipomas, \nhemangiomas, benign nerve sheath tumors), and can stage the extent of involvement for nonspecific masses ( see \nthe ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae topic on \u201c Soft-Tissue Masses \u201d [48]). \nUS Wrist  \nWrist US or MRI (without or without  and with IV contrast) are alternative initial examinations that are usually \nappropriate in this setting.

MRI is highly \nsensitive to changes in bone marrow composition, and thus is frequently used to identify radiographically occult \nacute fractures throughout the skeleton, including in the wrist (see the ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae topic on \n\u201cAcute Hand and Wrist Trauma\u201d [49]). In patients with persistent symptoms thought to be due to an occult wrist \nfracture, MRI can be used as an alternative to presumptive casting and repeat radiographs [ 12]. MRI is also \nsensitive to stress fractures and stress injuries of the physes, for example, in gymnasts [50].

MRI shows only moderate sensitivity and specificity for predicting osteonecrosis of t he proximal pole of scaphoid fractures, and \neven some scaphoid fractures with MRI evidence of osteonecrosis may still heal with treatment [57]. While the \naddition of IV  contrast , especially given dynamically,  can improve  the accuracy for osteonecrosis and predicting \ngraft healing, the routine use of IV  contrast for this indication is controversial: while nonenhancement of the \nproximal scaphoid pole is a reliable sign of osteonecrosis, enhancement can be seen in both viabl e and nonviable \nfracture fragments [58].  MRI with IV contrast  may be appropriate for these patients. Additionally, unlike the case \nfor the knee and other larger joints, MRI shows only fair sensitivity for depicting articular cartilage defects in the \ndistal radius and carpal bones, even with the use of indirect MR ar thrography or 3.0 T scanners [59,60]. The \npresence of focal bone marrow edema may be a clue to underl ying chondral defects [59]. Despite these \nlimitations, noncontrast MRI and noncontrast CT are both usually appropriate exam ination s to evaluate potential \nsequelae of chronic scaphoid fractures, but only one of the tests needs to be performed for a given patient.

Radiographs normal or nonspecific. Suspect carpal tunnel syndrome.  Next \nstudy. \nUS Wrist \nSeveral meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the \ncarpal  tunnel  inlet) is highly accurate for identifying carpal  tunnel syndrome  diagnosed clinically or with the \ncombination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US \nvaries depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the \nmeasurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary \nexamination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel \nsyndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal \ntunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, \nclinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of \ncarpal tunnel syndrome. US may be appropriate in cases where this initial evaluation is equivocal.  \nMRI Wrist  \nHistorically, carpal tunnel syndrome has been diagnosed based on clinical signs and sympt oms and confirmed by \nthe results of electrodiagnostic studies [67]. MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in cases in which this  \ninitial evaluation is equivocal. The MRI findings that have been reported in wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome \u2014\nincluding nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing\u2014may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value \nin patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68]. In rare cases of secondary carpal tunnel syndrome, MRI may identify \na mass lesion compressing the median nerve. There is some evidence that the length of T2 hyperintensity in the \nmedian nerve can help prognosticate the success of surgery [69] and that the shape and signal of the nerve predict \nclinical response to a steroid injection in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome [70 ]. MR neurography \nmay be an option in patients with suspected carpal tunnel syndrome.  The use o f IV contrast does not contribute to \ndiagnosis and is usually not appropriate.  \nMR Arthrography  Wrist  \nMR arthrography is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.  \nCT Wrist  \nCT, with or without IV  contrast, is not routinely used to diagnose carpa l tunnel syndrome.  \nCT Arthrography  Wrist  \nCT arthrography is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.  \nBone Scan  Wrist  \nBone scan is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.  \nArthrography  Wrist  \nRadiographic arthrography  is not routinely us ed to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome . \nSummary of Recommendations  \n\u2022 Wrist radiographs are indicated as the best initial imaging examination in patients with chronic wrist pain. \n\u2022 When radiographs are normal or equivocal and a patient has persistent symptoms wi th an unclear diagnosis, \nMRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate.  \n\u2022 In patients with suspected inflammatory arthritis, MRI either with or without IV contrast is usually \nappropriate if guidance for management or prognostication is needed.  \n\u2022 Patients with  suspected wrist infection should undergo aspiration.  \n\u2022 When radiographs are normal or equivocal in a patient with ulnar -sided pain, either MRI without IV contrast \nor an MR arthrogram of the wrist is usually appropriate.  \n\u2022 When radiographs are normal or equivocal in a patient with radial -sided pain, MRI without IV contrast is \nusually appropriate.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a4d2def1-2382-434b-b0c1-8dd47b8f1ffa": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4d2def1-2382-434b-b0c1-8dd47b8f1ffa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "ACR chronic hand and wrist pain.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8e670ead-957f-4a4a-8bba-27a70837ee01", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "ACR chronic hand and wrist pain.pdf"}, "hash": "9945fa27f10fa974af205131e799ff27f5a1e5e2eea2e4f4130864649162b557"}}, "hash": "8c784c9cd7c27caf226211f19676fe342ac3cd5afe040e0aee591aae901036a9", "text": "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 17 Chronic Wrist Pain  \u2022 For patients with suspected Kienb\u00f6ck\u2019s disease without radiographic confirmation, MRI without IV contrast \nis usually appropriate.  \n\u2022 For patients with radiographic evidence of Kienb\u00f6ck\u2019s disease, further imaging is usually not necessary.

A wide variety  of pathological  entities  may cause hip pain, \nincluding  osseous  as well as intra- or extra -articular  soft tissue abnormalities  [5-7]. Pathology  involving  the lumbar  \nspine,  sacroiliac,  or knee  joints  can also cause hip pain [8], and these  etiologies  should  be investigated  as needed . \nThere is limited  original  research  that specifically  targets the imaging  of chronic  hip pain,  but imaging  of specific  \nconditions  is widely  discussed  in the published  literature. \nBefore  imaging,  an appropriate  assessment  of a patient\u2019s  clinical  history  and physical  examination  is essential  in \ntrying  to pare down the range  of possible etiologies  for a patient\u2019s  symptoms.  Important  historical  details  include  \nsymptom  duration,  pain patterns (eg, activity  or inactivity  related,  symptomatic  worsening  at night  or in the \nmorning),  alleviating  or exacerbating  factors,  and a sensation  of locking or snapping.  On physical  examination,  \nassessing  a patient\u2019s  range  of motion,  gait, and pain level  using a variety  of provocative  maneuvers is usually  \nperformed . Following  a history and physical  examination,  targeted  imaging  can play a vital role in distinguishing  \nthe etiologies  of a patient\u2019s  symptoms,  thus allowing  appropriate  treatment  of the patient\u2019s  underlying condition . \nBone  tumors \u2014both malignant  and benign\u2014may  be identified  as part of the initial diagnostic  evaluation  of a patient  \npresenting  with chronic  hip pain.  A detailed  discussion  of the appropriate  imaging  workup  of primary  bone  tumors  \nis covered  in the ACR  Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae topic  on \u201cPrimary  Bone  Tumors \u201d [9].

However,  increased  radiotracer  uptake  is a nonspecific  finding,  and, \noverall,  there is insufficient  literature  to support  the use of fluoride  PET/CT skull base to mid-thigh in the evaluation  \nof chronic  hip pain thought  to be due to hip impingement  and/or  dysplasia.  \nImage -Guided Anesthetic +/- Corticosteroid  Injection  Hip Joint  or Surrounding  Structures  \nFluoroscopic -, CT-, or US-guided anesthetic and/or  corticosteroid  injections  can be a useful  tool for clarifying  the \nsource of a patient\u2019s  chronic  hip pain.

MR arthrography has been  shown to have  a sensitivity  of 94.5%  and a specificity  of 100%  for \nthe detection  of labral  tears  [52], which  may be associated  with FAI. Some  authors  have  shown  that MRI without  \nIV contrast  and MR arthrography are similarly  accurate and sensitive for detecting  labral  tears in the setting  of FAI \n[53], and other  authors  have  shown  that MR arthrography is superior  to conven tional MRI  [54,55] . Several  \npublications  show  that MR arthrography is superior  to CT arthrography  and noncontrast  MRI for evaluation  of \nlabral  tears  [18,56] , but there  are other  publications  that demonstrate that CT arthrography and noncontrast  MRI are \nsuperior  [16,57-59] . MR arthrography  may also nicely  demonstrate acetabular  chondral  delamination  [60]. \nAlthough MR arthrography can be useful  for demonstrating labral  and chondral  pathology  associated  with \nimpingement,  the presence of intra-articular  contrast  offers  no advantage over noncontrast  MRI for the detection  of \nextra-articular  abnormalities  associated  with impingement.  \nMRI Hip Without and With  IV Contrast  \nIndirect  arthrography  is a technique  that falls under  the category  of MRI hip with contrast.  When  administered  \nintravenously,  gadolinium  chelate contrast  can diffuse  into the joint space via the synovium , and this results in \nindirect  arthrography.

A noncontrast  MRI  can demonstrate  findings  of extra-articular  impingement  as well.

The diagnostic  accuracy  of indirect  \nMR arthrography has not been  widely  studied  [96], and, as such,  there is insufficient literature  to support  the use of \nMRI with IV contrast in assessment  for the degree of cartilage damage.  IV contrast  administration  can; however,  \nhelp to demonstrate the degree  of enhancing inflamed  synovium . Delayed  gadolinium -enhanced  MRI of cartilage  \nmay be useful  in assessing  the degree of hip cartilage damage,  but this is most  frequently employed in the research  \nsetting  [97]. Overall,  given the scant  literature  supporting indirect  arthrography,  this is a technique  that is not often  \nused clinically.  \nMRI Hip Without IV Contrast  \nDirect  visualization  of articular  cartilage is possible  on MRI because of its intrinsic  excellent  soft tissue contrast  \nresolution  [89]. MRI can demonstrate the articular  cartilage  and areas of chondral  pathology  [18,91,93] . MRI has \nbeen  shown  to be 85.92 % accurate for identification  of acetabular  chondral  rim lesions when  compared  to \narthroscopy [85]. Various MRI techniques  such as T2 mapping,  T1rho , and sodium  imaging  allow  for the \nultrastructural  assessment  of articular  cartilage [98]. Although these  techniques  are primarily  used in the research  \nsetting , some  have  also been  applied  in the routine  evaluation  of clinical  patients.  \nUS Hip \nUS is limited  in the hip by its inability  to evaluate the acetabular  or the majority  of the femoral  head  cartilage.

Kransdorf, MD.q \nSummary of Literature Review  \nBackground/Introduction \nChronic knee pain affects tens of millions of people  in the United States annually , with the pain sometimes highly \ndisabling and often negatively impacting the patient\u2019s quality of life. Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and \nit can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain \nwith the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. \nTypically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain \npersists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  \nimaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated \nthat approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the \nprior year) radiographs [2 ]. \nThis document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  \u22655 years of age.  The \nvariants discussed include: (1) initial exam ination ; (2) initial radiograph is normal or demonstrates a joint \neffusion; (3) initial radiogr aph demonstrates osteochondritis dissecans (OCD), loose bodies or history of cartilage,  \nor meniscal repair; (4) initial radiograph demonstrates osteoarthritis or chondrocalcinosis; and (5)  initial \nradiograph demonstrates signs of prior (chronic) knee injur y (ie, Segond fract ure, tibial spine avulsion, etc ).  \nTo evaluat e knee pain associated with other conditions, please refer to the following ACR Appropriateness \nCriteria\u00ae topic on:  \u201cOsteonecrosi s of the Hip \u201d [3] for osteonecrosis,  \u201cAcute Trauma to the Knee \u201d for acute knee \ninjuries  [4], \u201cImaging After Total Knee Arthroplasty \u201d for patients with total knee arthroplasty  [5], \u201cSoft-Tissue \nMasses \u201d for a patient with a suspected soft -tissue mass [6], \u201cPrimary Bone Tumors \u201d for a patient with a suspected \nor known bone tumor [ 7], and \u201c Chronic Extremity Joint Pain -Suspected Inflammatory Arthritis \u201d for patient with \nsuspected arthritis  or synovitis [ 8]. \nSpecial Imaging  Considerations  \nKnee radiographs  should include at least one frontal projection of one or both knees (anteroposterior, Rosenberg, \nor tunnel), a tangential patellar view , and a lateral view of the affected knee [2,9]. Standing radiographs more \naccurately reflect medial and lateral compartment cartilage loss than supine radiographs with the posteromedial and posterolateral joint compartments  more accurately assessed using a weight -bearing flexion posteroanterior \nradiograph [9,10]. \nDiscussion of Pro cedures by Variant  \nVariant 1:  Adult or child greater than or equal to 5  year s of age .

When a severe \nvarus or valgus deformity is present, significant cartilage loss in the apparently \u201cwider\u201d compartment may not be \nevident  [11,12]. Conversely, joint space narrowing may be caused by meniscal extrusion or degeneration rather \nthan cartilage loss [11].  \nChronic knee pain is associated with the radiographic demonstration of osteophytes with the development of a \n\u201cbone -on-bone\u201d appearance or complete joint space loss on sub sequent radiographs indicating disease progression \nand potentially indicating the need for arthroplasty [11-13].  \nRadiography Hip \nAn ipsilateral hip radiograph is usually not indicated as a first imaging examination . \nCT Knee  \nCT is usually not indicated as a first imaging examination.  \nCT Arthrography  Knee  \nCT arthrography is usually not indicated as a first imaging examination.  \nMRI Knee  \nMRI is usually not indicated as  a first imaging examination .

CT can also be used to \nevaluate trochlear morphology and the t ibial tubercle-t rochlear groove distance.

Subchondral cysts, articular cartilage,  and meniscal abnormalities are easily detected on MRI [13,18,19]. \nHowever, meniscal tears are often incidental findings in older patients with the majority of people over 70 years", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "876863c5-d711-4578-ade4-c66546808bef": {"__data__": {"id_": "876863c5-d711-4578-ade4-c66546808bef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "ACR chronic knee pain.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "52491a44-c19a-44b1-8094-e9f9ea30edf8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "ACR chronic knee pain.pdf"}, "hash": "95de69e5df1295fd3a5175ef397275e3928554408bd823b48f7113502ebc4379"}, "3": {"node_id": "02859c80-4c42-4954-94ea-5ef7a7932df8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "ACR chronic knee pain.pdf"}, "hash": "0f475ab23216fa62fd09de1c6a50cfe22a5420c4c7a0bd38e2b6008f3eaf181e"}}, "hash": "8fedf218a12bedf46d2e63e14bbd48dc0393c250b3df41a90057bbd8dae44919", "text": "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 6 Chronic Knee Pain  of age having an asymptomatic meniscal tear , and the likelihood of a meniscal tear being present in either a \npainful or asymptomatic knee not significantly different in patients 45 to 55 years of age [20,21]. \nBone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the \nsubchondral bone.  New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or \npatients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee \npain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the \norigin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. \nSubchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed \nspontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to \nelderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs \noften initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, \nand progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is \nsuspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria\n\u00ae \ntopic on \u201c Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae \u201d [28]. \nSome patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using \nquantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs \nexhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ]. \nPatellofemoral car tilage loss is also associated with chronic knee pain , with active knee pain correlated with \nBMLs [30,31]. Similar to CT, MRI can calculate various anatomic measurements associated with patellofemoral \nsubluxation/dislocation and lateral patellofemoral friction syndrome [32-34]. Bone marrow edema in the classic \nlocation for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also \ndifferentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise \ntherapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. \nOther etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat \npad impingement syndromes, Hoffa\u2019s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome, adhesive \ncapsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes , \nand osteonecrosis [15, 19,36-45].  \nMRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a \njoint effusion. However, contrast -enhanced images ma y be more accurate in diagnosing other causes of chronic \nknee pain , such as Hoffa\u2019s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome, and adhesive \ncapsulitis [15].  In particular, enh ancing synovitis thicker than 2 mm in Hoffa\u2019s fat is correlated with peripatellar \npain [46]. Contrast -enhanced MRI is also useful in quantifying the degree of synovitis and in evaluating \nconditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis [ 17,42,47,48].  \nMR Arthrography  Knee  \nMR arthrography performed with an intra -articular injection of dilute gadolinium solution is typically not \nindicated as a second exam ination  but rather reserved for patients with known prior meniscal surgery, chondral \nand osteochondral lesions , and suspected loose bodies  [10].", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "02859c80-4c42-4954-94ea-5ef7a7932df8": {"__data__": {"id_": "02859c80-4c42-4954-94ea-5ef7a7932df8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "ACR chronic knee pain.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "52491a44-c19a-44b1-8094-e9f9ea30edf8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "ACR chronic knee pain.pdf"}, "hash": "95de69e5df1295fd3a5175ef397275e3928554408bd823b48f7113502ebc4379"}, "2": {"node_id": "876863c5-d711-4578-ade4-c66546808bef", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "ACR chronic knee pain.pdf"}, "hash": "8fedf218a12bedf46d2e63e14bbd48dc0393c250b3df41a90057bbd8dae44919"}}, "hash": "0f475ab23216fa62fd09de1c6a50cfe22a5420c4c7a0bd38e2b6008f3eaf181e", "text": "MR Arthrography  Knee  \nMR arthrography performed with an intra -articular injection of dilute gadolinium solution is typically not \nindicated as a second exam ination  but rather reserved for patients with known prior meniscal surgery, chondral \nand osteochondral lesions , and suspected loose bodies  [10].  \nUS Knee  \nUS is not often useful as a screening test or a comprehensive examination.

Following cartilage repair, MRI can grade the repair site and even guide the retrograde drilling \nof the OCD l esion [51-54] . \nMRI with and without IV contrast is not usually indicated  to evaluate patients with OCD, loose bodies,  or history \nof cartilage repair because of the  usual larger volume of joint fluid, the lesser degree of synovial invagination,  and \nthe longer time required to achieve steady state gadolinium in the joint compared to the shoulder [16].  \nMR Arthrography  Knee  \nMR arthrography is typically  reserved for patients with known prior meniscal surgery, chondral and \nosteochondral lesions, prior cartilage repair procedures, or suspected loose bodies [10, 16]. \nUS Knee  \nUS is not often useful as a screening test or a comprehensive examination.  It may be appropriate to localize \nsuspected loose bodies, especially if the loose bodies might be within a popliteal cyst , lateral recess, or \nsuprapatellar recess.  \nBone Scan Knee  \nRadionuclide bone scan is usually not indicated to evaluate patients with OCD, loose bodies,  or history of \ncartilage repair.  \nImage -Guided Aspiration Knee  \nJoint aspiration is usually not indicated to evaluate patients with OCD, loose bodies,  or history of cartilage repair.  \nVariant 4: Adult or child greater than or equal to 5 years of age .

Limited CT without IV contrast can be used for surgical planning.  \nCT Arthrography  Knee  \nCT arthrography is not commonly utilized as a second test in pati ents with arthritis even though CT is the most \naccurate method for evaluating cartilage abnormalities extending to the articular surface that is  due to the high \nspatial resolution between the contrast and the cartilage [11].  \nMRI Knee  \nMRI without IV contrast is not usually indicated in patients for whom radiographs are diagnostic of osteoarthritis \nunless symptoms are not explained by the radiographic findings (eg, s tress fractures) or the appropriate treatment \noption requires additional imaging [11, 19]. \nGiven the increased sensitivity of MRI for osteoarthritis, MRI may be indicated when more accurate or serial \ncartilage measurements are desired [10 ,55,56]. In patients >70 years of age, a higher correlation with the \n\u201cabnormal\u201d knee being painful is present when structural abnormalities are unilateral on either radiographs or \nMRI. S ince bilateral structural abnormalities can be present with primarily unilateral symptoms, the ability to \ndiscriminate painful from nonpainful knees is limited [57] . This persists even when using the MRI presence of \nsynovitis or effusion and/or a Kellgren and Lawrence score of \u2265 2; findings were reported to be the best \ndiscriminators between painful and asymptomatic knees [19].  \nPatellofemoral cartilage loss is closely associated with chronic knee pain with active knee pain correlated with BMLs [56]. Since MRI is more accurate than physical examination in identifying severe grades of \nchondromalacia patellae, it may be an appropriate screening tool prior to arthroscopy [58 ]. \nMRI with and without IV contrast is indicated when performing semiquantitative assessment of knee \nosteoarthritis using various scoring systems to include cartilage, synovitis, ligaments, BMLs , and menisci [18].  In \nobese patients with osteoarthritis on contrast -enhanced images, increased perfusion in Hoffa\u2019s fat is associated \nwith more severe anterior knee pain [59 ].  \nMR Arthrography  Knee  \nMR arthrography is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with osteoarthritis or chondrocalcinosis.  \nUS Knee  \nUS is not often useful as a screening test or a comprehensive examination.  US can detect synovial pathology, \neffusions , and cortical erosive changes [11]. Power Doppler US  can demonstrate increased synovial blood flow \nthat is associated with knee pain and can demonstrat e reduced blood flow , which correlates with reduced knee \npain following joint injections [60]. US can also demonstrate meniscal extrusion , a finding th at suggests an \nunderlying meniscal tear , and , on occasion , chondrocalcinosis and peripheral meniscal tears [11].  \nBone Scan Knee  \nRadionuclide bone scan  is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with chronic knee pain given the low \nspecificity and decreased anatomic resolution compared to CT or MRI [11].  However, i t may help distinguish \nbetween bone and soft -tissue origins for pain as well as localize pain to one or more joints [11].  \nImage -Guided Aspiration Knee  \nIf an effusion is present, US - or fluoroscopically guided joint aspiration can be performed for synovial fluid \nanalysis if there is concern for crystal disease or infection.

Because there is a w ide range of radiation exposures associated with \ndifferent diagnostic procedures, a relative radiation level (RRL) indication has been included for each imaging examination. The RRLs are based on effective dose, which is a radiation dose quantity that is u sed to estimate \npopulation total radiation risk associated with an imaging procedure. Patients in the pediatric age group are at \ninherently higher risk from exposure, both because of organ sensitivity and longer life expectancy (relevant to the \nlong latenc y that appears to accompany radiation exposure). For these reasons, the RRL dose estimate ranges for \npediatric examinations are lower as compared to those specified for adults (see Table below).

Chang, MD.o \nSummary  of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nChronic  shoulder  pain lasting  >6 months  is a common  presenting  complaint , particularly  in patients  \u226540 years of \nage [1]. Along with a thorough history and physical  examination,  imaging  plays  a critical  role in determining the \nsource of chronic  shoul der pain.  Common pain generators in the shoulder  include  the rotator  cuff tendons,  biceps \ntendon,  labrum,  glenohumeral  articular  cartilage,  acromioclavicular  joint, bones,  suprascapular  and axillary  nerves,  \nand the joint capsule/synovium.  Imaging  can help to guide  appropriate  therapy , which  can range  from  conservative  \nmeasures such as physical  therapy  and cortico steroid  injections  to more  invasive  procedures  such as arthroscopy or \nsurgery . This document  focuses on the imaging approach  to patients  with suspected  chronic  mechanical  shoulder  \npain. See the separate ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae topics  on \u201cChronic  Extremity  Joint  Pain-Suspected  \nInflammatory  Arthritis \u201d [2], \u201cImaging After  Shoulder  Arthroplasty \u201d [3], \u201cPrimary  Bone  Tumors \u201d [4], \u201cSoft-Tissue \nMasses \u201d [5], and \u201cShoulder  Pain-Traumatic \u201d [6] if further guidance  is needed  for potential alternative  causes of \nshoulder  pain.  \nSpecial Imaging  Considerations   \nSeveral  studies have  looked for ways to shorten  typical  shoulder  conventional  MRI or MR arthrogram  protocols  \nwhile  maintaining  diagnostic  accuracy.  Isotropic  3-D imaging has been  increasingly  used as a substitute  for \nconventional  multiplanar  2-D MRI,  with a similar  sensitivity  and specificity  for rotator  cuff tear and labral  \nabnormalities  at a lower  scan time [7,8] . Faster  scans can also be performed  using 2-D fast spin echo  sequences  \nwith parallel  imaging , which  produce  similar  findings  as seen on conventional  MRI [9]. \nInitial Imaging  Definition \nInitial imaging  is defined  as imaging  at the beginning of the care episode for the medical  condition defined  by the \nvariant.  More  than one procedure  can be considered  usually  appropriate  in the initial imaging  evaluation  when : \n\u2022 There are procedures  that are equivalent  alternatives (ie, only one procedure  will be ordered  to \nprovide  the clinical  information  to effectively  manage the patient\u2019s  care)  \nOR \n\u2022 There are complementary  procedures  (ie, more  than one procedure  is ordered  as a set or \nsimultaneously  where each procedure  provides  unique  clinical  information  to effectively  manage  \nthe patient\u2019s  care).  \n \naPanel Vice- chair, University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, Virginia. bPanel Chair, Mayo Clinic Arizona, Phoenix, Arizona. cUniversity of \nWisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin. dStanford University, Stanford, California, Primary care physician. eMayo Clinic, \nRochester, Minnesota. fHospital for Special Surgery, New York, New York.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "60fb89a1-40f5-420f-a520-25591acb6028": {"__data__": {"id_": "60fb89a1-40f5-420f-a520-25591acb6028", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "ACR chronic shoulder pain.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7950aa9c-4725-4418-a76d-053bad8f5763", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "ACR chronic shoulder pain.pdf"}, "hash": "9dff54c8086c1aa5791093e6e41fa75c995ade0f1fd477c3a5a2fa5de69e145c"}, "2": {"node_id": "11b34d75-7fca-4631-930c-a5ad7a0f1021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "ACR chronic shoulder pain.pdf"}, "hash": "8c7b0deb88f835ea1603dacde1f65b15fcad7b40e24a088150c815d2369fe1ce"}}, "hash": "c9d3523967866286fcfe4c1d50a91af6f3098d615d5f9d5779202a2897da65f3", "text": "aPanel Vice- chair, University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, Virginia. bPanel Chair, Mayo Clinic Arizona, Phoenix, Arizona. cUniversity of \nWisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin. dStanford University, Stanford, California, Primary care physician. eMayo Clinic, \nRochester, Minnesota. fHospital for Special Surgery, New York, New York. gUniversity of Nebr aska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska; American College \nof Emergency Physicians. hThe Centers for Advanced Orthopaedics, George Washington University, Washington, District of Columbia; American Academy \nof Orthopaedic Surgeons. iUniversity of Michigan Health  System, Ann Arbor, Michigan; Committee on Emergency Radiology -GSER. jDuke University \nMedical Center, Durham, North Carolina. kUniversity of Missouri Health Care, Columbia, Missouri. lCleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio. mThe University of \nTexas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas; Commission on Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging. nPenn State Milton S.

Radiographs  can evaluate for unexpected  fracture,  unsuspected  \naggressive bony lesion,  osteoarthritis, inflammatory  arthropathy,  osteonecrosis,  or calcium  hydroxyapatite  \ndeposition.  Accurate  interpretation  of radiographs  can often  obviate  additional  imaging  or be complementary  to \nsubsequent  imaging studie s. A high-riding  humeral  head  on radiographs  is highly associated  with chronic  rotator  \ncuff tear [11], particularly  if seen in combination with sclerosis of the inferior acromion,  greater  tuberosity  cysts,  a \nlateral  acromial  spur, and cortical  irregularity  or sclerosis of the greater  tuberosity  [12-14]. \nUS Shoulder  \nThe literature  suggests that radiographic  evaluation  should  generally  be the first imaging  study  ordered  in patients  \nwith shoulder  pain [1,10-14] . Some practitioners  may use ultrasound (US) as an initial imaging  study when  rotator  \ncuff disease/impingement  is suggested  by the clinical  exam ination .", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "70526fb6-17e3-474a-8b31-4ea6b9c43a09": {"__data__": {"id_": "70526fb6-17e3-474a-8b31-4ea6b9c43a09", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "ACR chronic shoulder pain.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fb85c95d-302a-4fd8-aa97-a9c388be060b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "ACR chronic shoulder pain.pdf"}, "hash": "5ed2dc4c79ee9c4bf9ebab61eae3092c9adf91114210a10b10f2c3067afa0467"}, "3": {"node_id": "dc2a527f-1d3c-4c0c-aba0-a0d40808d2a3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "ACR chronic shoulder pain.pdf"}, "hash": "ce2dd286c651fcd45ec42b1c524136c1663bb07ad8f86e3274ca8ce1fff6a933"}}, "hash": "1075472a1f37ef4c2f233161385ff184f861062e3c6f7ea942ec2445b5069af0", "text": "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 7 Chronic Shoulder Pain  Variant  2: Chronic  shoulder  pain.

Next  imaging  study.  \nBone  Scan  Shoulder  \nThere is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of bone  scan shoulder  in the evaluation  of chronic  shoulder  pain \nwhen  rotator  cuff disorder  or subacromial  subdeltoid bursitis  is suspected . \nCT Arthrography  Shoulder  \nCT arthrography  has shown  good diagnostic  performance for depicting  rotator  cuff tendon  tears with a reported  \nrespective sensitivity  and specificity  of 99% and 100%  for the supraspinatus  tendon,  97.4%  and 99.5%  for the \ninfraspinatus  tendon,  and 64.7%  and 98.2%  for the subscapularis tendon  [15]. CT arthrography provides  a \ncomparable alternative  to MR arthrography in the evaluation  of rotator  cuff tendon tears [16,17] . CT arthrography \nis able to detect  very subtle  articular  surface cuff defects,  but, because of lack of contrast  extension  from  the \nglenohumeral  joint space,  it is less effective at demonstrating bursal  surface or intrasubstance tears,  which  are \ntypically  well seen with MRI or US [18]. \nCT Shoulder  With  IV Contrast  \nThere is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of CT shoulder  with IV contrast  in the evaluation  of chronic  \nshoulder  pain when  rotator  cuff disorder  or subacromial  subdeltoid bursitis  is suspected.  \nCT Shoulder  Without  and With  IV Contrast  \nThere is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of CT shoulder  without  and with IV contrast  in the evaluation  of \nchronic  shoulder  pain when  rotator  cuff disorder  or subacromial  subdeltoid  bursitis  is suspected.  \nCT Shoulder  Without  IV Contrast  \nCT shoulder  without  IV contrast  is of limited  utility  when  evaluating  for rotator  cuff tear or subacromial  subdeltoid  \nbursitis. Noncontrast  CT can sometimes  demonstrate fatty infiltration  of rotator  cuff muscles with a corresponding \nrotator  cuff tear, although  the overall  sensitivity  of this finding  is low [19]. CT may demonstrate a high-riding  \nhumeral  head  or remodeling  of the acromial  undersurface in patients  with large  rotator  cuff tears.

Indirect  MR arthrography has been  shown  to have  a slightly  higher  specificity  for diagnosing articular -\nsurface partial thickness tears  of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus  tendons,  as well as a greater  specificity  for \ndiagnosing subscapularis tendon tears [35], relative  to noncontrast  MRI,  and has shown  high accuracy  relative  to \narthroscopy [36]. Although the accuracy  of indirect  MR arthrography has been  descr ibed in the literature, it is not \ncommonly used in clinical  practice.  \nMRI Shoulder  Without  IV Contrast  \nMRI of the shoulder  is a highly  accurate tool in the assessment  of the rotator  cuff.

Rotator  cuff tears,  particularly  full thickness  \ntears,  can be reliably  identified  using conventional  MRI  with high sensitivity  and specificity  [37-39]. Sensitivity  \nand specificity  for detecting  partial  thickness bursal  surface  tears is similar  for conventional  MRI and MR \narthrography  [27]. Although MR arthrography may have  a slightly  higher  sensitivity  and specificity  than \nconventional  MRI for diagnosing  rotator  cuff tears,  particularly  partial  thickness articular  surface tears,  this \ndifference in accuracy  must  be weighed  against  the need  for an invasive  arthrogram  procedure  [29]. Tendon \nretraction,  muscle atrophy,  and fatty infiltration  are associated  important  findings  that are well seen on MRI  and \npredict  reparability  of rotator  cuff tear [40]. Axial  images  can be helpful  in determining  rotator  cuff tear shape  [41], \nwhich  can aid in the selection  of a particular  surgical  technique.

Although diagnosing recurrent  labral  \ntears after prior  labral  repair  is challenging,  MR arthrography is particularly  helpful  in this scenario  in which discrete  \nfluid  or gadolinium  signal  within  or underlying  the labrum,  absent  labrum,  and paralabral  cyst are all highly  \nsuggestive  of recurrent  tear [94], with a greater  sensitivity  than seen with conventional  MRI [73]. \nMRI Shoulder  Without  and With  IV Contrast  \nIV injection  of gadolinium  can be used to enhance the highly vascular  synovium  producing an indirect  arthrogram  \neffect  [34]. Indirect  arthrography has been  found to have  a sensitivity  of 74% and a specificity  of 67% for SLAP \ntear, which is lower  than for direct  MR arthrography [89].

MR arthrogra phy adds additional  benefit  to conventional  \nshoulder  MRI  because it may identify  some  labral  tears that are not seen with conventional  MRI  [95]. The increased  \naccuracy  with MR arthrog raphy should be balanced  against  the need  for an invasive  arthrogram  procedure.  \nAlthough evaluation  of glenoid bony integrity  is typically  better  with CT imaging,  some  practitioners have  used \nultrashort  or zero echo  time sequences [96-98], 3-D sequences  [99], or conventional  MRI  sequences  [100]  to \nmeasure glenoid bone  loss with a high concordance  to CT images.  \nRadiography Shoulder  Additional Views  \nThere are several  options  for additional  radiographic  views in patients  with suspected  instability  [1]. The West  Point  \nand Garth  views can demonstrate the anterior  inferior glenoid at a better  advantage  in patients  with a suspected  \nBankart  fracture.  A Stryker  notch  view can sometimes demonstrate  a Hill-Sachs lesion  that is difficult  to see on \nconventional  projections.

Kransdorf,  MD.n \nSummary  of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nThere has been  a rapid  increase  in the number  of shoulder  arthroplasties,  including  partial  or complete humeral  head  \nresurfacing,  hemiarthroplasty,  total shoulder  arthroplasty,  and reverse total shoulder  arthroplasty,  performed  in the \nUnited  States  over the past 2 decades [1]. The most  recent  published estimates have  reported  a 2.5-fold  increase in \nthe number  of shoulder  arthroplasties performed  between  1998 and 2008,  from  19,000 to 47,000 [1,2] . Overall,  \ntotal shoulder  arthroplasties are the most  common  type,  having surpassed  hemiarthroplasties in the last decade [1]. \nMost  shoulder  arthroplasties are performed  for degenerative  conditions.  Humeral  head  resurfacing  is indicated  in \npatients  with humeral  head  osteonecrosis,  large Hill-Sachs deformity,  or focal  osteoarthrosis.  Hemiarthroplasties  \nare typically  performed  in patients  with osteoarthrosis limited  to the humeral  head  or in patients  with comminuted  \nhumeral  head  fractures.  Hemiarthroplasties are also recommended  in patients  with deficient  glenoid bone  stock  and \nin patients  with greater  preoperative  comorbidities  because they require  a shorter  intraoperative  time compared  with \ntotal shoulder  arthroplasty.  Presently,  total shoulder  arthroplasty  is recommended  over hemiarthroplasty  for \nadvanced  shoulder  osteoarthrosis because of its superior  clinical  outcome.  \nReverse shoulder  arthroplasties  were first introduced in 1987  as a treatment  option for patients  with a deficient  \nrotator  cuff and have  been  used as a salvage procedure  for patients  with failed  total shoulder  arthroplasties [3,4] . \nReverse  shoulder  arthroplasties are constructed  differently  from  total shoulder  arthroplasties to compensate  for the \nlack of stabilization  related  to the deficient  rotator  cuff. The glenoid  component  is a round  metal  ball (referred  to as \nthe glenosphere)  attached  to a baseplate along the glenoid surface,  and the humeral  component  has a cup-shaped  \narticular  margin  secured  by a metal  stem  [4]. The construct  moves  the center  of rotation  medial  and distal, which  \nallows the deltoid  muscle to serve as a main  stabilizer  of the arthroplasty  and joint [4]. Additionally,  the more  \nmedial  and distal  center  of rotation  decreases the risk of glenoid loosening [4,5] . \nThe complication  rate for shoulder  arthroplasties has been  reported  to be as high as 39.8%,  with revision  rates up \nto 11% [6].", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e1359967-60eb-4616-99b9-76ef465256b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "e1359967-60eb-4616-99b9-76ef465256b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "ACR imaging after shoulder arthroplasty.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2b9eac8e-fa72-42c1-8ef1-7c934bbd3bdb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "ACR imaging after shoulder arthroplasty.pdf"}, "hash": "b5b29ffdf64fbdc05a2170c7f9e646de230d783b22facaae9195c26e8b1de45f"}, "2": {"node_id": "cba526a5-d0cc-4bb0-b447-fc87ad6e1821", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "ACR imaging after shoulder arthroplasty.pdf"}, "hash": "dbd8edb740cb03be94b8a6899f2261cb04efe799c58bd7aae1ddec29c5f14917"}}, "hash": "142dfbaefd7a300d52af69370b3dc1c56104833a8aeaa602ee1dd7979f0547d2", "text": "The construct  moves  the center  of rotation  medial  and distal, which  \nallows the deltoid  muscle to serve as a main  stabilizer  of the arthroplasty  and joint [4].

The most  common  complication  for hemiarthroplasties has been  erosion  of the unresurfaced  \nglenoid (20.6%),  whereas glenoid loosening (14.3%)  has been  reported  as the most  common  complication  for total \nshoulder  arthroplasties [6]. The rate of perioperative  complications, such as blood loss, thromboembolism,  and \nimmediate  postoperative  infection, has been  shown  to be similar  for both types  of surgeries [7]. The most  common  \ncomplications  associated  with reverse total shoulder  arthroplasties  are scapular  notching,  dislocation,  periprosthetic  \nfractures,  glenoid baseplate failure,  and acromial  fractures [8,9] . \nSymptoms  relate d to postoperative  difficulties  include  activity -related  pain,  decreased  range  of motion,  and \napprehension.

The selection  of the next imaging  modality  depends  on several  \nfactors,  including  findings  on the initial  imaging study,  clinical  suspicion  of an osseous versus soft-tissue injury,  or \nclinical  suspicion  of infection.  \nSpecial Imaging  Considerations  \nArthrography  \nArthrography , using only radiographic  or fluoroscopic  images,  had previously been  utilized  for detecting  rotator  \ncuff tears in the setting  of shoulder  arthroplasty . Because of  its inability  to assess muscle  quality, gradation of partial  \ntearing,  and differentiate  between  the torn rotator  cuff tendons,  conventional  radiographic  arthrography  has mostly  \nbeen  supplanted by cross-sectional  imaging  techniques such as CT arthrography,  MR arthrography,  and ultrasound  \n(US).  \nNuclear Medicine  \nThe use of nuclear  medicine in the evaluation  of complications  after arthroplasty  has been  limited  to the evaluation  \nof hip and knee  arthroplasties.  Because of  limited  literature  on shoulder  arthroplasties,  these same  physiologic  \nprinciples  can be applied  to shoulder  arthroplasties,  and radionuclide  imaging  is not limited  by metallic  hardware  \n[11]. \nTc-99m -methylene diphosphonate  (MDP)  bone  scans are useful  in assessing  shoulder  arthroplasties,  especially  with \nnormal  radiographs  and persistent  concern  for aseptic loosening,  osteomyelitis, or periprosthetic  fractures.  \nUnfortunately,  the specificity  of bone  scans is low, and new bone  formation  can also be seen in normal  or abnormal  \npostoperative  bony remodeling and neuropathic  arthropathy  in addition  to acute fractures,  periprosthetic  infection, \nor aseptic prosthetic  loosening.  \nTypical  bone  scans are either  a single  or a 3-phase study.  The standard  single -phase bone  scan involves  imaging  2 \nto 3 hours  after MDP  administration. The 3-phase bone  scan consists of a 1-minute  radionuclide  angiogram  followed  \nby immediate  blood pool images and 2- to 3-hour  delayed  views.  The 3-phase scan can be helpful  in the assessment  \nof acute fracture  and differentiating  acute osteomyelitis  from  cellulitis. \nA positive  3-phase bone  scan is often  seen in neuropathic  arthropathy.  The use of radiolabeled  white  blood  cells \n(WBC) with In-111 in conjunction with bone  marrow  imaging,  utilizing  Tc-99m  sulfur  colloid,  can help to \ndifferentiate  neuropathic  reactive bone  marrow  from  acute osteomyelitis. Serial bone  scans can also assist  in \nassessing  postoperative  bone  remodeling and periprosthetic  fracture from  aseptic periprosthetic  loosening.  \nThe value  of WBC and marrow  imaging  is not only to differentiate  neuropathic  arthropathy from  acute osteomyelitis  \nbut also to differentiate  aseptic  loosening from  acute osteomyelitis. Like neuropathic  arthropathy,  aseptic loosening  \nwill demonstrate spatially  congruent  WBC  and marrow  activity, consistent  with reactive or hematopoietically  active  \nmarrow.   \nHowever,  in acute osteomyelitis , In-111- labeled  WBCs  will accumulate,  and the marrow  uptake  will be suppressed,  \nresulting  in photopenia  on sulfur  colloid  marrow  scan, which  is spatially  incongruent  with the WBC activity.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "109fac1f-75a4-49bb-8554-5e939d4bfcf0": {"__data__": {"id_": "109fac1f-75a4-49bb-8554-5e939d4bfcf0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "ACR imaging after shoulder arthroplasty.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "14152568-5dd2-41a3-ae5e-0568500c06d8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "ACR imaging after shoulder arthroplasty.pdf"}, "hash": "18afb19661b8cdc287e4b97a78014e543c634c72a9300a9d906d4f5541361d60"}, "2": {"node_id": "7b1eb44f-219c-4492-b078-546db9bea532", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "ACR imaging after shoulder arthroplasty.pdf"}, "hash": "5105dd2f7f00d890a1f62d5f6687def149bc40360c43a89cd43f9d8bcd7c1961"}}, "hash": "dd5bda848013fd30fadbc1992e8bf25c85c3db63c707cd427261e9b9e1dbf2a6", "text": "However,  in acute osteomyelitis , In-111- labeled  WBCs  will accumulate,  and the marrow  uptake  will be suppressed,  \nresulting  in photopenia  on sulfur  colloid  marrow  scan, which  is spatially  incongruent  with the WBC activity.

These may include  anterior -posterior,  anterior -posterior  Grashey,  scapular  Y, and axillary  \nviews [10,13] . Intraoperative  and immediate  postoperative  radiographs  are also ordered  by some  surgeons,  but their \nbenefit , without a specific indication,  has been  questioned  because of  limitations  inherent  to the portable  nature  of \nthe exam ination , patients\u2019  difficulties  in cooperating with the various  views,  and low impact  on overall  patient  care \n[14]. The frequency  of follow -up radiographs  varies depending  on the surgeon\u2019s  preference but usually  accompanies  \ntheir follow -up visits  anywhere  between  3 months  and 1 year postsurgery . The routine  use of radiographic  imaging  \nin the first postoperative  year in asymptomatic patients  has been  called  into question  in a 2017 assessment  [15]. \nRadiographs  are also typically  ordered  for yearly  follow -up examinations  to assess interval  changes  in the bone  \nsurrounding the prosthesis  [16]. The presence  of scapular  notching on postoperative  radiographs  of reverse total \nshoulder  prostheses has been  associated  with poor clinical  outcomes  [17]. The risk for loosening  increases over \ntime, with notable  radiographic  changes associated  with loosening found at least 5 years after surgery,  most  \ncommonly involving  the glenoid component  [18]. Late complications  requiring  revision  surgery,  such as loosening,  \ninfection, and fracture,  occurring up to 15 years postoperatively , suggests the need  for long-term  radiographic  \nfollow -up when  these complications  are asymptomatic or their outcome  can be affected  by early  detection  on \nradiographs  [10]. \nUS Shoulder  \nUS examinations  are not typically  ordered  for evaluation  of the asymptomatic patient. \nVariant  2: Symptomatic  patient  with  a primary  shoulder  arthroplasty .

Advanced \nmetal reduction techniques can reduce the prosthesis-related arti fact and thus improve visualization of the rotator \ncuff tendons and any associated pathology [37,38] . Compared with the other imaging techniques, MRI can also \nprovide a more global evaluation of the arthroplasty components as well as the surrounding soft  tissues [37,38] . \nMRI with metal reduction techniques can also demonstrate failure of subscapularis tendon repair in the setting of \narthroplasty,  the most common location for rotator cuff pathology in this setting [38]. \nThere are multiple techniques used to release the subscapularis tendon during arthroplasty placement, including tenotomy, osteotomy, and peel [10] . All of these techniques can predispose to loss of function and tearing of the \nsubscapularis tendon and resultant pain and anterior instability, which can be difficult to diagnose on physical \nexamination [10,63] . This underscores the importance of imaging in this setting. Administration of intra -articular \ncontrast can improve the evaluation for partial -thickness, articular -surface, and full -thickness tears of the rotator \ncuff, although this is dependent on the degree of prosthesis -related artifact (and any reduction provided by advanced \ntechniques ).

As opposed to \nevaluation on MRI, there is no prosthesis -related artifact hindering visualization of the rotator cuff on US. Tears of \nthe supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis tendons can all be diagnosed with US as can long -head biceps \ntendon and subacromial/subdeltoid bursal pathology [41] . US evaluation of the subscapularis tendon has been found \nto be more reliable than physical examination in the setting of prior tendon repair and arthroplasty placement [63] . \nIntegrity of the subscapularis tendon after reverse shoulder prosthesis placement is also well assessed by US, \nalthough the c linical relevance of this integrity is currently unclear [64] . \nSummary  of Recommendations \n\u2022 Variant 1 : Shoulder radiographs are usually appropriate for the routine follow -up of asymptomatic patients \nwith a primary shoulder arthroplasty.  \n\u2022 Variant 2 : Shoulder radiographs are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of symptomatic patients with a \nprimary shoulder arthroplasty.  \n\u2022 Varia nt 3: Following radiographs, image -guided shoulder aspiration is usually appropriate in patients with a \nprimary shoulder arthroplasty when infection has not been excluded.

The RRLs  are based  on effective dose,  which  is a radiation  dose quantity  that is used to estimate  \npopulation total radiation  risk associated  with an imaging  procedure.  Patients  in the pediatric  age group are at \ninherently  higher  risk from  exposure,  because of both organ sensitivity  and longer  life expectancy  (relevant  to the \nlong latency  that appears to accompany  radiation  exposure).

Kransdorf, MD.n \nSummary  of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nIt has been  approximately  60 years since Sir John Charnl ey introduced the modern era of hip replacement  surgery  \n[1]. Approximately  370,000 primary  total hip arthroplasties (THAs)  were performed  in the United  States in 2014  \n[2]. Sloan  et al [2] estimated  that the volume of primary  THAs  would  increase to 635,000 procedure s annually by \n2030.  \nOver  the years,  modifications  have  been  made  to attempt  to decrease  complications  such as loosening and wear  \nwith additional  fixation  techniques  (eg, osseointegration ) and articular  surfaces  (eg, metal  on highly  cross -linked  \npolyethylene , antioxidant  doped polyethylene  liners,  metal -on-metal  [MoM], ceramic on polyethylene , and ceramic  \non ceramic articulations)  [3-5]. \nSecond -generation  MoM prostheses were introduced in the late 1990s  [6]. These  prostheses were preferentially  \nused for younger  patients  with osteoarthritis  [7]. However , reports  of high short -term  failure  rates led to recalls  and \ndecreased  use [8,9] . These articulations  (and also metal  to metal  articulations  at the head  neck  [trunnion] and neck  \nstem  articulation s of modular  components)  may result  in the release of metal  particles and metal  ions leading  to \nmacroscopic necrosis,  osteolysis,  large sterile  hip effusions,  and periprosthetic  solid  and cystic masses termed  \n\u201cpseudotumors\u201d  [10]. The umbrella  terms  adverse local  tissue reaction  (ALTR ) and adverse reaction  to metal  debris  \n(ARMD ) have been  used to refer  to the spectrum  of findings  in failed  metal  on metal  articulations  [11-13]. The \nterm metallosis  refers  to infiltration  of metallic  wear  debris  into periprosthetic  structures [14]. \nThe most  common  causes  for surgical  revision  of THA  from 2012 to 2019 as reported  in the American  Academy  \nof Orthopaedic  Surgeons  American  Joint  Replacement  Registry  were infection  and inflammatory  reaction  (19.3%),  \ninstability  (17.4%),  and aseptic loosening (15.8% ) [15-17]. Wear  or osteolysis was the cause for revision  in 7.5%.  \nThe imaging studies used to follow uncomplicated primary hip prostheses and to assess several prosthesis-related \ncomplications are reviewed . Separate discussions pertinent to imaging of MoM prostheses are included.  \nSpecial Imaging  Considerations  \nUltrasound (US) : US has been  used for assessment  of soft tissues adjacent  to hip arthroplasties and, in contrast  to \nMRI and CT, is not affected  by prosthetic  artifacts.

US may be limited  in its ability  to assess deep  soft tissues.  \nMetal artifact reduction sequences ( MAR S)-MRI : MARS -MRI enable soft tissues around the prosthetic  hip such as \nthe pseudocapsule,  tendons , and neurovascular  structures to be assessed . Reviews of some MARS -MRI techniques  \nare available in the literature  [18-21]. \nMetal artifact reduction ( MAR )-CT : Metallic  hip prostheses,  particularly  cobalt  chrome  components , produce  \nartifacts  on CT scanning  that can obscure  adjacent  structures.  As reviewed  by Roth  et al [22],  these artifacts are \nrelated  to both the prosthesis (eg, type of metal  and geometry)  and the scanning  parameters.  Several  techniques  \nhave  been  used to reduce these artifacts  (termed  MAR ) [22,23] . \nFluorine -18-2-fluoro -2-deoxy-D -glucose ( FDG)-PET/CT Skull  Base  to Mid-Thigh  and Fluoride  PET/CT Skull  Base  \nTo Mid-Thigh : PET studies  (using either  FDG or fluoride ) may be tailored  to focus  imaging  of the area of interest,  \n \naHarvard  Medical School , Boston,  Massachusetts.  bResearch Author, Long Island Jewish Medical Center, New Hyde Park, New York. cPanel Chair, Mayo \nClinic Arizona, Phoenix, Arizona. dRush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois; American College of Physicians. eUniversity of Wisconsin School of \nMedicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin. fMayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. gHospital for Special Surgery, New York, New York. hUniversity of \nArizona, Tucson, Arizona; Commission on Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging. iDuke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina. jUniversity \nof Missouri Health Care, Columbia, Missour i. kCleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio. lNorthwestern Memorial Hospital, Chicago, Illinois; American College of \nPhysicians. mPenn State Milton S.

Many  of the investigations  \nincluded in this document  were performed  before the widespread  availability  of PET/CT,  and consequently,  they \nwere performed  as PET studies without  CT. \nInitial Imaging  Definition \nInitial imaging  is defined  as imaging  at the beginning of the care episode for the medical  condition defined  by the \nvariant.  More  than one procedure  can be considered  usually  appropriate  in the initial imaging  evaluation  when:  \n\u2022 There are procedures  that are equivalent  alternatives (ie, only one procedure  will be ordered  to \nprovide  the clinical  information  to effectively  manage the patient\u2019s  care)  \nOR \n\u2022 There are complementary  procedures  (ie, more  than one procedure  is ordered  as a set or \nsimultaneously  where each procedure  provides  unique  clinical  information  to effectively  manage  \nthe patient\u2019s  care).  \nDiscussion  of Procedures  by Variant  \nVariant  1: Routine  follow -up of the asymptomatic  patient  after  hip arthroplasty.  \nFollow -up after THA usually  continues  throughout  the patient\u2019s  life. Imaging of asymptomatic patients  after hip \narthroplasty  is intended to identify  failure  of prostheses to find those  in need  of early  intervention  [24]. However,  \nmost  patients  requiring revision  are symptomatic  [24]. \nBone  Scan  Hip \nPeriprosthetic  uptake  can be present  for a year or more  after prosthetic  insertion  [25-27]. Therefore , bone  \nscintigraphy of the hip for routine  surveillance of asymptomatic hip arthroplasties is not supported.  \nBone  Scan  with  SPECT  or SPECT/CT  Hip \nData on the normal  evolution of periprosthetic  uptake  on single -photon  emission  computed tomography (SPECT) \nor SPECT/CT of the hip following  hip arthroplasty  are lacking  [28]. \nHowever,  on planar  bone  scintigraphy,  persistent  periprosthetic  uptake  can be present  for more  than 1 year following  \nimplantation  [25-27]. Consequently , bone  scintigra phy with SPECT or SPECT/CT is not supported for routine  \nsurveillance of asymptomatic hip arthroplasties.  \nCT Hip \nThere are no recent  studies  advocating routine CT scanning  of the hip for asymptomatic patients  with conventional  \nor MoM prostheses.  \nFluoride  PET/CT Skull Base to Mid-Thigh \nIt can take a year or more  for periprosthetic  uptake  to normalize around  a hip prosthesis [29,30] . Therefore , fluoride  \nPET/CT skull  base to mid-thigh  is not supported for routine  surveillance of asymptomatic hip arthroplasties . \nMRI Hip \nMRI for asymptomatic  non-MoM hips: MRI is generally  not indicated  in routine  follow -up of asymptomatic patients  \nwith non-MoM  prostheses.  However,  the MRI findings  in asymp tomati c patients  are being  investigated  [19,31-33]. \nMARS -MRI  for asymptomatic MoM prostheses:  Pseudotumors  consistent  with ARMD  have  been  reported  on MRI \nin patients  without  pain following MoM arthroplasties  [6,33- 38]. Thus, MRI may be beneficial in this group.   \nIn a series of MoM hip resurfacing  arthroplasties,  clinical  outcomes  and radiograph ic screening  underestimated  the \npresence of pseudotumors  and supported the use of MRI for screening  [38].", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a2a36fc3-4f6a-4421-89fc-94e4276f8064": {"__data__": {"id_": "a2a36fc3-4f6a-4421-89fc-94e4276f8064", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "ACR imaging after total hip arthroplasty.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "768cbc53-2559-4538-b4ca-b95ecb7970bd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "ACR imaging after total hip arthroplasty.pdf"}, "hash": "c56e22e7be412cc38bce3fa04eba880285dbb17580669c67b6173864b1b37a7e"}, "2": {"node_id": "1164bcc2-80e3-4512-9a0a-bf6663bda09b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "ACR imaging after total hip arthroplasty.pdf"}, "hash": "34c1cf34d9e74ad6843af27fb4598e52076972244ad6f49e627dda8548559d6a"}}, "hash": "17ec03ccb7fcfc6db023bd2b0b242ff4c41e5d3fae54b7a35295291c2c0fd294", "text": "MARS -MRI  for asymptomatic MoM prostheses:  Pseudotumors  consistent  with ARMD  have  been  reported  on MRI \nin patients  without  pain following MoM arthroplasties  [6,33- 38].

Similarly, Koff  et al [33] performed  4 \nyearly  MRI examinations  of patients  with surface replacement  prostheses and found  evidence  of ALTR s in high-\nfunctioning individuals  without  pain.

Review  of serial  radiographs  is useful  for identifying subtle  changes,  emphasizing  \nthe need  for baseline radiographs.  However,  Hart et al [43] followed  postoperative  patients  with THAs undergoing  \nroutine  follow -up, excluding patients  with complications  of fracture,  dislocation, or infection  or who had died.  Of \nthe 423 patients  studied,  414 had radiographs  at 6 to 12 weeks and 276 had follow -up radiographs  at 1 year.  No \nTHA case was identified  in which  clinical  management  was changed  by the radiographic  examination  in this time \nperiod.  This suggested  to the authors  that, in asymptomatic patients, some  follow -up radiographs  might  be omitted.  \nRadiographs  for follow -up of asymptomatic MoM total hip prostheses:  The FDA  recommends routine  long-term  \nfollow -up of patients  with MoM hip implants, typically  to occur  every  1 to 2 years  [44]. This includes  appropriate  \nradiographs.  Serial  radiographs  are helpful  to assess subtle  changes [42]. Radiographs  can be used to assess  \ncomponent  position, component  loosening,  bone  quality,  osteolysis,  fracture,  dislocation  or subluxation,  femoral  \nneck  narrowing,  and medial  femoral  calcar  erosion  [36,45] . The latter  may be an indicator  of ARMD,  warranting  \ncross-sectional  imaging  (positive  predicative value  [PPV ] 0.83)  [45]. \nUS Hip \nUS for follow -up of asymptomatic non-MoM total hip prostheses:  A few studies have  investigated  US to assess  \nasymptomatic patients  with metal -on-polyethylene  (MoP)  bearings [41,46] . Nishii et al [41] conclude d that US \nseemed  a promising  noninvasive tool for detection  of ARMD pseudotumors . However,  there are no recent  studies  \nindicating  the use of US for routine  surveillance of nonmetal  on metal  prostheses.  \nUS for follow -up of asymptomatic MoM total hip prostheses: US may be beneficial  as asymptomatic p atients  may \nshow  imaging  changes of or associated with ARMD  [46].

Imaging remains  \na critical  resource although  its optimal utilization  is still being clarified.   \nCT Hip \nOverall,  CT is less able than MRI to detect  changes associated  with ARMD.  Noncontrast CT may be considered \nfollowing other imaging modalities to assess osteolysis.  \nRobinson et al [134]  found  a sensitivity  of 44% for CT in comparison  with MARS -MRI for ARMD pseudotumor  \ndetection  in patients  with unexplained  painful  MoM  prostheses . Also,  the detected  pseudotumors  could not be \nclassified  as to structure using  CT. Thus,  the authors  concluded that CT would not be a suitable  alternative for \nMARS -MRI and another  study such as US may be considered.  \nCT is also less able to detect  muscle  atrophy.  In comparison  with MARS -MRI , CT demonstrated  a high rate of \nfalse-negative examinations for identifying  muscle atrophy  (sensitivity  of 81%,  specificity  of 37%)  [134] . \nAlthough , Walde  et al [126]  demonstr ated in a cadaver  model  that MRI could  detect  osteolysis with greater  \nsensitivity  than CT. Robinson et al [134]  demonstrated  a reduced  sensitivity  (27%)  and specificity  (1%)  of MARS -\nMRI in comparison  with CT-MAR  for detecting  osteolysis associated  with painful  MoM hip prostheses.  \nMRI Hip \nMARS -MRI has been  used as a reference standard  for imaging  of the soft tissues around prosthetic  hips [134,139] . \nARMD  Pseudotumors : MRI allows demonstration,  localization, measurement,  follow -up, determination  of solid  or \ncystic composition,  and classification  of pseudotumors  associated  with ARMD  [36]. Invasion of adjacent  soft \ntissues,  muscle  atrophy,  and tendon avulsions  can also be assessed  [36,40,131] . \nMahajan  et al [140]  found  a difference in the appearance of pseudotumors  depending  on the site of corrosion.  The \nMoP  group  demonstrated  the highest  proportion of thick -walled  cystic masses (56.7%  in head -neck  taper  corrosion  \nMoP  and 46.5%  in dual taper  corrosion MoP  versus 28.7%  in MoM),  whereas the MoM  group had the highest  \nproportion of thin-walled  cystic  masses [140].  Weber  et al [141]  found no significant  difference between  the MRI \nappearances of symptomatic  and asymptomatic MoP  ARMD . \nSeveral  studies have  compared  MARS -MRI with surgically  proven ARMD pseudotumors.  Sensitivity  ranged  from  \n71% to 93.9%.  Specificity  ranged  from  42.9%  to 87% [39,40,66] .  \nLainiala  et al [39] found  a higher  sensitivity  for detecting  ARMD pseudotumors  for studies performed  within  3 \nmonths before revision  surgery  (88%  sensitivity, 78% specificity) , and a lower  sensitivity  for studies obtained >1 \nyear before  revision  surgery  (sensitivity  29%,  specificity  97%) .

These are complementary procedures (ie, more than one \nprocedure may be ordered. Joint aspiration with synovial fluid analysis remains  probably the most useful test \nfor confirming the presence or absence of infection and identifying the causative organism .  \n\u2022 Variant 5 : In the setting of a symptomatic hip prosthesis evaluated with radiography and when infection has \nbeen excluded , CT hip or MRI hip without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study.  These \nprocedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure will  usually be ordered to provide the clinical \ninformation to effectively manage the patient\u2019s care).  Choice will depend on local preference/expertise.   \n\u2022 Variant 6 : MRI hip without IV contrast  is usually appropriate following radiographs for the evaluation of \nsymptomatic hip arthroplasty patient with MoM prosthesis or findings suggesting trunnionosis when ther e is \nquestion of adverse reaction to metal debris.  \n\u2022 Variant 7 : In the setting of a hip arthroplasty patient with trochanteric pain that has been evaluated with \nradiography, US hip or MRI hip without IV contrast  is usually appropriate for suspected abductor injury, or \ntrochanteric bursitis, or other soft tissue abnormality.

Beaman, MD.k \nSummary  of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nTotal knee  arthroplasty  (TKA),  primarily  used to treat pain and improve  function in patients with symptomatic  \nadvanced  knee  osteoarthritis, is the most  commonly performed  joint replacement  procedure  in the United  States  \n[1,2] . In 2012,  >670,000 knee  replacement  procedures  were performed  in the United  States  [3], which  represents \nan increase of 86% since 2003  [4]. It is estimated  that 4 million  patients  in the United  States  are currently  living  \nwith a knee  replacement  [5]. By 2030,  it is estimated  that the annual  demand  for primary  TKA  will grow  by 673%  \nto 3.48 million  [6]. Factors contributing  to the rising  number  of TKAs include  population growth;  aging  and \nincreased  longevity of the population;  expanded indications  for performing  TKA,  especially  in individuals  >65 \nyears of age; obesity;  decline in postprocedure  complications;  and increased  patient  demand  [7]. \nThe patient  satisfaction  rate for TKA is relatively  high,  ranging  from  75% to 89% [8]. Around  10% to 30% of the \npatients  report  ongoing pain or are not satisfied  with the result  [9]. Factors,  which  contribute  to patient  \ndissatisfaction , include  unmet  expectations,  functional  limitations,  and postoperative  complications  including pain \n[10]. Most  TKA  patients  expe rience improved outcomes  and long implant survival,  with long-term  TKA failure  \nrates of <1% per year [5]. The growth in the number  of primary  TKA  procedures  has been  accompanied  by increased  \nrates of TKA revision  procedures  [1]. Revision  procedures  for TKAs have  increased  by 5.4 procedures  per 100,000  \npersons  per decade over the period from  1990  to 2002,  with a mean  revision  burden of 8.2%  [11]. Nearly  1.5 million  \nof those  with primary  knee  replacement  are 50 to 69 years  of age, underscoring a large population at risk for revision  \nsurgery  and long-term  complications  [5]. Sharkey  et al [12] reviewed  781 revision  TKAs and found  the most  \ncommon  failure  mechanisms  were  loosening (39.9%),  infection  (27.4%),  instability  (7.5%),  periprosthetic  fracture  \n(4.7%),  and arthrofibrosis  (4.5%) . Infection  was the most  common  reason  for early  revision  (<2 years after the \ninitial TKA) , and aseptic loosening was the most  common  reason  for late revision.  Compared  with a review  \nperformed  by the same  author  in 2002 [13], polyethylene  wear  is no longer  the major  cause  of failure , and the \npercentages of revisions  for polyethylene  wear,  instability, arthrofibrosis,  malalignment,  and extensor  mechanism  \ndeficiency  have  all decreased.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5db5cb66-fd72-4d06-ac00-713dba2dced1": {"__data__": {"id_": "5db5cb66-fd72-4d06-ac00-713dba2dced1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "ACR imaging after total knee arthroplasty.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8a878e0d-18f0-4f22-aedd-f8088825d1c6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "ACR imaging after total knee arthroplasty.pdf"}, "hash": "f4e25fe5e383ac654590ba806afcd86c5f986b8e30361d04a02f3208233e748a"}, "2": {"node_id": "7f852faa-77fe-43cc-9061-d054069597f8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "ACR imaging after total knee arthroplasty.pdf"}, "hash": "aa757a9cb66d6b82bafe8f83d09857c97d9aec6a4d0890d4d1bf89a9684b94be"}}, "hash": "f2be56fee182b57b61444c2311d10b0b69b211bedfe81da77078e779530b52b9", "text": "Compared  with a review  \nperformed  by the same  author  in 2002 [13], polyethylene  wear  is no longer  the major  cause  of failure , and the \npercentages of revisions  for polyethylene  wear,  instability, arthrofibrosis,  malalignment,  and extensor  mechanism  \ndeficiency  have  all decreased.  Identifying the cause of a painful  TKA  before  surgery  is critically  important  because  \n\u201cin cases of unexplained pain,  reoperation  is unwise and frequently  associated  with suboptimal  results\u201d [14]. \nSpecial Imaging  Considerations   \nIn some  patients with knee  arthroplasties,  repeated  hemarthroses are caused  by synovial  hyperemia  or true \narteriovenous  malformations.  These patients can be successfully  diagnosed with angiography and treated  with \nembolization. In rare instances,  geniculate and popliteal vessel  injuries  may occur  during surgery  [15]. \nA recent  study reports  single -photon emission  CT (SPECT)/CT  arthrography with Tc-99m  sulfur  colloid  has a high \ndiagnostic  accuracy  (97%)  in the evaluation  of loosening of both hip and knee  arthroplasties in patients with \npersistent  postprocedural  pain [16]. Barnsley  et al [17] also found  arthrography  with SPECT/CT to be an accurate  \nmeans of identifying  aseptic prosthetic  joint loosening . \n \naPenn State Milton S.

Ververeli  et al [27] compared  \nrecovery  room  radiographs  with additional  predischarge radiographs  and found  no change  in the postoperative  \nmanagement  of 124 consecutive  patients  with TKAs and suggested  eliminating  the predischarge radiographs.  \nNovack  et al [25] retrospectively  reviewed  4,830 consecutive patients  following cemented  or uncemented  TKA s \nand concluded routine  recovery  room  radiographs  after an uncomplicated  primary  TKA are not a reliable  \nmechanism  for preventing  mechanical  complications  and did not alter patient  care.  \nAlthough  radiographs  are an integral  part of the workup for suspected  periprosthetic  infection, they are neither  \nsensitive nor specific for diagnosing infection  [28,29] . The radiographic  appearance of an infected  TKA can range  \nfrom  \u201cnormal\u201d to subtle  periprosthetic  lucency  to advanced  bone  destruction.  Joint  effusion  and soft tissue swelling  \nare often  noted as well.  It is often  not radiographically possible  to distinguish  infection  from  loosening or particle  \ndisease [21]. Duff  et al [18] found  radiographs  unhelpful  because loosening,  periostitis,  focal  osteolysis,  and \nradiolucent  lines  were seen in both infected  and noninfected knees.  Because minor  differences in positioning  can \ngreatly  alter the appearance of the periprosthetic  lucencies,  the use of oblique  or fluoroscopically positioned  images  \nmay provide  improved visualization  of the prosthesis-bone  interface,  especially  with uncemented  prostheses [30]. \nSerial  follow -up radiographs  are more  directed  toward  identifying  postoperative  complications  related  to loosening \nand are important  for identifying  subtle  changes  [31,32] . Although  follow -up radiographs  are commonly performed,  \nthe frequency  of assessment  has not been  standardized.  A survey  of 682 active members  of the American  \nAssociation  of Hip and Knee Surgeons  in 2003 found that 80% of responders  supported annual  or every -other  year \northopedic  and radiographic  examinations  and more  frequent  follow -up if there  were signs  of failure,  decreased  \nperiprosthetic  bone  quality,  or a history  of prior  revision  [33]. The routine  annual  or every  other  year radiographic  \nexamination  for TKA evaluation  consists of standing anteroposterior  (AP) and lateral  and a tangential  axial  view  \nof the patellofemoral  joint. Some  practitioners also use standing long-leg (hip-to-ankle)  views to provide  for optimal \nassessment  of alignment  [4]. Skytta  et al [34] compared  standing hip-to-ankle  radiographs  and AP knee  radiographs  \nfor assessment  of alignment  and found  that the standard  AP knee  radiograph was a valid  alternative  to the hip-to-\nankle  radiograph for determining  coronal  plane  alignment  at the knee,  but that the longer  hip-to-ankle  radiograph  \nalone  provided accurate information  on the weightbearing  mechanical  axis in patients  with suspected  lower  limb \nmalalignment.

An effusion  may be present.  \nFindings  can be subtle  and annual  weightbearing  radiographs  are suggested  for detecting  subclinical  wear  [21]. \nCollier  et al [36] found that 87% of measurements performed  on standing  frontal  knee  radiographs  (on the basis of \nthe minimum  distance from  the metallic femoral  condyle  to a line through the top surface of the baseplate at its \nwidest  dimension)  were within  1 mm of the known implant  thickness,  but the accuracy  decreased  for evaluating  \npolyethylene  thickness in patients  with wear  requiring revision.  \nInstability  is evaluated  on radiographs  obtained  in extension -flexion  position,  under  varus -valgus  stress,  and during \nanterior  and posterior  drawer  maneuvers.  In contrast,  malalignment  refers  to suboptimal  alignment  of the prosthesis  \ncomponents  relative  to each other  (although it is occasionally  used to describe alignment  of the bones  in relation  to \neach other  and to the joint)  [37] and is evaluated  on full-length  standing  radiographs  of the lower  extremity  [21]. \nRadiographs  including  the entire  prosthesis are the initial examination  for assessment  of suspected  periprosthetic  \nfractures.  Radiographs  are also usually  satisfactory  for assessment  of patellar  complications  [20] and helpful  in \nguiding treatment  [38]. Axial  radiographs  demonstrate the degree of patellar  tilt or subluxation [21]. Baldini et al \n[39] proposed  a weightbearing  axial  radiograph to better  assess patellofemo ral kinematics.  \nAlthough  axial  radiographs  may be used to determine axial  rotation  of the femoral  component  [40], CT is most  \ncommonly used for this purpose.

Additional imaging  following  radiographs. \nInfection  is a serious complication  of joint arthroplasty  and is reported  in 0.8%  to 1.9%  of TKAs [43]. The frequency  \nof infection  is increasing  as the number  of primary  arthroplasties increases [44]. Infection  may be acute  or delayed , \nwith delayed  infection  defined  as occurring at least 3 months  postoperatively  [45]. In a series,  infection  was \nresponsible  for 37.6%  of early  revisions  and 21.9%  of revisions  performed  >2 years after the initial operation [12]. \nStaphylococcus  aureus  and coagulase-negative  Staphylococcus  species,  including  Staphylococcus  epidermidis,  are \nthe most  common organisms  associated  with these infections  [46]. Both  clinical  findings  and laboratory tests may \nserve useful  in addition  to imaging  studies.  Low-grade  or chronic  TKA  infections  may be difficult to diagnose  \npreoperatively.  Duff  et al [18] noted that diagnosis  of infection  was not obvious  in 53% of knees before  revision  \narthroplasty.  Pain is the most  common  presenting  symptom  of infection, but pain is a nonspecific finding [47]. In \nacute infection,  findings  such as pain,  swelling,  warmth,  erythema,  and fever  are common,  whereas chronic  \ninfections  may be manifested  by pain alone  [44]. Night  pain or pain at rest is characteristic of infection, whereas  \npain on weightbearing  is more  characteristic of mechanical  loosening.  Some  authors  suggest  that infection  needs to \nbe excluded  in all patients  with pain persisting  >6 months  after joint replacement  [18]. \nLaboratory findings  in the setting  of TKA infection  are often  nonspecific.  Peripheral  leukocyte  counts  are not \nelevated  in most  patients  with infected  prostheses.  Erythrocyte  sedimentation  rates (ESRs) are abnormal  in patients  \nwith infection, but this finding  may also be seen in uninfected  patients,  limiting  the usefulness of the test [48]. A \nretrospective review of 68 patients  undergoing hip and knee  revision  surgery  indicated  that C-reactive protein  (CRP)  \nwas significantly  higher  in patients  with infection  compared  with those  with loosening (sensitivity  of 79% for all \nprostheses) ; however , a normal  CRP  level  did not exclude  infection  [49].", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b943d31-a065-4845-8068-52384803042d": {"__data__": {"id_": "7b943d31-a065-4845-8068-52384803042d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "ACR imaging after total knee arthroplasty.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b2f533e0-bab2-4103-aa15-b49a504d6ce9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "ACR imaging after total knee arthroplasty.pdf"}, "hash": "b7d8adfacbce1bc25484067947dd61c7c5e7bad310e3444dad8cbc81c1be78d1"}, "2": {"node_id": "842a6fb6-2515-4a55-a551-ae3b409b9856", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "ACR imaging after total knee arthroplasty.pdf"}, "hash": "4536c12358111d1bbe2520259d8c701d5ad5dcc67e8e32f46fb9933b34c89fd5"}}, "hash": "f9d262e072b622c2c3ab0ce04d27c751bcdcad5e97aa3924a3a11e71101d174b", "text": "A \nretrospective review of 68 patients  undergoing hip and knee  revision  surgery  indicated  that C-reactive protein  (CRP)  \nwas significantly  higher  in patients  with infection  compared  with those  with loosening (sensitivity  of 79% for all \nprostheses) ; however , a normal  CRP  level  did not exclude  infection  [49]. CRP  has a sensitivity  of 73% to 91% and \na specificity  of 81% to 86% for the diagnosis  of prosthetic  knee  infection  when  a cutoff  of \u226513.5 mg/L  is used [44]. \nAlthough CRP  can be elevated  after surgery,  under  normal  circumstances  it generally  returns  to baseline within  2 \nmonths  [44]. A large multicenter  study found CRP  and joint aspiration  to be the most  useful  tools  to diagnose  \ninfection  [50]. In an attempt  to construct  an algorithm  for evaluating  TKA infection,  Savarino  et al [51] found that \nabnormal  results  for at least 2 of 3 tests (CRP  [cutoff  0.93 mg/L],  ESR [cutoff 27 mm/h],  and fibrinogen  [cutoff  \n432 mg/dL])  led to accurate results for the diagnosis  of infection  (sensitivity, 93%;  specificity,  100%;  accuracy,  \n97%) . More  recently,  interle ukin-6  has also shown  promise  for diagnosing  infection , with higher  predictive  values \nthan most  other  serologic  markers [52], and has shown  excellent  sensitivity  for detecting  infection  after TKA when  \ncombined with CRP  [53]. The American  Academy  of Orthopaedi c Surgeons  (AAOS ) guidelines  strongly  \nrecommend  the use of ESR, CRP , and serum  interleukin -6 testing  for patients  being assessed  for periprosthetic  joint \ninfection  [54]. Serologic  tests can be hard to interpret  when  underlying inflamm atory  arthropathy is present  [28]. \nMore  recently,  the use of an alpha -defensin  laboratory  test has been  described  for the diagnosis  of periprosthetic  \njoint infection.  Alpha -defensin  is an antimicrobial  peptide  that is naturally  released  by neutrophils  responding to a \npathogen in the synovial  fluid.  Used  as a biomarker  for infection  in synovial  fluid, it has been  demonstrated  to be \nhighly accurate in the diagnosis  of prosthetic  joint infection, nearly  matching  the Musculoskeletal  Infection  Society  \ndefinition  for prosthe tic joint infection  [55-57]. In a study by Deirmengian  et al [56] of 149 synovial  fluid  aspirates,  \nsynovial  fluid  alpha -defensin  tests alone  demonstrated  a sensitivity  of 97% and a specificity  of 96% for the diagnosis  \nof periprosthetic  joint infection, and the combination of synovial  fluid  alpha -defensin  and CRP  tests demonstrated  \na sensitivity  of 97% and a specificity  of 100%  for the diagnosis  of periprosthetic  joint infection . A recent  review  \nsuggests the preoperative  workup for periprosthetic  infection  should include  serum  ESR rate and CRP , serum  D-\ndimer,  synovial  fluid  culture,  cell count , and differential, leukocyte  esterase,  alpha -defensin,  and synovial  fluid  ESR \n[58].", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a91f992b-ad39-412d-a27f-26435cc3d45d": {"__data__": {"id_": "a91f992b-ad39-412d-a27f-26435cc3d45d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "ACR imaging after total knee arthroplasty.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a5826633-c74e-4828-b18f-0e936d8df7a6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "ACR imaging after total knee arthroplasty.pdf"}, "hash": "5ee286dd2e440f559f90660a2da0f304a8af457f8fcb6c617f8f4cd1ab8dd08b"}, "3": {"node_id": "f824d0c7-31c4-4334-9e82-58397da92e8b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "ACR imaging after total knee arthroplasty.pdf"}, "hash": "e646c639304a20bd891baffd4c3a87bae59498a3d4ab735e9ab24caa8ed8658b"}}, "hash": "e11983fb893f69708d7c234e04160b1ed2c978ecb4aa80b1b8bea6bb1ed25e49", "text": "ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 8 Imaging  After  Total  Knee  Arthroplasty  3-Phase  Bone  Scan  Knee  \nTc-99m  bone  scintigraphy  is more  sensitive than radiographs  in the detection  of osteomyelitis  [59]. However,  \nperiprosthetic  uptake  on bone  scan is a nonspecif ic finding and cannot  differentiate  infection  from  aseptic loosening \n[60] and can be seen because of normal  remodeling after prosthesis  surgery  (for up to 1-2 years or longer)  [61], \ninfection, asept ic prosthesis loosening [62], and/or  periprosthetic  fracture.  Normal  bone  scans have  a high negative  \npredictive  value  (NPV)  and indicate  that infect ion, loosening,  or fracture is unlikely.  It is usually  stated  that bone  \nscintigraphy is useful  for excluding osteomyelitis  and hence is useful  as a screening  study  [30,59,63] . A 3-phase  \nversus single -phase (a delayed -only skeletal  acquisition)  bone  scan does not improve  the accuracy  of the test [64]. \nThe accuracy  of bone  scans,  either  single  phase or 3-phase,  for diagnosing complications  of lower  extremity  \nprosthesis is approximately 50% to 70% with a normal  study,  excluding a prosthetic  complication  as the cause of \nthe patient\u2019s  symptoms  [65]. The classic finding  for an infected  TKA is increased  uptake  on all 3 phases in the same  \nlocation  (a positive  3-phase bone  scan)  [30]. However,  increased  uptake  is a nonsp ecific finding and may persist  on \na bone  scan even  as a postsurgical  finding in the absence of infection  and >1 year after surgery,  and it can also be \nseen with aseptic  loosening [59]. In fact, Duff  et al [18] reported  persistent  bone  scan activity  in the absence of \ninfection  2 years after surgery . This activity  is not likely  to be 3-phase positive. Bone  scans can potentially  be \nnegative  with loosening at the cement \u2013prosthetic  interface,  which  does not incite  new bone  formation  [66]. \nAlthough Love  et al [64] report  that the use of 3-phase bone  scintigraphy does not improve  the accuracy  of the test, \nSmith  et al [60] found that infection  is more  likely  than aseptic loosening if there  is increased  uptake  on both blood-\npool and delayed  images.  Their  analysis of 80 bone  scans in patients  with postoperative  pain found  that no patient  \nwith infection  had a negative  3-phase bone  scan [60]. Given  the limited  specificity  of this test, patients  with \nabnormal  bone  scans and suspected  infection  should  undergo additional assessment  to help in characterizing  the \nbone  scan abnormality  [64]. Overall,  3-phase bone  scans may be useful , even  though their accuracy  is lower  than \nthat of the WBC  or FDG-PET/CT scan [63]. \nCT Arthrography  Knee  \nCT joint arthrography can assess for lucency  with contrast  accumulation  at the bone/cement/hardware interface.  \nThese areas of lucency  are not specific for infection  versus mechanical  loosening.  \nCT Knee  With  IV Contrast  \nCT has a limited  role in the workup  of periprosthetic  infection.

Advances in metal  artifact  reduction may expand the potential  role of CT. \nFDG -PET/CT  Whole  Body  \nFDG-PET/CT scans may be useful  for detecting  infection  after joint replacement.  FDG-PET images reflect  relative  \nlevels of glucose uptake  and thus reflect  the localized  level  of increased  metabolic  activity. Zhuang  et al [68] \nreported  that elevated  glycolytic  activity  causes  inflammatory  cells such as neutrophils  and activated  macrophages  \nto be FDG avid at sites of inflammation  and infection.  Some  periprosthetic  uptake  may occur  because of marrow  \nactivity, and adding marrow  scanning  can increase specificity  [69]. In these instances,  the marrow  study would be \nperformed  the next day using a different  camera type because  the marrow  scan relies on lower  energy photons  (PET, \n511keV;  Tc-99m,  140 keV).  Zhuang et al [68] studied 36 painful  knee  prostheses using FDG -PET and identified  \n10 of 11 infected  cases but had false-positive  results in 7 cases (sensitivity  of 90.9%,  specificity  of 72%,  and \naccuracy  of 77.8%  for detecting  infection) . This was a lower  accuracy  than found in assessment  of hip prostheses.  \nThe cause for the large number  of false- positives  was not known.  Aksoy  et al [70] found a positive  predictive  value  \n(PPV)  of 28% (15 of 54) for infection  in 54 patients  with painful  joint prosthesis (24 knee,  48 hip) using FDG -PET.  \nManthey  et al [71] reported  that, by analyzing  intensity  and periprosthetic  uptake  patterns on FDG-PET, accurate  \ndifferentiation  among aseptic loosening,  synovitis, and infection  is possible .

Kwee et al [73] in a meta -analysis reported  that the specificity  of FDG-PET for diagnosing  infection  \nwas signi ficantly  lower  for knee  prostheses (74.8%)  than for hip prostheses (89.8%) . Delank  et al [74], in a series  \nof both hip and knee  prostheses,  found that a negative PET scan excluded  infection  (100%  sensitivity) . If the scan \nwas positive, differentiation  between  wear  and infection  was not possible.  Prandini  et al [75] performed  a meta -\nanalysis of the diagnostic  performance  of different  radiotracers in peripheral  osteomyelitis  and prosthetic  joint \ninfections,  yielding  results for FDG-PET  with a sensitivity  of 94%,  a specificity  of 87%,  a PPV of 87%,  an NPV  of \n94%,  and an overall  accuracy  of 92%.  Although metal  artifacts  have  very little impact  on nuclear  medicine  \nexaminations  (except  as photopenic  defects)  and create negligible  scatter  [68,76,77] , high PET attenuation  \ncoefficients in the area of metal  can lead to an overestimation  of the PET activity  in that region and thereby  to a \nfalse-positive  PET finding.  Nonattenuated  PET images,  which  do not manifest  this error,  can be used in these cases  \nto aid the interpretation  of these metal -induced artifacts.  \nSynovitis  and aseptic loosening (in hip prostheses)  may cause  increased  FDG  uptake  [69]. Sterner  et al [78] \nexamined  14 patients  with painful  TKA to detect  early  aseptic loosening.  Overall  accuracy  was 71% (sensitivity,  \n100%;  specificity,  56%).  In addition,  Stumpe  et al [79] found diffuse  synovial  and focal  extrasynovial  FDG uptake  \nin patients  with component  malrotation. They  concluded  that this test is noncontributory in individual patients  with \npersistent  pain.  Studies  in patients  with hip prostheses have  shown  that postoperative  remodeling can result  in \nartifactual  periprosthetic  FDG uptake  for up to 6 months  after implant insertion  [80]. Noting  the lack of specificity  \nfor detection  of periprosthetic  infection  on conventional  FDG-PET, Aksoy  et al [70] explored  the use of FDG-\nlabeled  leukocyte  PET/CT  for imaging  patients  with painful  joint prostheses and found a sensitivity  of 93%,  a \nspecificity  of 97%,  a PPV of 93%,  and an NPV of 97%.  However,  this examination  is not in general  use. Basu  et al \n[81] found  the sensitivity, specificity,  PPV, and NPV of FDG-PET in knee  prostheses were 94.7%,  88.2%,  69.2%,  \nand 98.4%,  respectively,  in 87 patients  with knee  prostheses suspected  of being either  infected  or experiencing  \nnoninfectious  loosening.  Van Acker  et al [82] investigated  the use of FDG-PET in combination with bone  scans  \nand showed  no advantage  over HMPAO-labeled  WBC and bone  scans.

This can be performed  on fluid  aspirated  either  preoperatively  or \nintraoperatively. Some  authors  prefer  intraoperative  aspiration  because  of better  control  of contaminants.  The \nsynovial  fluid  is usually  evaluated  with Gram  stain,  total and differential  cell counts,  and aerobic  and anaerobic  \ncultures [30,44] , although Gram  stain  has a relatively  poor sensitivity  and specificity  [84]. There  are discrepancies  \nin the literature  with regard  to the optimal cutoff  levels for determining  the WBC and percentage of \npolymorphonuclear  leukocytes  in the aspirated  joint fluid  that best distinguish  infected  from  noninfected fluid  \n[85,86] . Toms  [87] proposed obtaining  three samples,  including one tissue sample,  at the time of aspiration,  with \nthe test then considered  positive  when  two specimens grow  out the same antibiogram. An absence of fluid  (ie, \u201cdry \ntap\u201d)  at the time of aspiration  does not necessarily  indicate  the absence of infection  [88]. Duff  [18] found sensitivity,  \nspecificity,  and accuracy  of 100%  for aspiration  in a series of 43 knees  with pain,  instability, loosening,  or suspected  \ninfection  undergoing  surgical  revision.  In contrast,  radiographic  findings  did not separate infected  from  noninfected \npatients.  Virolainen  [49] found joint aspiration  to be 100%  specific and 75% sensitive for diagnosing infection  and \nto be the best test for diagnosing infection  in a group of 68 total hip and knee  replacement  patients. Bach  [45] found  \nthat early  aspiration  led to a significant  reduction in the duration  of treatment  and a better  outcome.  In 16% of \npatients,  more  than three aspirations were necessary  to obtain  a positive  culture.  Barrack  [89] noted  that false  \nnegative  aspirations may occur  in patients  who have  had preaspiration  antibiotic  treatment.

Weekly  repeat  aspirations may \nbe needed  if the first aspiration  is negative  and clinical suspicion  for infection  remains high.  Even  with a negative  \npreoperative  aspiration,  intraoperative  tissue may indicate  infection. Bernard  [50], after literature  review  and a \nmulticenter  trial, advocated  CRP  and joint aspiration  as the best tools  for diagnosing prosthetic  joint infection.  When  \nthe CRP  level  is >10 mg/L, repeat  joint aspiration  or biopsy is suggested.  Della  Valle  [90] also found the \ncombination of ESR and CRP  to be a good screening  tool for infection,  with only one infected  knee  having negative  \nresults on both tests.  These authors  suggest  preoperative  aspiration  if the ESR or CRP  is elevated  or if clinical  \nsuspicion  is high,  combined with intraoperative  frozen  section  analysis of the periprosthetic  synovial  tissue [90]. \nThe AAOS  gives  a moderate strength  of recommendation  for synovial  fluid  testing  including  leukocyte  count  and \nneutrophil  percentage,  aerobic and anaerobic bacterial  cultures,  leukocyte  esterase,  alpha -defensin,  CRP,  and \nnucleic acid amplification  testing  (eg, polymerase chain  reaction ) for bacteria  [54]. A recent  manuscript  advises  \nintraoperative  synovial  fluid  re-cultures are necessary  even  if the preoperative  aspiration  culture  is positive  and any \ndiscordance between  preoperative aspiration  culture  and intraoperative  synovial  fluid  culture  should be noted [91]. \nIf the joint aspirate culture  is positive  on the basis of both cell count  with differential  and positive  cultures,  then \ninfection  is considered  likely  and treatment  is initiated  [54,92] . In that setting, no further imaging  is supported for \nthe diagnostic  workup of the infection. Berbari  [46] studied  897 cases  of periprosthetic  joint infection  and found  \nthat approximately 7% were associated  with negative  cultures.

Comparison  of activity  on the WBC image  with activity  on a bone  scan \n(usually  a 3-phase bone  scan)  has been  advocated.  A positive  study  for infection  generally  requires focal  increased  \nactivity  on the WBC  study in the same  location  and distribution  as the positive  3-phase bone  scan [100] . Using  a \nsequential  combination of bone  and In-111-labeled  leukocyte  scans in patients  with loose  or painful  knee  prostheses  \nfound a sensitivity  of 88%,  a specificity  of 78%,  a PPV of 75%,  and an NPV of 90% for diagnosis  of infection. \nThey  noted an area of potential utility  for leukocyte  scans,  specifically  that a negative indium  leukocyte  scan might  \nsupport  the absence of infection  in otherwise equivocal  cases and in situations  in which a  musculoskeletal  \npathologist  is not available to interpret  an intraoperative  frozen  section  [100] . A small  sample  of indium  scans in \nuncomplicated postoperative  TKA patients  has shown  that inflammation  can persist  around the operative  site in the \nabsence of infection  [100] . Bernard  et al [50] reported  a multice nter trial of various  methods  for diagnosing hip and \nknee  infections.  Scans using tagged  WBCs  or radiolabeled  immunoglobulin demonstrated  a sensitivity  of 74% and \na specificity  of 76% for diagnosing  infection.  A literature  review indicates  sensitivities  of 40% to 96% and \nspecificities  of 76% to 100%  for WBC scans of joint prostheses [49,50,99- 104]. Therefore,  these studies are not \nuseful  as routine  for differentiating  mechanical  failure  from  occult  infection  in painful  loose  total knee  prostheses.  \nFilippi and Schillaci  [105]  applied  SPECT/CT using a hybrid camera  to conventional  planar  Tc-99m -HMPAO-\nlabeled  leukocyte  scintigraphy in patients with suspected  infection. SPECT/CT was able to differentiate  soft-tissue  \ninvolvement  from  bone  involvement.  The authors  argued  that SPECT/CT might  eliminate  the necessity  for a \ncorrelative bone  scan with labeled  leukocyte  scans.  WBC scans also have  a decreased  sensitivity  with low-grade  \ninfection  [66] and a limited  neutrophilic  component.  Labeled  leukocyte  imaging  may lead to a high false- positive  \nrate because leukocytes  accumulate in reactive bone  marrow  as well as in infection  and it is not always possible to \ndifferentiate  between  the two [64,106] . \nThe addition  of Tc-99m -labeled  sulfur  colloid  bone  marrow  scanning  has been  investigated  to reduce this confusion.  \nPalestro  et al [107]  reported  that sequential  combined leukocyte/marrow  imaging  was 95% accurate for diagnosing  \nprosthetic  knee  infection  and was superior  to bone  scans alone  or to bone  scans in combination with labeled  \nleukocyte  imaging.  Joseph  et al [106]  found that low sensitivity  and the potential for false- negative  results made  \nthis combination of scans of limited  utility  for diagnosing prosthetic  infection, and therefore  it is no longer  used at \ntheir institution.

Overall , the performance of the \nlabeled  leukocyte  marrow  scan protocol  was nonetheless thought  to be of limited  clinical  utility  [106] . In contrast,  \nLove  et al [69] found the combination  of In-111-labeled  leukocyte/Tc -99m -labeled  sulfur  colloid  marrow  scanning \nto be the reference standard  for diagnosing periprosthetic  infection . The authors  found  the combination of labeled  \nWBC and marrow  scanning  to be 100%  sensitive and 100%  specific for diagnosing  infection  in TKA  [69]. \nSemiquantitative  assessment  of WBC scans using a combination of early  and delayed  imaging  as a substitute  for \nbone  marrow  imaging  produced a >90% sensitivity  and specificity  in one series [99]. Love  et al [109]  examined  \n150 failed  joint prostheses  with histopathologic  correlation  and found that leukocyte/marrow  imaging  yielded  a \nsensitivity  of 96%,  a specificity  of 87%,  and an accuracy  of 91%.

Infection  excluded.  Suspect  aseptic loosening  or osteolysis or \ninstability. Additional imaging  following  radiographs. \nImaging of rotational instability  of a TKA is discussed  in greater  detail  under  Variant  5. If a patient  has undergone  \na full workup  and infection  has been  excluded,  then loosening should be considered  as the potential cause of knee  \npain and periprosthetic  lucency.  In multiple  studies,  aseptic loosening has been  found to be a common cause of \nTKA failure  [13,110-112] . Sharkey  et al [13] found  aseptic loosening to be the major  cause of late stage (>2 years)  \nTKA failure.  Aseptic loosening may occur  either  because of inadequate  primary  fixation  or because of failure  after \nsuccessful  fixation. It is thought  to result  from  mechanical  stresses,  osteolysis secondary  to particle  debris,  or poor \nbone  stock  [21].

Osteolysis is a leading  cause of late TKA revision.  \nOsteolysis,  also known  as particle  disease and aggressive granulomatosis,  occurs secondary  to macrophage  \nphagocytosis  of particle  debris.  Debris originating  from  polyethylene,  cement,  and metal  can all be causes of cell-\nmediated  inflammatory  response  and osteolysis [113] , but typically  polyethylene  is the most  common  cause.  Areas \nof osteolysis contain  granulation  tissue with phagocytosed particulate  debris  [21]. The incidence of osteolysis is \nhigher  for cementless,  compared  with cemented  TKA  [114] . Osteolysis can occur  anywhere  but is more  common  \nin the region  of the femoral  condyles  near the attachment  of the collateral  ligaments,  along the periphery  of the \ncomponent,  and along  the access channels to the cancellous bone  of the tibia, including  screw holes  [114,115] . \nPatients  with osteolysis may be asymptomatic early  on but can go on to develop  pain,  swelling,  and acute synovitis.  \nAlthough small  areas of osteolysis  may be monitored,  the presence of large areas  of osteolysis suggest  component  \nloosening and may require  revision  surgery  [116] . Imaging can also help evaluate available bone  stock  in \npreparation  for revision  surgery.  Instability  refers  to abnormal  and excessive displacement  of the articular  surfaces  \nof the prosthesis  [21]. Instabil ity usually  occurs because of surgical  error and/or  poor prosthesis selection  and often  \nresults in revision  surgery  an average of 4 years after the primary  arthroplasty  [21]. Severe instability  can result  in \ndislocation. In a 2014 review of 781 cases of prosthesis failure,  Sharkey  et al [12] found that instability  represented  \nthe third  most  common  cause of prosthesis failure  overall,  accounting  for 7.5%  of all cases.  The concepts of \ninstability, malalignment, and loosening in TKA are closely  interrelated  [117] . When  malalignme nt of the joint is \ncreated  at the time of surgery,  minor  degrees of instability  can become a significant  problem.  By the same  token,  \ninstability, ongoing over time, can give rise to malalignment, which,  in turn, can lead to loosening.  Although \nligamentous  balance/imbalance plays  a role in joint instability, it is not the only factor  accounting for stability  [118] . \n3-Phase  Bone  Scan  Knee  \nThere is insufficient  evidence to support  routine  use of Tc-99m  3-phase bone  scans for the assessment  of instability.  \nBone  scintigraphy may be helpful  in diagnosing loosening,  especially  when  obtained many  years after surgery  [62]. \nThis delay  in maximum utility  is because of  the observation that positive  bone  scans are noted in 20% of \nasymptomatic knees 1 year after surge ry and in 12.5%  of individuals  2 years after surgery [61] . Serial  bone  scans \nmay be more  helpful  than a single  examination  [119] . Generally,  increased  uptake  on the delayed  images  but not \non the blood- pool phase is thought  to be due to loosening rather  than to infection  [60]. Normal  scans are most  \nhelpful  and are characterized  by a high NPV,  indicating  that loosening or infection  is unlikely.

Smith  et al [60] evaluated  80 bone  scans in patients  with symptomatic  TKA,  classifying  even  mildly  \nincreased  activity  on either  blood-pool  or delayed  images as abnormal,  and found a high sensitivity  (92.3%)  for \ndistinguishing abnormal  (ie, those  with either  loosening or infection)  from  normal  TKA.  The test was not specific  \nin that it was unable  to distinguish  between  aseptic loosening and infection  [60]. If infection  is excluded  by other  \nstudies,  loosening  of the tibial component  may be detected  using quantitative  analysis of bone  scintigraphy,  with a \nsensitivity  of 90% and a specificity  of 100%  [120] . The 3-phase bone  scan is moderately  sensitive (76%)  in \nidentifying  the failed  joint prosthesis but with a specificity  of only 51% and an accuracy  of 50% to 70% [121] . A \npositive  3-phase  bone  scan demonstrates  increased  periprosthetic  uptake  in both focal  and diffuse  patterns,  but even  \nwith SPECT/CT it can still be difficult to distinguish  between  infection  and aseptic loosening,  the latter  of which  is \ndue to either  inadequate  initial fixation, mechanical  loss of fixation  over time, or biologic  loss of fixation  caused  by \nparticle  induced  osteolysis around the implant. Murer  et al [122]  reports  that the sensitivity  and specificity  for \ndetection  of tibial component  loosening  was 96.0%  and 100%,  respectively,  and the sensitivity  and specificity  for \ndetection  of femoral  component  loosening was 95.0%  and 100%,  respectively . The bone  scan; however,  can be \nuseful  as a screening  test, with a high NPV with 1 caveat.

MRI and CT have  both been  shown  to be more  sensitive  \nfor detection  of osteolysis than radiographs  [116] . CT can be used to detect  osteolysis  and to determine the total \nvolume  of osteolytic  lesions,  particularly  when  metal  reduction techniques are used [124] . CT is supported by Math  \net al [20] to look for osteolysis in patients  with painful  knee  prostheses who have  normal  or equivocal  radiographs  \nand increased  uptake  on all 3 phases of a bone  scan.  Reish  et al [67] found that only 17% of 48 lesions visible  by \nCT were detected  on radiographs.

Imaging of rotational instability  of a TKA is \ndiscussed  in greater  detail  under  Variant  5. \nFDG -PET/CT  Whole  Body  \nSterner  et al [78] examined  14 patients  with painful  TKA  using FDG-PET to detect  early  aseptic loosening.  Overall  \naccuracy  was 71% (sensitivity, 100%;  specificity,  56%).  Delank  et al [74], in a series of both hip and knee  \nprostheses,  found that a negative  PET scan excluded  infection  (100%  sensitivity). If the PET scan was positive , \nthen differentiation  between  wear  and infection  was not possible . Soft-tissue inflammation  begins  before  prosthetic  \nosteolysis,  both of which  are often  asymptomatic until the need  for surgery.  Metallic  artifact  also hinders  CT and \nMRI assessment  of this osteolysis at the prosthetic -bone  interface.  FDG accumulates in cells with high glucose  \nuptake.  Other  than tumor  cells,  FDG  accumulates in areas  of inflammation  and infection  because of activated  \nlymphocytes,  neutrophils,  and macrophages.  Jansen  et al [66] reported  that postoperative  remodeling can be seen \nas nonspecific  periprosthetic  uptake  in the first six months  after arthroplasty.  A nega tive FDG study has a high NPV  \nfor loosening  related  to particle  disease,  which  incites  a granulomatous  response.

Using  metal  artifact  reduction techniques,  Fritz  et al [93] described  what  they posited  are distinct  \nappearances for an intact  periprosthetic  interface (direct  contact  of the implant or cement  with the surrounding  \nbone),  a periprosthetic  fibrous  membrane  that indicates limited  implant fixation  that may or may not progress to \nloosening  (1- to 2-mm thick  layer  with smooth margins  surrounding the prosthesis along the bone  interface)  and \nfrank  bone  resorption (a periprosthetic  layer  >2-mm thick  with irregular  margins).  They  reserve the use of the term \nloosening for cases in which  MRI demonstrates circumferential  osseous resorption together  with signs  of implant \ndisplacement,  subsidence,  or rotation.

MRI  \nwith metal  artifact  reduction techniques  can detect  osteolysis that is not visible  on radiographs,  even  around the \nfemoral  component  [96]. An MRI investigation  of 11 TKA suspected  of osteolysis on radiographs  (and \nsubsequently confirmed  by surgery)  found 10 cases with osteolysis at MRI and confirmed  at surgery,  5 cases with \nadditional  osteolytic  lesions detected  on MRI,  and 9 cases in which  lesions were larger  on MRI than on radiographs  \n[97]. MRI can also show  synovial  changes due to particle  disease before  osteolytic  lesions become apparent  [22]. \nWhen  effective,  metal  suppression  can be used, and  MRI can allow  direct  visualization  of ligaments  and tendons  \nabout  the knee  [93]. \nUS Knee  \nUS has no significant  role in assessing  for aseptic  prosthesis loosening and is not typically  used for the assessment  \nof osteolysis.  US can be used to evaluate synovitis  and soft tissues about  the joint and to guide  joint aspiration  [132] . \nUS is not typically  used for assessment  of instability  but can be used to visualize and assess  the medial  and lateral  \ncollateral  ligaments  in the setting  of TKA  [133] . \nWBC  Scan  and Sulfur  Colloid Scan  Knee  \nIn-111 WBC,  Tc-99m  labeled  WBC,  and Tc-99m  sulfur  colloid  knee  scans are not useful  for evaluation  of aseptic  \nknee  prosthetic  loosening.

Beaman , MD.p \nSummary  of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nAxial  spondyloarthritis  or axial  spondyloarthropathy (axSpA)  describes a heterogeneous  group of inflammatory  \ndisorders  affecting  the axial  skeleton  that were historically  classified  separately  as ankylosing  spondylitis  (AS) , \nreactive arthritis, psoriatic  spondyloarthritis,  enteropathic  spondyloarthritis,  juvenile  spondyloarthritis , and \nundifferentiated  spondyloarthritis  [1]. The prevalen ce of axSpA  is estimated  to be between  0.9% to 1.4%  in the \nUnited  States  adult  population [2]. There  is a genetic component  to axSpA,  including  a strong  association  with \nHLA-B27 , which  is positive  in 74% to 89% of patients  [1]. Patients  with axSpA  often  present  before  age 45 with \nchronic  back  pain and stiffness and may have  elevated  inflammatory  markers  [3]. A clinical hallmark  is the presence  \nof inflammatory  back  pain,  which  is present  in 70% to 80% of patients  [4]. There are varying definitions  for \ninflammatory  back  pain,  although  characteristically  this pain includes the following  features:  insidious  onset,  \nimprovement  with exercise,  no improvement  with rest, occurring  at night,  and age of onset  <40 years of age [4]. \nInflammatory  back  pain symptoms,  depending on the criteria  used,  have  been  reportedly been  present  in 5% to 6% \nof the general  adult  population  [5], and in up to 15% of patients  in the primary  care setting  [6]. Although recognition  \nof axSpA  is improving,  a mean  delay  of 4.9 years from  onset  of symptoms  to diagnosis  was recently  reported , \nhighlighting the challenge of establishing  this diagnosis  early  in the disease course  [7]. \nPatients  with axSpA  suffer from  an inflammatory  arthropathy  of the axial  skeleton  that classically  involves  the \nsacroiliac  joints  initially  [3]. There is some  heterogeneity in disease distribution  within  axSpA  subtypes . Patients  \nwith AS typically  develop bilateral  sacroiliitis , whereas patients  with other  subtypes , such as psoriatic  \nspondyloarthritis , develop either  unilateral  or bilateral  sacroiliitis  [8]. Classically,  axSpA  after first involving the \nsacroiliac joints and then may progress  to involve  the spine . However,  the pattern  of disease can be variable with a \nminority  of patients  having isolated  spine  involvement  [3]. The thoracic spine  and thoracolumbar  junction  are the \nmost  common  sites of spinal  involvement  [9-13].", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f55ef8e9-e182-4530-b9a2-97b9a2587994": {"__data__": {"id_": "f55ef8e9-e182-4530-b9a2-97b9a2587994", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "ACR inflammatory back pain.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cb092b52-f8c5-4d97-8f0f-7fe43e5c03d0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "ACR inflammatory back pain.pdf"}, "hash": "4882754b952356f463450c522887b0d2c05ea0d35592659b9c33449c722cef53"}, "2": {"node_id": "bb5386ac-481e-4b33-a36b-7f8371f3fffb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "ACR inflammatory back pain.pdf"}, "hash": "3095ef1d03948df55a3a6b93d61027deaa59977b133508dfa8a27ad99d051d09"}}, "hash": "d811904faf46fe1c24dae39ee59a951105a114463af30e9af5848cc00386fd33", "text": "Classically,  axSpA  after first involving the \nsacroiliac joints and then may progress  to involve  the spine .

The thoracic spine  and thoracolumbar  junction  are the \nmost  common  sites of spinal  involvement  [9-13]. The inflammatory  changes of enthesitis,  synovitis,  and osteitis  in \naxSpA  result s in bone  erosion,  sclerosis,  bone  formation,  and potentially  ankylosis  at sites of involvement  [1]. \nApproximately 30% to 50% of patients  with axSpA  have  associated  peripheral  arthritis  or enthesitis  [3]. The \napproach  to peripheral  spondyloarthritis  is discussed  in the ACR  Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae topic  on \u201cChronic  \nExtremity  Joint  Pain-Suspected  Inflammatory  Arthritis \u201d [14]. \nImag ing plays  a critical  role in the diagnosis  of axSpA.  Historically , imaging  diagnosis  was based  on radiographs  \nusing the modified  New York  criteria  [15]; however,  the radiographic  changes of axSpA  were  subsequently  found  \nto evolve  slowly  over the course of years [16,17] . Additionally, some  patients  with symptomatic  AS did not have  \nradiographic  evidence of axSpA  [18], driving  the search  for additional  imaging  biomarkers  of early  disease.  As \nevolving literature  accumulated  on the utility  of MRI in axSpA , the Assessment  of SpondyloArthritis  international  \nSociety  (ASAS)  establish ed diagnostic  criteria  in 2009 for axSpA  that included  MRI in the diagnostic  algorithm, \npromoting the diagnosis  of both patients  with radiographically eviden t axSpA  (radiographic -axSpA  or classic AS) \nas well as patients  with negative  radiographs  who may have  inflammatory  changes demonstrated  on MRI \n(nonradiographic -axSpA)  [17,19] .

This \nis the topic  of some  debate [1,21-23] . The development  of the ASAS  criteria facilitated  diagnosis  of patients  at an \nearlier  stage of disease and allowed  more  patients  with axSpA  to be considered  for biologic  therapy  [17,19,22] . \nHowever,  care should be taken  to acknowledge  that the ASAS  criteri a are designed  for use in clinical  research , not \nfor definitive  clinical  diagnosis .  \nTreatment  algorithms  focus  on controlling disease activity  and improving  quality  of life. Multiple  studies have  \nshown  that axSpA  patients  report  decreases  in quality  of life measures and that high levels of disease activity  are \nassociated  with more  profound decreases [24-26]. In AS specifically,  it has been  shown  that worsening  functional  \nimpairment  over time correlates with worsened  structural  changes and disease activity  [27-29]. In patients with \nactive disease  despite nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs , treatment  with biologic  agents such as tumor  necrosis  \nfactor  (TNF) -\u03b1 antagonists  has become standard  of care with 24 randomized  controlled  trials  demonstrating their \nefficacy  in improving patient\u2019s  self-reported  outcomes,  decreasing  clinical  disease  activity, and decreasing  \ninflammatory  changes on MRI upon  follow -up [30]. Recommendations  for treating  radiographic -axSpA  and \nnonradiographic -axSpA  are similar  [30]. \nBeyond the important  roles of imaging  in early  diagnosis  and treatment  in axSpA patients,  those  with advanced  \naxSpA  resulting  in ankylosis  are a subset  of patients  that warrants further discussion.  These patients,  classically  \nconsidered  to have  AS, develop spinal  rigidity  combined with osteoporosis  resulting  in a risk of fracture  even  with \nlow energy  trauma  or no apparent  trauma  [1,31-33] . These fractures  are often  unstable  and involve  all 3 spinal  \ncolumns  [31,34] . The cervical  spine  is most  frequently involved  [32,33,35] . Associated  neurologic  deficits have  \nbeen  reported  in 21% to 100%  of patients , and other  complications  reported  in 84% of patients  [32]. The diagnosis  \ncan be delayed  in 15% to 41% of cases,  and therefore , clinical  suspicion  for fracture  must  be elevated  in the \nappropriate  setting  given the severity  of these injuries. Many  patients  undergo surgical  fixation  of these injuries, \nalthough unfavorable  outcomes  with relatively  high morbi dity and mortality  are reported  [32,35] . Early  use of \nadvanced  imaging  modalities  is crucial  in these patients  to facilitate  a timely  diagnosis.  \nInitial Imaging  Definition \nImaging at the beginning  of the care episode  for the medical  condition defined  by the variant.

In cases of those  with a short  duration of symptoms,  MRI of the sacroiliac joints  could be considered  as \nthe initial imaging  modality  [22]. \nMRI Spine  Area  of Interest  \nMRI is not routinely  obtained  as the initial imaging  modality  in the evaluation  of suspected  axSpA,  and there  is no \nrelevant  literature  supporting MRI of the spine  in this setting.  \nRadiography Sacroiliac  Joints  \nRadiographs  of the pelvis  have  long been  used as the first-line imaging  modality  for evaluation  of patients  with \nsuspected  axSpA  [3,15,22] . The ASAS  recommends radiographs  of the whole  pelvis  to evaluate the sacroiliac joints  \nas well as the hips,  which  can also be involved  in axSpA  [38]. There  has been  close agreement  shown  between  \nanteroposterior  and oblique  sacroiliac joint radiographs  with no benefit  of adding oblique  views  [39]. Comparison \nof the anteroposterior  and Ferguson views  has shown  general  agreement  with no superiority of one view over the \nother  [40]. Radiographs  demonstrate  chronic  erosions,  sclerotic changes,  and ankylosis  as the sequela of \ninflammatory  sacroiliitis, although radiographs  are unable  to demonstrate active  inflammation  [38]. As a result,  \nthere is a low sensitivity  of radiographs  for detection  of early  disease [16,17] .

These structural  changes,  including  erosions,  sclerosis,  bone  formation,  and ankylosis,  are best \ndemonstrated  on sacroiliac  protocol  examinations  that include  obliquely oriented  reformatted  images prescribed  \nparallel  and perpendicular  to the long axis of the sacrum  [54].

One study shows that DECT  has a sensitivity  of 87% to 93% \nand specificity  of 91% to 94% for detection  of bone  marrow  edema using  MRI as the reference standard,  but more  \ndata are needed  to support  the diagnostic  utility  of DECT  in the evaluation  of axSpA  [56].  \nThere is no role for intravenous ( IV) contrast  in CT evaluation  of axSpA.  \nCT Sacroiliac  Joints  and Spine  Area  of Interest  \nCT demonstrates structural  changes in the sacroiliac joints  and spine  in patients  with axSpA  that may not be apparent  \non radiographs  [22]. These structural  changes  include  erosions,  sclerosis,  bone  formation,  syndesmophytes,  and \nankylosis  [49,54] . In addition  to its diagnostic  utility  in assessment  of the sacroiliac joints, CT of the spine  has the \nability  to demonstrate  syndesmophytes  with higher  sensitivity  than radiographs , and low-dose  protocols  can be \nutilized  [58].

However,  \nspinal  involvement  is common,  and numerous  studies have  shown  that axSpA  involvement  can be isolated  to the \nspine,  isolated  to the sacroiliac joints, or can involve  both the sacroiliac joints  and spine  [19,59-63] .

In one study,  the interreader  reliability  of diagnosing sacroiliitis  on PET/CT was poor and substantially  lower  \nthan that for MRI or CT [67]. In a small  study using radiographs  as the reference standard,  F-18-fluoride  PET/CT  \nhad a sensitivity  of 80% and specificity  of 77% for the detection  of sacroiliitis  in AS, although there are inherent  \nlimitations  in the use of radiographs  as the reference  standard  for diagnosing axSpA  [73]. Given  the available data,  \nthe utility  of PET/CT in the diagnosis  of axSpA  is uncertain  at this time. \nMRI Sacroiliac  Joints  \nAfter  radiography is performed,  MRI of the sacroiliac joints  is the next imaging  technique  of choice in the evaluation  \nof patients  with suspected  axSpA  [1,3,19,22] . MRI of the sacroiliac joints  is widely  recognized  as an important  tool \nin the evaluation  of patients  with suspected  axSpA,  resulting  in improved diagnostic  confidence  and yielding  \nfindings  that stimulate  changes  in both diagnosis  and treatment  plans  for patients  [1,3,19,22,74] . Additionally, MRI  \nfindings  have  been  shown  to be predictive  of both subsequent  radiographic  disease progression and the likelihood  \nof response to therapy  [36,63,75,76] . \nMRI,  utilizing  short  tau inversion  recovery  (STIR ) and T1-weighted  images,  can identify  both active inflammatory  \nlesions of the sacroiliac joints  (bone  marrow  edema,  capsulitis,  synovitis,  and enthesitis ) and chronic  structural  \nlesions (sclerosis,  erosions,  fat deposition,  and ankylosis)  that are typical  for sacroiliitis  [38,77]. MRI demonstrates \nactive sacroiliitis  with higher  sensitivity  and earlier  than radiography because of  its ability  to detect  inflammatory  \nlesions of axSpA  [13,36,37,78] . The inflammatory  changes of sacroiliitis  on MRI have  been  shown  to precede  \nstructural  radiographic  findings  by three  to seven  years  [36,37] . MRI can also detect  the chronic  structural  lesions  \nof the sacroiliac joints  with higher  accuracy  than radiographs  [45]. \nIt is important to recognize  that the sensitivity  and specificity  of MRI for axSpA  depends  on the imaging  criteria  \nused,  patient  population,  and reference standard  for diagnosis.  Early  literature  showed  95% sensitivity  and 100%  \nspecificity  of MRI for sacroiliitis , substantially  higher  than radiographs  or bone  scintigraphy,  although  that study \nincluded a small  number  of patients , and most  subsequent  studies demonstrate  smaller  yields  [41]. The ASAS  \ncriteria  developed in 2009  utilize  the presence  of bone  marrow  edema  to define  a positive  MRI of the sacroiliac  \njoints  in axSp A [79]. Using  solely  the imaging  arm of the ASAS  algorithm  (which  includes positive  radiographs  or \npositive  MRI with one clinical  axSpA  feature),  the ASAS  criteria  were initially  shown  to have  a sensitivity  of 66.2%  \nand specificity  of 97.3%,  although by combining  both imaging  and clinical  arms  of the algorithm  the sensitivity  \nwas 82.9%  and specificity  was 84.4%  for axSpA  [19].", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "af65d8af-3951-4406-b9c7-1bb5fe9bae58": {"__data__": {"id_": "af65d8af-3951-4406-b9c7-1bb5fe9bae58", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "ACR inflammatory back pain.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "48dc8951-b544-4d9f-8804-86dd43816042", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "ACR inflammatory back pain.pdf"}, "hash": "f4a85c9e27d7457c5cbed74ddb8d0c50b2a1e0394fb2413c1e55bd5156415376"}, "2": {"node_id": "58e6b4ea-6aea-4e23-ada9-97b609740820", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "ACR inflammatory back pain.pdf"}, "hash": "8355d78bb1f23c9cd422200a2480b2379e917f11d2fc360f13f04c6c6ec3d684"}}, "hash": "73a9ecc0af89937be0ca5b71bb1ba4a0247eb65eb803a387acd2d30ff7c0ce0c", "text": "Using  solely  the imaging  arm of the ASAS  algorithm  (which  includes positive  radiographs  or \npositive  MRI with one clinical  axSpA  feature),  the ASAS  criteria  were initially  shown  to have  a sensitivity  of 66.2%  \nand specificity  of 97.3%,  although by combining  both imaging  and clinical  arms  of the algorithm  the sensitivity  \nwas 82.9%  and specificity  was 84.4%  for axSpA  [19]. Subsequently,  in an inception  cohort  followed  for 8 years,  \nthe ASAS  definition  of a positive  MRI demonstrated  a sensitivity  of 79% and a specificity  of 89% for the diagnosis  \nof axSpA  [80]. Although  the presence of bone  marrow  edema provides  a sensitive evaluation  for inflammatory  \nchanges in axSpA,  bone  marrow  edema  can also be seen in noninflammatory conditions  such as in age-related  \ndegenerative changes,  postpartum  patients,  patient s with chronic  back  pain,  athletes,  and in up to 30% of healthy  \ncontrols  [81-85]. As a result,  the ASAS  MRI criteria  have  been  criticized  for decreased  specificity  of bone  marrow  \nedema as the sole MRI diagnostic  criteri on [82]. Importantly, although bone  marrow  edema may be nonspecific  in \nsome  cases,  one study found that the presence of a deep  bone  marrow  edema lesion  which  extend s at least 1 cm \ndeep  to the articular  surface is more  specific and found almost  exclusively  in axSpA  [86]. Structural changes of \naxSpA  including  erosions,  sclerosis,  fatty deposition,  and ankylosis  are not accounted  for in the ASAS  definition  \nof a positive  MRI,  although they are important  findings  in axSpA  and should be identified  in clinical  practice [38]. \nTwo related  studies  on a group of 187 patients  demonstrated  high sensitivity  of 90% to 92% and specificity  of 94% \nto 97% for the diagnosis  of AS by using  global  assessment  of both inflammatory  and structural  lesions [83,87], and \nsubsequently this group of authors  showed  that identifying  erosions  and/or  bone  marrow  edema increases  sensitivity  \nfor axSpA  compared  with bone  marrow  edema alone,  without  decreasing  specificity  [85]. They  also showed  that \nidentifying  erosions  and/or  bone  marrow  edema  on MRI increased  both sensitivity  and specificity  for axSpA  \ncompared  with the diagnostic  criterion  of solely  bone marrow  edema [88]. Subchondral  fatty deposition,  another  \nchronic  finding of structural  marrow  remodeling,  is an additional  helpful  and highly specific finding in axSpA  with \nreported  specificities up to 95% to 98% [89,90] . Finally, intra-articular  signal  changes including  increased  T1 signal,  \nT2 hyperintense  joint fluid,  and ankylosis  are highly  specific findings  for axSpA , and when  found  together  with \nbone  marrow  edema can increase the positive  predictive  value  for a diagnosis  of axSpA compared  with bone  marrow  \nedema alone  [91,92] . Overall,  it is clear  that interrogation of sacroiliac joint MRI  using both STIR  and T1-weighted  \nimages is critical  to identify  both the inflammatory  and structural  changes of axSpA  in clinical practi ce. \nMRI has long been  considered  inferior to CT in demonstrating the structural  changes of axSpA,  although evolving  \nliterature  demonstrates that a specific MRI sequence,  volumetric  interpolated  breath -hold  examination  (VIBE),  can", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0311fce9-5140-4e84-885e-b888beec835f": {"__data__": {"id_": "0311fce9-5140-4e84-885e-b888beec835f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "ACR inflammatory back pain.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4bb39602-4026-4ef5-8066-f2aea34ac1c8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "ACR inflammatory back pain.pdf"}, "hash": "4fe1aa813fc2d4c9d1bdcab278a839811473c5ab795abd4b6244a68fe13474c1"}, "3": {"node_id": "9d07de1f-da76-45e7-9024-75968f521eb0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "ACR inflammatory back pain.pdf"}, "hash": "adbdfb4bb44aecd785ef4e86c661e818935b13ec9889a69186c999190d159c9d"}}, "hash": "68b7cda7f5a13041c48d9d87561346554b797c99ab894c8ed3c73ec0d974c943", "text": "ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 9 Inflammatory  Back  Pain demonstrate erosions  with higher  sensitivity  and similar  specificity  compared  to conventional  T1-weighted  \nimaging , and may be comparable to CT [93,94] , making it a promising technique  for identifying structural  lesions  \nof axSpA  on MRI.  \nMultiple  studies have  examined  diffu sion-weighted  imaging  and dynamic  contrast -enhanced  MRI to determine their \ndiagnostic  utility  and performance as imaging biomarkers  of inflammation .

Although  there is \nagreement  in the literature  and among experts that MRI should include  the sacroiliac  joints, there is not a \nconsistently  established  convention  to guide  the clinician  on whether  to image  only the sacroiliac joints  or both the \nsacroiliac joints  and the spine  in patients  with suspected  axSpA  [1,3,19,22] . Not unexpectedly,  there  is heterogeneity  \nin clinical  practice  regarding the use of MRI to evaluate the sacroiliac joints  and/or  spine  in these patients  [112] . \nOne study has shown  that the majority  of patients  can be diagnosed with axSpA  by obtaining MRI of the sacroiliac  \njoints only [60]. Another  study shows that the addition  of spine  MRI  to sacroiliac joint MRI adds little incremental  \nvalue  in the diagnosis  of nonradiographic  axSpA  [113] . However,  axSpA  often  involves  the axial  skeleton  proximal  \nto the sacroiliac joints  and may exhibit  findings  isolated  to the spine.  For example,  in a study of whole -body MRI  \nin active axSpA,  99% of patients  were  found to have  active inflammatory  lesions  in the axial  skeleton,  with \ninflammatory  changes isolated  to the sacroiliac joints  in 52% of patients,  inflammatory  changes isolated  to the spine  \nin 5% of patients , and with inflammatory  changes at both the sacroiliac joints  and spine  in 41% of patients  [59]. \nOther  studies have  shown  widely  varying degrees of isolated  spinal  involvement  on MRI ranging from  1% to 49% \n[19,60- 63,114,115] . In early  axSpA,  it has been  shown  that inflammation  involving  both the sacroiliac joints  and \nspine  can be seen in 28.3%  of patients  [116] . Therefore,  it can be useful  in some cases  to image both the sacroiliac  \njoints  and the spine  to help ensure MRI yields  the highest  diagnostic  utility  and establishes the extent  of disease  \nburden.

Although there  is some  disagreement  about  the extent  to which  inflammatory  changes in the axial  \nskelet on correspond with symptoms,  imaging  the spine  in the clinical  region of interest  is beneficial  in the setting  \nof referable symptoms  [62,117 -119] . Multiple  authors  utilize  whole -spine  or whole -body MRI to identify  the burden \nof disease throughout  the spine  rather  than imaging  specific segments because findings  may potentially  be found in \nany portion of the spine  [10,59,63,89,114,120-122] . \nThe spine  MRI findings  of axSpA  include  the active inflammatory  changes of spondylitis  and spondylodiscitis,  \ninflammatory  changes of the costovertebral  joints, costotransverse joints, and facet  joints, and areas of enthesitis  \nalong other  vertebral  ligamentous  attachments [123] .

The presence of multiple  lesions in the spine  has shown  to \nbe useful ; specifically  the presence of at least 5 inflammatory  lesions or 5 fatty lesions  in the spine  has been  shown  \nto have  a specificity  of 95% for axSpA  [89]. One study shows that the corner  sign in the lumbar  spine  on T1-\nweighted  or T2-weighted  images without  fat saturation  has a sensitivity  of 62% and specificity  of 96% for AS [12]. \nFurthermore,  it has been  shown  that the presence of multiple  fatty corner  lesions in the spine  has a high specificity  \nof 98% and can be useful  in the absence of active inflammatory  lesions  [11].

Conventional  bone  scintigraphy has low to moderate sensitivity  and variable  \nspecificity  for the diagnosis  of axSpA  [41,42,50] . If bone  scintigraphy is used,  because of  the complexity  of the \nspine anatomy,  the use of SPECT should be performed  during  the examination  [51]. Although  bone  scintigraphy is \nnot typically  performed  during the evaluation  of suspected  axSpA  because of  its limited  diagnostic  utility, there is \nrecent  data that hybrid SPECT/CT has higher  sensitivity  than conventional  bone  scintigraphy in the detection  of \nsacroiliitis  [52,53] , although  there  is not enough evidence at this time to support  its routine  use for evaluating  the \nsacroiliac joints  or spine . \nCT Spine  Area  of Interest  \nCT demonstrates structural  changes in the spine  that may not be apparent  on radiographs  [22], including structural  \nchanges such as erosions,  sclerosis,  bone  formation,  syndesmophytes,  and ankyloses  [49,54] .

Corey, MD.v \nSummary  of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nIn the United  States,  acute low back  pain (LBP),  with or without radiculopathy , is the leading  cause of years lived  \nwith disability  and the third  ranking cause of disability -adjusted  life years  [1]. It is the fifth most  common  reason  \nfor a physician  visit in the United  States  and accounts for approximately  3% of visits  to the emergency  department  \n[2]. \nThe American  College  of Physicians and the American  Pain Society  classify  LBP into the following  broad  \ncategories:  nonspecific LBP, back  pain potentially  associated  with radiculopathy or spinal  stenosis,  and back  pain \npotentially  associated  with another  specific spinal  cause [3]. Additionally,  guidelines  from  the American  College  \nof Physicians and the American  Pain Society  [3,4]  emphasize a focused  history  and physical  examination,  \nreassurance,  initial pain management  medications if necessary,  and consideration  of physical  therapies without  \nroutine  imaging  in patients  with nonspecific  LBP. Duration  of symptoms  also helps  guide  treatment  algorithms  in \npatients  with acute,  subacute,  or chronic  LBP. Additionally, assessment  of psychosocial  risk factors when  obtaining  \npatient  history  is a strong predictor  of patients  who are predisposed  to developing chronic  disabling LBP problems  \n[3]. \nAlthough there  is great  variability  in the definition  of acute and subacute  LBP, for the purposes  of this guideline,  \nwe will use the Institute  for Clinical Systems  Improvement  definitions  of 0 to 4 weeks to define  acute LBP,  4 to 12 \nweeks for subacute LBP, and >12 weeks for chronic  LBP [5]. \nIt is clear  that uncomplicated  acute  LBP and/or  radiculopathy is a benign,  self-limited  condition  that does not \nwarrant  any imaging studies [4,6,7] . Imaging is considered  in those  patients who have  had up to 6 weeks of medical  \nmanagement  and physical  therapy  that resulted  in little or no improvement  in their back  pain.  It is also considered  \nfor those  patients  presenting  with red flags , raising  suspicion  for a serious underlying  condition,  such as cauda \nequina  syndrome  (CES),  malignancy,  fracture,  or infection  (see Table 1). \n \naUniversity of Utah Health, Salt Lake City, Utah. bResearch Author, University of Utah Medical Center, Salt Lake City, Utah. cPanel Chair, University of \nUtah, Salt Lake City, Utah. dPanel Vice- Chair, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Saint Louis, Missouri. eUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, \nPennsylvania. fThe Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio. gMontefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "24a8182e-5f03-4086-ac8d-3a2335ac139d": {"__data__": {"id_": "24a8182e-5f03-4086-ac8d-3a2335ac139d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "ACR low back pain.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "83c1ecec-4d7c-4323-a63d-2c66043f5301", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "ACR low back pain.pdf"}, "hash": "959bc72f5fb0d03b122adc84ce19373a434142e38326da7f00968627cfb3dcba"}, "2": {"node_id": "15c0b6bd-6154-4ad4-b12d-317a6dbaa4e5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "ACR low back pain.pdf"}, "hash": "f08b47e60e0c0ce5ae772c298a4d261da913110ab2389d4c9f90ce5b2b538a24"}}, "hash": "0a6e00e99f4b87f00dd24ac8f3576e86580e157f062629d04482e7fe42834002", "text": "aUniversity of Utah Health, Salt Lake City, Utah. bResearch Author, University of Utah Medical Center, Salt Lake City, Utah. cPanel Chair, University of \nUtah, Salt Lake City, Utah. dPanel Vice- Chair, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Saint Louis, Missouri. eUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, \nPennsylvania. fThe Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio. gMontefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York. hUK Healthcare Spine \nand Total Joint Service, Lexington, Kentucky; American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. iEmory University, Atlanta, Georgia. jUCLA Medical Center, \nLos Angeles, California; Neurosurgery expert. kMayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. lJohns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland. mUniversity of Michigan, \nAnn Arbor, Michigan. nJacobi Medical Center, Bronx, New York. oRush University, Chicago, Illinois; Neurosurgery expert. pUniversity of North Carolina \nSchool of Medicine, Chapel Hill, North Carolina; American Academy of Neurology. qPennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, \nPennsylvan ia; American College of Emergency Physicians. rMedical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina; North American Spine Society. \nsUniversity of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California. tIndiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana; American College of \nPhysicians. uUniversity of Colorado School of Medicine, Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado. vSpecialty Chair, Atlanta VA Health Care System and \nEmory University, Atlanta, Georgia.  \n The American College of Radiology seeks and encourages collaboration with other organizations on the development of the ACR Appropriateness \nCriteria through representation of such organizations on expert panels.

However, an important age-related risk factor for spinal fracture presenting as LBP  is osteoporosis.  As \nbone mass decreases slowly over time, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age, and differs by sex, race, \nethnicity  [10], and comorbidities. In line with the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations for patients  \nages 65 and older being screened for osteoporosis, patients  >65 years of age may be considered at risk for \nosteoporotic fracture when presenting with LBP . \nAdditionally,  for those  patients without  neurologic  compromise  and who present  with minor  risk factors for cancer,  \ninflammatory  back  disease  (eg, ankylosing spondylitis), vertebral  compression  fracture,  or symptomatic  spinal  \nstenosis,  imaging  should be considered  after a trial of therapy  [4]. \nIn the majority  of patients, no specific pathology for LBP can be identified. Also,  studies have  shown  imaging  \nabnormalities  in a substantial  number  of people  without back  pain [11-13].

No red flags.  No prior  management.  Initial \nimaging.  \nImaging is typically  not warranted  in this setting. Acute (<4 weeks\u2019  duration)  uncomplicated  (no red flags)  LBP, \nwith or without radiculopathy,  is considered  a self-limiting  condition  that is  responsive to medical  management  and \nphysical  therapy  in most  patients  [4,6,7] . Numerous  studies have  shown that routine  imaging  provides  no clinical  \nbenefit  in this group  [6,9] . Usually  no specific pathology for LBP can be identified. \nNonspe cific lumbar  disc abnormalities  are common in asymptomatic patients  and can be demonstrated  readily  on \nMRI,  CT, fluoroscopic  myelography,  and postmyelography CT of the lumbar  spine  [11]. Imaging abnormalities  \ncan be seen in a substantial  number  of people  without back  pain [11-13]. A prospective study by Carragee et al [13] \nfound that among patients with lumbar  imaging  abnormalities  before the onset  of LBP, 84% had unchanged or \nimproved findings  after symptoms  developed.  A systematic review of 33 articles found an increasing prevalence of \ndegenerative spine findings in asymptomatic patients of increasing age  [12]. For example,  disc protrusion  \nprevalence increased  from  29% of those 20 years of age to 43% of those  80 years of age in this asymptomatic  \npopulation.  A prospective  cohort  study of 20 patients  showed  no significant differences in MRI changes over 12 \nmonths  in patients  presenting  with acute LBP compared  with their asymptomatic counterparts , except  in disc \nherniation,  nerve  root compression,  and annular  fissure [15]. Even  in the setting  of disc herniation,  imaging  may \nhave  limited  role in management  as the majority  of disc herniations  show  some  degree of reabsorption  or regression  \nby 8 weeks after symptom onset  [16]. It is important  to note that repeat  imaging  in patients  with new episodes of \nLBP and previous  MRI scans are unlikely  to detect  differences in disc protrusion,  annular  fissures,  high-intensity  \nzones,  or end-plate  signal  changes [13]. \nDespite the lack of evidence to support  imaging early  or prior  to conservative treatment  for LBP, there is significant  \nvariation  in the ordering practices of physicians,  with nonadherance  to guidelines  leading  to increased  health  care \nutilization  [17,18] . A retrospective cohort  study of 145,320  patients \u226566 years of age  with acute nonspecific  LBP, \nrevealed  27.2%  received  radiography  and 11.1%  received  CT or MRI within  4 weeks of the initial primary  care \nprovider  visit [18]. A prospective  population-based  cohort  study  of 1,770 patients  with acute occupational  LBP \nshowed  that 336 (19.0%)  received  lumbar  MRI within  6 weeks of presentation  (nonadherent  to guidelines).  This \nnonadherent  group had an increased  likelihood  of lumbosacral  injections  or surgery  for outpatient, inpatient, and \nnonmedical  services,  and disability  compensation  [17].

Other  etiologies  include  neoplasm,  infection/inflammation, spinal  stenosis,  and \nhemorrhage.  \nMultifocal deficits  and progressive neurologic  deficits can be caused  by a number  of other  noncompressive  \netiologies  with some  overlapping clinical  features.

Radiography  \nwith anteroposterior  and lateral  radiographs  is useful  for assessing  LBP in patients  with low suspicion  of trauma  or \nminor  trauma  and patients  suspected  of having possible vertebral  compression  fracture.  Upright  radiographs  provide  \nuseful  functional  information  about  axial  loading.  Flexion  and extension  views can be performed  to evaluate for \nspine  stability. Evaluation  of the extent  of vertebral  body  comminution  is limited  on radiography,  particularly  in \npatients with osteoporosis.  \nVariant  7: Low  back  pain  with  or without  radiculopathy.

Initial imaging.  \nA systematic review examining studies that used red flags  as an indication  for screening  found  that of all the red \nflags,  only a history  of cancer  has been  shown  to increase  the probability  of finding spinal  malignancy  [61]. In a \npatient  suspected  of having cancer,  MRI without  and with IV contrast  is considered  superior  in evaluation  of \nlocalizing  disease (intramedullary, intradural -extramedullary,  and extradural)  as well as assessing  extent  of the \nlesion.  For malignant/metastatic  disease,  both bony/marrow  involvement  and neural  compression  from  epidural  \ntumor  are visualized  with high spatial  resolution  [62]. Although CT lumbar  spine  without  IV contrast  can be \nperformed  to evaluate osseous  integrity  (eg, pathologic  fracture)  when  involved with tumor,  intradural  and spinal  \ncord pathologies  are poorly  depicted  on CT. Bone  scan remains invaluable  when  a survey  of the entire  skeleton  is \nindicated  (eg, for metastatic disease) ; however , MRI offers  greater  specificity  than bone  scan,  with comparable  \nsensitivity  and the added  advantage  of providing  anatomic detail  [63]. Although  osseous destruction , as well as \nidentifying  lytic or sclerotic lesions can be detected  on radiography,  at least half of the bone must  be eroded  before  \nthere is a noticeable change on radiographs  [64]. Whole -body  FDG-PET/CT  is typically  not an initial imaging  study  \nbut can be used to evaluate for widespread  metastatic disease and can distinguish  benign versus malignant  \ncompression  fractures [65,66] . \nIn a patient  with suspected  spinal  infection, MRI without  and with IV contrast  is preferred  because of its  high \nsensitivity  and specificity.  MRI can localize the site of infection  and assess the extent  of extradural/epidural  and \nparavertebral  involvement.  The addition  of IV contrast  with fat suppression  is invaluable  in identifying  epidural  \nand paraspinal  abscess [65] and helps  distinguish  abscess from  phlegmon [67].

The different  label  provides  transparency  \nregarding the panel\u2019s recommendation.  \u201cMay  be \nappropriate\u201d  is the rating  category  and a rating  of 5 is \nassigned.  \nUsually  Not Appropriate  1, 2, or 3 The imaging  procedure  or treatment  is unlikely  to be \nindicated  in the specified  clinical  scenarios,  or the \nrisk-benefit  ratio for patients  is likely  to be \nunfavorable.  \nRelative Radiation Level  Information  \nPotential adverse health  effects associated  with radiation  exposure  are an important  factor  to consider  when  \nselecting  the appropriate  imaging  procedure.  Because there is a wide  range  of radiation  exposures associated  with \ndifferent  diagnostic  procedures,  a relative radiation  level  (RRL)  indication  has been  included for each imaging \nexamination.  The RRLs  are based  on effective dose,  which  is a radiation  dose quantity  that is used to estimate  \npopulation total radiation  risk associated  with an imaging  procedure.  Patients  in the pediatric  age group are at \ninherently  higher  risk from  exposure,  because of both organ sensitivity  and longer  life expectancy  (relevant  to the \nlong latency  that appears to accompany  radiation  exposure).  For these reasons,  the RRL  dose estimate ranges  for \npediatric  examinations  are lower  as compared  with those  specified  for adults  (see Table below).  Additional  \ninformation  regarding radiation  dose assessment  for imaging  examinations  can be found in the ACR  \nAppropriateness Criteria\u00ae Radiation  Dose Assessment  Introduction  document  [71].", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0d2ad78b-0d4b-4b20-b531-06e8dfa9da0b": {"__data__": {"id_": "0d2ad78b-0d4b-4b20-b531-06e8dfa9da0b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "ACR management of vertebral compression fracture.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "366da0cc-0616-4fbb-9ab3-f77fb1be78f6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "ACR management of vertebral compression fracture.pdf"}, "hash": "7fd331deac7e4f8d32f3279a7d3107862adc6d7d107e44839e663ba840f3366b"}}, "hash": "04b6d423c69fc1b95b6b5f2e2f6af7874ea2083b34f2ece22bb0c5864a613b04", "text": "Revised 2022  \nACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 1 Vertebral Compression Fractures  American  College  of Radiology  \nACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae \nManagement  of Vertebral  Compression  Fractures  \nVariant  1: New  symptomatic  vertebral  compression  fracture (VCF) identified  on radiographs.

Neoplasms may incorporate  \nprimary/secondary  bone  tumors  and myeloma.  Painful VCFs may cause a marked  decline in physical  activity  and \nquality  of life, leading  to general  physical  deconditioning with increased  psychological  distress.  This physical  \ndeconditioning,  in turn, may prompt  further complications  related  to poor inspiratory  effort  (ie, atelectasis and \npneumonia)  [1] and venous  stasis (ie, deep  venous  thrombosis  and pulmonary embolism)  [2]. Successful  and timely  \nmanagement  of painful  VCFs can improve  quality  of life, increase the likelihood  of an independent  and productive  \nlife, and prevent  superimposed  medical  complications.  \nThis document  addresses the management  of both osteoporotic  and pathologic  VCFs.  \nComprehensive  medical  management  involves  appropriate  osteoporos is screening  and follow -up treatment  (see the \nACR  Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae topic  on \u201cOsteoporosis and Bone  Mineral  Density \u201d [3]). The postmenopausal  \nfemale population is most  at risk for developing osteoporotic  fractures of any type,  and VCFs comprise  25% of \nosteoporotic  fractures [4-6]. However,  there is also an increased  incidence of osteoporosis-related  fragility  fractures  \nin males [7], with a lack of widespread  awareness of the risk of osteoporosis  in men currently  comparable to that of \nosteoporosis  in women  30 years ago [8]. In the setting  of \u201cred flags\u201d (see Appendix  1), the initial evaluation  of a \npainful  VCF  includes  assessing  any neurologic  deficits  and evaluating  mechanical  versus radicular  pain.  \nSubsequently,  imaging  of the affected  spinal  segment  is performed  to characterize  the fracture  and to determine the \nextent  of disease.  In a meta -analysis of more  than 2 million  patients,  those  with osteoporotic  VCFs who underwent  \nvertebral  augmentation (VA)  were 22% less likely  to die at up to 10 years after treatment  than those  who received  \nnonsurgical  treatment  [9].", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ade99d6a-b554-4772-ae84-ff28c6857c16": {"__data__": {"id_": "ade99d6a-b554-4772-ae84-ff28c6857c16", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "ACR management of vertebral compression fracture.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d0aae793-fc9a-4b0d-af59-19093053dce0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "ACR management of vertebral compression fracture.pdf"}, "hash": "2dce81f9900254b02d60d74bdea5124f242d501e71a8767e04a4613eabf23c38"}, "2": {"node_id": "04a660b7-b4ff-4bd5-9426-04751ace6291", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "ACR management of vertebral compression fracture.pdf"}, "hash": "ee1877b111b472c57639f58d1f984d808cd968e7b0931b95623391d22f618a3a"}}, "hash": "3150fe23aad468859df5a97e070a1e5d12f817f33ddc7cd6c212a534ce0ab3b5", "text": "Subsequently,  imaging  of the affected  spinal  segment  is performed  to characterize  the fracture  and to determine the \nextent  of disease.

Hirsch  et al [10] analyzed  the Medicare database for the number  needed  to treat to save \none life at 1 year and up to 5 years after VA and showed  that VA conferred  a significant  mortality  benefit  over \nnonsurgical  management  with the adjusted  number  needed  to treat to save one life for nonsurgical  management  \nversus kyphoplasty ranged  from  14.8 at year 1 to 11.9 at year 5. The adjusted  number  needed  to treat for nonsurgical  \nmanagement  versus vertebroplasty  (VP)  ranged  from  22.8 at year 1 to 23.8 at year 5. \nNeoplasms causing  VCF s include  1) primary  benign bone  neoplasms,  such as hemangioma  (aggressive type)  or \ngiant  cell tumors  [11], and tumor -like conditions  causing  bony and cellular  remodeling,  such as aneurysmal  bone  \ncysts,  or Paget  disease (osteitis  deformans) ; 2) primary  malignant  neoplasms including  but not limited  to multiple  \nmyeloma  and lymphoma ; and 3) metastatic  neoplasms  [2,12,13].

However , it should be noted that treatment  can vary depending on tumor  type.  \nVCF s secondary  to underlying malignant  or metastatic disease can result  in skeletal -related  events,  including bone  \npain,  pathologic  vertebral  fractures,  and epidural  spinal  cord compression.  The pathologic  vertebral  fractures may \nalso have  associated  mechanical  instability. The Spine  Oncology Study  Group (SOSG)  has developed the Spinal \nInstability  Neoplastic Score (SINS) to evaluate spinal  stability . One of the categories within  SINS  is the presence  \nof a pathologic  VCF.  The rating  is a composite of clinical  and radiographic  data, including location, pain,  bone  \nquality,  alignment, vertebral  body collapse,  and posterolateral  involvement.  The affected  spinal  segment  can be \nclassified  as stable (0\u20136), potentially  unstable  (7\u201312), and unstable  (13\u201318). The SINS  is routinely  used by \noncologic  spine  surgeons  and spine  radiation  oncologists  and has excellent  interobserver  and intraobserver  \nreliability  [14]. SINS  has also been  shown  in clinical  studies to be a tool enabling  the prediction of VCF  or the \nprogression of an existing  VCF  postradiation  [15]. A radiographic  grading  system  for metastatic  epidural  spinal  \ncord compression  developed by the SOSG  can also be used to guide  management  [16]. \nSpecial  Treatment  Considerations \nVA is a generic term that includes  percutaneous  VP, balloon-assisted  kyphoplasty (BK) [2], and other  implantable  \nmethods  of VA [17-20].  These procedures,  the majority  of which  are described  in the lumbar  and thoracic spine,  \nare used for the palliation  of pain related  to VCF s and have  been  shown  to be effective compared  to medical  \nmanagement  [13,21-23]. \nMany  studies have  compared  VP to BK [24-30]  and the appropriate  timing  of VA [21-23 ,31-34 ]. A thorough  \ndescription  of the indications  and contraindications  to VA is detailed  in the ACR \u2013ASNR \u2013ASSR \u2013SIR\u2013 SNIS  \nPractice Parameter  for the Performance  of Vertebral  Augm entation  [35]. Because the clinical  outcome  studies show  \nessentially  the same benefit  of BK as VP for patient  pain relief  and mobility  and similar  complication  rates,  a \nmultisociety  panel  of spine  interventionalist holds  the position  that BK or VP may be considered  to be useful  and \ngenerally  interchangeable  techniques  for the performance of VA.

The benefits  \nof MRI for preprocedural  planning have  been  reported  [43-45] . Minimally  deforming fractures that may not be well \nseen on conventional  radiographs  may be better  detected  on preprocedure  MRI,  mainly  if the imaging  evaluation  is \n>3 months  since the suspected  injury  or if there is a change  in symptoms  from  the initial workup [43,46]. Fluid -\nsensitive MRI sequences (short  tau inversion  recovery  or fat-saturated  T2-weighted  imaging)  help detect  and \ndifferentiate  acute/subacute versus chronic  fractures,  identifying  fracture clefts,  and differentiating  synchronous  \nfractures [46,47]. MRI is also valuable  for distinguishing  recent  from  chronic  vertebral  fractures in patients  with \nmultiple  vertebral  fractures  and diffuse  back  pain, which  can at times  confound the clinical  examination  [48,49]. \nHowever,  vertebral  body edema  is not a precise measure of compression  fracture  age because  the duration  after an \nosteoporotic  compression  fracture  is often  not known  with certainty.  Bone  marrow  edema typically  resolves within  \n1 to 3 months  [50,51]. IV contrast  is not useful  because it does not add information in the setting  of recent  \nosteoporotic  VCF . \nBone  Scan  Whole  Body  \nTc-99m  whole -body bone  scan (bone  scintigraphy)  may be helpful  to determine the painful  vertebrae [52],  \nparticularly  the causative level  [53,54].

When  more  than one area of increased  activity  is detected,  bone  \nscans may overestimate the number  of acute fractures.

The presence of lobulated paraspinal  masses with \ninvolvement  of both vertebral  body and posterior  elements at the same time favors  malignant  involvement  [66]. \nDual -energy  CT may show  bone  marrow  edema with reasonably  high sensitivity  and specificity  [40,41] and good  \nconcordance  to MRI in thoracolumbar  VCFs [42]. The presence of intravertebral  vacuum  phenomenon favors  a \nbenign etiology  [67]. IV contrast  does not provide  additional value  in this clinical scenario.  \nCT Myelography Spine  Area  of Interest  \nCT myelography of the spine  may be useful  in patients  in this clinical  scenario  because it can delineate the degree  \nof thecal  sac compression . Myelography is also obtained in patients  with previous  metal  hardware to evaluate  \nepidural  disease and to accurately  delineate the spinal  cord for preirradiation  treatment  planning.  \nMRI Spine  Area  of Interest  \nMRI may provide  valuable  information  to differentiate  malignant  from  benign VCFs . Neoplastic VCFs often  have  \na total replacement  of the normally  high T1 bone  marrow  signal  intensity, resulting  in diffuse  homogeneous  low \nsignal  intensity . In osteoporosis,  the underlying mechanism  leading  to fracture  is the loss of bone  mineral  density  \nwith preservation  of the marrow  [68]. Abnormal  marrow  signal  involving  the pedicles or other  posterior  elements  \nis a strong indicator  of malignancy in VCFs because tumor  spread  to the posterior  elements typically  occurs  before  \ntumor -associated  structural  instability  leads to fracture  within  the vertebral  body [65,69]. Although osteoporotic  \nfractures can also have  edema  in the pedicles related  to stress  reaction,  they infrequently have  signal  change  in the \nposterior  elements [65,69]. Abnormal  epidural or paravertebral  soft tissue is another  imaging  finding  suggesting  a \npathologic  VCF  with convex retropulsion of the posterior  cortex  [70]. A bilobed  appearance in the ventral  extradural  \nspace is more  commonly  seen in neoplastic disease,  as opposed to nonneoplastic  disease,  in which  there is \npreservation  of the strong attachment  of the central  sagittal septum  [71]. Fluid -sensitive  MRI sequences (short tau \ninversion recovery  or fat-saturated  T2-weighted  imaging)  can help detect  fracture  clefts and identify  synchronous  \nfractures [46,47]. IV contrast  may yield  beneficial  information  with increased  homogenous  and heterogenous  \nenhancement  patterns seen more  in neoplastic fractures  with or without  associated  enhancing paraspinal  soft tissues.  \nEnhancement  involving  the posterior  elements raises the suspicion  for malignancy  further [66].  Diffusion and \nperfusion imaging  are also used to help differentiate  benign  from  malignant  compression  fractures with low \napparent diffusion coefficient  values and increased  perfusion parameters,  suggesting neoplastic over benign \ninvolvement  [66]. \nBone  Scan  Whole  Body  \nTc-99m  whole -body bone  scan (bone  scintigraphy)  may be helpful  to determine the painful  vertebrae [52] and also \nto evaluate other  areas of metastases because of complete skeletal  coverage,  especially  in a patient with a history  of \nmalignancy  [53,54,58].

However,  18F-NaF  PET/CT is a highly  sensitive method in evaluating  bone  metastases  \n(eg, prostate cancer).

MRI  features  coupled with clinical  symptoms  may help discern  the etiology of a VCF  with increased  FDG \nuptake  [101].  A meta-analysis study showed  high sensitivity  and moderate specificity  for FDG-PET/CT to \ndifferentiate  malignant  versus benign  VCFs [73]. Other  potential  radiotracers have  been  described  for the early  \ndetection  of marrow -based  metastases,  such as 18F-NaF  PET/CT,  which  indicate s areas of increased  bone  turnover  \nand is generally  used in the assessment  of primary  and secondary  osseous  malignancies,  the evaluation  of response  \nto treatment,  and the clarification  of abnormalities  on other  imaging  modalities  or clinical  data.  However,  18F-NaF  \nPET/CT is a highly  sensitive method in evaluating  bone  metastases  (eg, prostate cancer) . Still, it can be problematic \nbecause of low specificity  because the tracer  accumulates in degenerative and inflammatory  bone  diseases.  18F-\nfluorocholine  may be able to differentiate between  degenerative and malignant  osseous abnormalities  because  \ndegenerative changes are not choline -avid  [74]. \nImage -Guided Biopsy  Spine  Area  of Interest  \nIf the imaging  features are ambiguous  and not definitely  in keeping  with a pathologic  VCF,  a biopsy  can be \nperformed  to verify  the etiology .

Because VCFs are flexion -compression  injuries, a hyperextension brace is used.  These braces  may be \nbeneficial  for the first few months  until the pain resolves [101].

However,  there is a very small  subgroup of patients  who have  no pain \nrelief  or even  worsening pain after the VA, perhaps  indicat ing continued progression of the treated  fracture  or \ndevelopment  of a new fracture  at the previously treated  site. The causes of failure  of the initial VA procedure  include  \ninadequate  filling  of the fracture  site and persistent  or increasing  intravertebral  fluid -filled  clefts.  The presence of \nan unfilled  intravertebral  fluid  cleft on preoperative  diagnostic  studies is an important  indicator  of risk for \nprogression,  as is the later development  of fluid  at the bone  cement  interface.

Approximately 1 in 5 patients  with osteoporotic  VCFs will \ndevelop chronic  back  pain as a result  of the fracture  [105, 106].

Certain  newer  variants of VA have  been  \nshown  to be comparable to standard  methods,  such as BK, in decreasing  pain scores and functional  improvement  \n[17].  VCFs following  SBRT  are also amenable to VA. Typically  followed  VA procedure  patients  should still be \nconsidered  for radiation.  \nSurgical Consultation \nSurgery  is the standard  of care for pathologic  VCF  complicated  by frank  spinal  instability  and/or neurologic  deficits.  \nThe SINS  can be used to categorize the metastatic  spinal  segment  as stable,  potentially  unstable,  or unstable  based  \non anatomic and clinical  factors [150] and can guide  surgical  referral  [14,150]. In the setting  of metastatic spinal  \ncord compression,  mainly  because of osseous  compression,  surgery  is more  likely  to allow  recovery  compared  to \nRT alone  [151]. Observational  studies suggest  that surgical  decompression,  tumor  excision , and stabilization  \nimprove  neurological  status from  nonambulatory to ambulatory and provide  pain relief  [137]. Decomp ressive \nsurgery  followed  by RT may benefit  symptomatic  spinal  cord compression  in patients  who are <65 years  of age, in \nthe setting  of a single  level  of compression,  in patients with neurologic  deficits  for <48 hours,  and in those  patients  \nwith a predicted  survival  of at least 3 months  [152]. The combination of a spine  stabilization  procedure  and RT may \nalso help manage axial  pain and aid in neurologic  recovery  [153] . \nA large prospective randomized  trial shows that patients with metastatic epidural  spinal  cord compression  treated  \nwith direct  decompressive  surgery  plus postoperative  radiotherapy retain  the ability  to walk  for longer  and regain  \nthe ability  more  often  than patients  treated  with radiotherapy  alone.  Surgery  allows most  patients  to remain  \nambulatory for the remainder  of their lives,  whereas patients  treated  with radiation  alone  spend  a substantial  \nproportion  of their remaining  time paraplegic.  Surgical  treatment  also results in increased  survival  time. The better  \nsurvival  time in the surgical  group was probably because  a greater  proportion of patients in this group were  \nambulatory and remained  so for longer  than those  in the radiation  group.  Therefore,  patients  in the surgery  group \nwere less susceptible to infections,  blood clots,  and other  problems  that result  in the death  of paraplegic patients.  \nSurgical  treatment  also reduces the need  for corticosteroids and opioid  pain relief  [154]. Palliative  surgery  using  \nposterior  decompression  and fixation  combined  with intraoperative  VA to treat spinal  metastases with osseous  and \nepidural  disease can improve  neurological  function,  alleviate  pain effectively,  and allow  low cement  leakage and \ntimely  disposal  of leakage if it happens  [155].  \nRadiation Oncology Consultation \nThe current  standard  of care for the management  of diffuse  painful  osseous metastases is external  beam  RT [156] \nfor at least partial pain palliation  [157].

Some  studies have  demonstrated  benefit  in \nup to 70% of patients  treated  with respect  to neurologic  improvement  for patients with symptomatic  spinal  cord \ncompression  [158, 159]. Advancements  in radiotherapy have  allowed  for the delivery  of high precision  dose-\nescalated  treatment , known  as SBRT , to targets throughout  the body with excellent  local  control  rates.  Recently,  \nthe first phase II randomized  trial comparing conventional  radiotherapy to comprehensive  SBRT  of oligometastatic  \ndisease demonstrated  an overall  survival  and progression -free  survival  advantage  [160].  The spine  is a common site \nof metastasis and a complex site for SBRT  given the adjacent  spinal  cord and the tumor  embedded within  the bone  \ntissue putting  the patient  at risk of fracture  [161].  SBRT  delivers precise,  high-dose  radiation  to the target  region  \nwhile  sparing  the spinal  cord and provides  satisfactory  efficacy  and an acceptable safety  profile  for spinal  \nmetastases.  A recent  landmark  randomized  phase 3 trial led by Sahgal  et al [162] showed  that SBRT  delivering  24 \nGy in 2 fractions was superior  to conventional  radiotherapy delivering  20 Gy in 5 fraction s for patients  with limited  \npainful  spinal  metastases.  They  reported  an 11% risk of VCF  in the SBRT  arm and superior  complete response rates  \nfor pain at 3 and 6 months  posttreatment  with SBRT  [162].  \nNo comparative randomized trials  have  been  performed  to establish  optimal dosing of spine  SBRT.  Single -fraction  \nSBRT  may result  in a higher  local  control  rate than those  of the other  fractionations , particularly  with 24 Gy in 1 \nfraction . However,  high-dose  single  fraction  SBRT  comes at the expense of a greater  rate of vertebral  fracture , \nwhich  can even  approximate  40% [96].  At present,  the dose of spine  SBRT  varies from  18 to 24 Gy in 1 fraction,  \n24 Gy in 2 fractions,  and 24 to 40 Gy in 3 to 5 fractions [95]. A study by Chen  et al [163] using normal  tissue  \ncomplication  probability modeling suggests that the larger  volume  of the vertebral  segment  receiving  lower  doses  \nis more  closely  associated  with post-SBRT  VCF  than high dose regions , and technical  developments  in spine  SBRT", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "54f2d71b-1f08-4294-9a03-0b780ca6b9de": {"__data__": {"id_": "54f2d71b-1f08-4294-9a03-0b780ca6b9de", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "ACR management of vertebral compression fracture.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9a0c1c58-0809-45a3-ab05-2b2ec0aebbb8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "ACR management of vertebral compression fracture.pdf"}, "hash": "ce01b0826e11adc8bae7ba9f1bdf5c990eaf698b53dfcaafde7c34eb447093b6"}, "3": {"node_id": "10f132e1-33b3-40ca-b5d9-5cef513fedfc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "ACR management of vertebral compression fracture.pdf"}, "hash": "95929d2d12f464c911802a62aab7e0079c9f601dbb6339ecbe59f837abd3d1f2"}}, "hash": "a754f460c355f753030002d7f599e23cfa9fa400c1f4344d0854c48c8dae1129", "text": "ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 17 Vertebral Compression Fractures  continue  to evolve  with respect  to mitigating  the risk of iatrogenic  fracture .

Radioisotopes  are effective in providing pain relief  1 to 4 weeks  \nafter initiation, with response rates of between  40% and 95% that can continue  for up to 18 months.  For example,  \na prospective study on the palliative  efficacy  of strontium -89 showed  an overall  response rate of 76% and a complete  \nresponse rate of 32% [167]. Repeat  doses are effective in providing pain relief  in many  patients.  The combination  \nwith chemotherapeutic agents,  such as cisplatin,  can increase the effectiveness of radioisotopes.

Timpone,  MDp; Amanda S. Corey,  MD.q \nSummary  of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nMyelopathy  refers to any pathologic  process affecting  the spinal  cord. It is a clinical  diagnosis  based  on signs  and \nsymptoms  of spinal  cord dysfunction  [1]. Myelopathy can be due to primary  intrinsic  disorders  of the spinal  cord \nand include  neoplastic,  infectious , inflammatory, neurodegenerative,  vascular,  nutritional, and idiopathic  disorders \n[2]. More  commonly,  however,  myelopathy is due to secondary conditions,  which  result  in extrinsic  compression  \nof the spinal  cord.  The most  frequently encountered  cause of extrinsic  compression  of the spinal  cord in adults  is \ndegenerative disease  of the cervical  and thoracic spine  [3]. Other  causes of myelopathy from  external  spinal  cord \ncompression  include  bone  metastases and blunt  or penetrating  trauma . A variety  of cysts and benign neoplasms can \nalso compress the cord;  they tend to arise within  the intradu ral compartment . The most  common of these are nerve  \nsheath  tumors,  meningiomas,  and arachnoid  adhesions/ cysts [4-10]. \nClinically, the diagnosis  of myelopathy depends  on the localization  of the neurological  finding to the spinal  cord, \nrather  than the brain  or peripheral  nervous  system,  and then to a particular  segment  of the spinal  cord [11]. Although \nthe causes of myelopathy may be many , the acuity  of presentation  and symptom  onset  provides  the clinical  team  \nwith a practical  approach  to the differential  diagnosis  [1,12] . Myelopathy is considered  acute  if symptoms  begin  \nabruptly  or have  an onset  of days to weeks.  Myelopathy with a time course of months  to years is considered  chronic  \nor progressive.  \nImaging plays  a crucial  role in refining  the differential  diagnosis . Historically, radiological  evaluation  of \nmyelopathic  patients  consisted  of positive  contrast  myelography.  Later,  this evaluation  was supplemented  by CT \nand CT myelography.  MRI  is now the mainstay  in the evaluation  of myelopathy because of its superb  contrast  \nresolution  of the spinal  cord [10,13-15] . \nFor the purposes  of this discussion,  myelopathy secondary  to trauma  is excluded  (see the ACR Appropriateness  \nCriteria\u00ae topic  on \u201cSuspected  Spine  Trauma \u201d [16]). \nSpecial Imaging  Considerations  \nAlthough history and physical  exam ination  can help localize the myelopathic  level,  it may be beneficial  to study  \nthe entire  spine , even  in the setting  of a localized  myelopathic  level.  In certain  cases,  brain  MRI may be a useful  \nadjunct  diagnostic  test [17].", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe568a82-a1df-457e-acd8-36f9ba324dc0": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe568a82-a1df-457e-acd8-36f9ba324dc0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "ACR myelopathy.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e738607-66b2-4e65-8c7f-5625c1dfe153", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "ACR myelopathy.pdf"}, "hash": "b7ed784249d9c367f870bf0ac9db53644938e93a02a202b096f4bd2dba06bead"}, "2": {"node_id": "95d7c728-0a59-4802-841a-6aa73893b1ae", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "ACR myelopathy.pdf"}, "hash": "027e81033ad5f01d8c600b3acf860f2be5516a8e04544edd6faa93dcc4aa6ff0"}}, "hash": "9b766d95739eb08f166713dfc51465138f1abbca10c924d474caf1cee3ca6098", "text": "Special Imaging  Considerations  \nAlthough history and physical  exam ination  can help localize the myelopathic  level,  it may be beneficial  to study  \nthe entire  spine , even  in the setting  of a localized  myelopathic  level.

Initial imaging.  \nThe body regions  covered  in this clinical  scenario  are cervical,  thoracic,  and lumbar  spine.  These body regions  \nmight  be evaluated  separately  or in combination as guided by physical  examination  findings,  patient  history, and \nother  available information , including prior  imaging.  \nAcute myelopathy can be subdivided into noninflammatory and inflammatory  causes.  Noninflammatory conditions  \ninclude  extrinsic  compression  of the spinal  cord, vascular  pathologies , and trauma . Inflammatory  conditions  include  \ndemyelinating  diseases (ie, multiple  sclerosis) , systemic inflammatory  diseases,  and infection.  \nFor the purposes  of this discussion,  myelopathy secondary  to trauma  is excluded  (see the ACR Appropriateness  \nCriteria\u00ae topic  on \u201cSuspected  Spine  Trauma \u201d [16]). Vertebral  fracture  in the setting  of weakened  bone  (eg, \nosteoporotic  or pathologic  fracture)  with retropulsion  can lead to myelopathy,  even  in minor  trauma  or no obvious  \nhistory  of trauma  (see the ACR  Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae topic  on \u201cManagement  of Vertebral  Compression  \nFractures \u201d [23]).  \nAll patients  with acute onset  myelopathy require  evaluation  for extrinsic  compression  of the spinal  cord [3]. In the \nacute setting, extrinsic  compression  of the spinal  cord is most  commonly caused  by degenerative disease  \n(spondylotic  myelopathy)  and is more  prevalent  in the cervical  spine.  Factors contributing  to spondylotic  \nmyelopathy include  spinal  degenerative changes,  disc herniations,  and malalignment . These findings  may be \naccentuated  in the presence of congenitally  short  pedicles.  Other  causes of extrinsic  compression of the spinal  cord \ninclude  pathology involving the epidural  compartment  (abscess or hematoma)  [24]. In patients  who have  undergone  \nspinal  surgery,  extrinsic  compression  of the spinal  cord can develop throughout  the postoperative  course and may \nbe secondary  to seromas,  pseudomeningoceles,  hematomas,  and/or epidural  abscesses [25]. Primary  or metastatic  \ntumors  of the extradural  and intradural  extramedullary  spaces encroaching  upon  the spinal  canal  can cause extrinsic  \ncompression  of the spinal  cord, resulting  in not only acute but also progressive  myelopathy (see Variant  2).

Other  pathologies  that may predispose  \npatients  to developing spinal  cord ischemia include  systemic hypotension,  thoracoabdominal  aneurysms or \ndissection , sickle cell disease,  and spinal  arteriovenous  malformations  (AVM s) [27,28] . Very  rarely,  patients  may \ndevelop hematomyelia and subsequently acute myelopathy because of an intrameduallary  AVM  or spinal  artery  \naneurysm  rupture  [29,30] . Acute ischemic myelopathy can also develop in the setting  of fibrocartilaginous  embolic  \ndisease [31]. Depending on the level(s)  of the spinal  cord involved,  patients  will typically  develop acute paraparesis \nor quadriparesis.

Beaman, MD.l \nSummary  of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nOsteonecrosis is defined  as bone  death  due to inadequate  vascular  supply.  Although exact  pathophysiology is \nunknown,  3 possible  mechanisms have been  proposed:  1) vascular  interruption , 2) vascular  occlusion , or 3) \nextravascular  intraosseous  compression,  most  likely  caused by  lipid hypertrophy [1]. It is sometimes also called \n\u201cavascular  necrosis\u201d and \u201caseptic necrosis\u201d when  involving epiphysis  or \u201cbone  infarct\u201d when  involving  \nmeta diaphysis  and will be addressed  in this document  as \u201costeonecrosis. \u201d Common sites include  the femoral  head,  \nhumeral  head,  tibial metadiaphysis,  femoral  metadiaphysis,  scaphoid,  lunate,  and talus  [2,3] . \nOsteonecrosis is thought  to be a common condition most  commonly affecting  adults  in third  to fifth decades of life, \nwith femoral head  osteonecrosis incidence reported  to be 10,000 to 20,000 new symptomatic  cases  per year in the \nUnited  States  [4,5] . True  prevalence of osteonecrosis is likely  quite  underestimated  because many  patients  are \nasymptomatic,  especially  the meta diaphyseal  cases.  Recent  studies  have  shown  that MR-proven cases of femoral  \nosteonecrosis  can be retrospectively  visualized  on CT abdomen/pelvis  with intravenous  (IV) contrast  performed  for \nother  clinical  purposes  and were originally  vastly  underreported [6,7] . Risk factors for osteonecrosis are numerous  \nand include  trauma,  corticosteroid  therapy,  alcohol  use, HIV,  lymphoma/leukemia,  blood dyscrasias,  chemo therapy,  \nradiation  therapy , Gaucher  disease,  and Caisson  disease [8-10]. In nontraumatic  cases,  femoral  head  osteonecrosis  \nis often  bilateral (70%-80%)  [5]. Other  locations  of osteonecrosis  (eg, talus,  humeral  head)  are often  involved in \ncases of multifocal osteonecrosis [11,12] . In a long-term  follow -up of patients  on steroids,  Nawata et al [12] found \nosteonecrosis  in the hip (68%),  knee  (44%),  ankle  (17%),  and shoulder  (15%) . \nEpiphyseal  osteonecrosis can lead to subchondral  fracture and secondary  osteoarthritis , whereas metadiaphyseal  \ncases do not, likely  explaining their lack of long-term  sequelae [5,10] . The necrotic volume  of epiphyseal  \nosteonecrosis  has been  shown  to be predictive  of future  articular  collapse.  Femoral  heads with necrotic volume  \n>30% progress ed to collapse in 46% to 83% of cases,  in contrast  to femoral  heads  with <30%  in necrotic volume , \nwhich  progressed  to collapse in <5%  of cases  [13].", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "11963ff2-8415-46f7-8a24-31fe04cf52c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "11963ff2-8415-46f7-8a24-31fe04cf52c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "ACR osteonecrosis.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1b0b00f3-c6b9-442a-8b55-da1c499f82e5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "ACR osteonecrosis.pdf"}, "hash": "3031d5072a8af4573c9442687a3b255057478659995be2905712f723fe5aa1d6"}, "2": {"node_id": "7e240613-779d-4f8b-948f-478e62414d9f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "ACR osteonecrosis.pdf"}, "hash": "8bd4b2f93594669bcae3f3c641c8d3a0ed08b8bccea52b2eaa3531b19d4aa156"}}, "hash": "6c744fc3c8f568d3cc72831f0ac341303bbe3745f2c63f77d98705d6c138638f", "text": "The necrotic volume  of epiphyseal  \nosteonecrosis  has been  shown  to be predictive  of future  articular  collapse.

Similarly, the necrotic volume  in the humeral  head  can be \nmeasured  via necrotic angle  (mid -coronal  plane  measurement  of the extent  of osteonecrosis spanning the humeral  \nhead,  typically  involving  the superomedial  aspect).  Humeral  heads  with a necrotic angle  <90\u00b0 did not collapse in \nthe subsequent  24 months  follow -up [14]. In addition,  the increased  risk for femoral  head  collapse has been  \nassociated  with increased  joint effusion,  increased  bone  marrow  edema  about  the focus  of osteonecrosis,  patient  \nage >40 years , and increased  body mass index (\u226524 kg/m)  [5]. \nEarly  diagnosis  of osteonecrosis is important  1) to exclude  other  causes of patient\u2019s  pain and 2) to allow  for possible \nearly  surgical  prevention to prevent  articular  collapse and the need  for joint replacements.

They  include  statin s, \nbisphosphonate s, anticoagulant s, extracorporeal  shock  wave therapy,  and hyperbaric  oxygen [16-18]. \nInvasive  therapies for early  osteonecrosis aim at preventing articular  collapse and delaying/preventing the need  for \njoint replacement.

Core  decompression  can be supplemented  with injection  of autologous  bone  marrow  cells, vascular  \nfibular  grafting,  or electric stimulatio n. However,  overall  efficacy  of core decompression  at preventing eventual  \narticular  collapse remains  controversial  [11,19-22] . For late-stage femoral  or humeral  head  osteonecrosis with \narticular  collapse,  resurfacing  hemiarthroplasty  may be needed , whereas total joint arthroplasty  is performed  in \ncases of severe secondary  osteoarthritis  [23].

This document addresses tumors and tumor -like conditions that occur primarily in \nbone and specifically excludes metastatic involvement of bone from both musculoskeletal and \nnonmusculoskeletal primary malignancies , such as lymphoma or plasma cell myeloma that may present as a \nsolitary osseous lesion. Primary bone tumors exclusively seen in the pediatri c population are also excluded.  \nPrimary bone tumors are conventionally classified by the World Health Organization  as benign, intermediate \n(locally aggressive or rarely metastasizing),  or malignant  [1]. Benign tumors include a wide variety of \ndevelopmental abnormalities and true neoplasms.  Because most benign bone tumors are asymptomatic, the true \nincidence of these tumors is unknown , although they are not uncommon.  Intermediate tumors include lesions such  \nas giant cell tumor, osteoblastoma,  and desmoplastic fibroma. Primary malignant bone tumors may also arise \nfrom malignant mesenchymal cells (sarcomas).  Primary malignant bone tumors are quite rare , with an estimated \nincidence of 1 case per 100,000 persons  per year  [2]. \nDiagnosis of benign and malignant primary bone tumors relies on a coordinated evaluation of both clinical and \nradiologic information. Many primary bone tumors can be effectively stratified with respect to typical age of \npresentation as well as lesion size, location , and number.  Classically, radiographs have played a substantial role in \nthe characterization of primary bone tumors. An  assortment of radiographic features, including tumor margin, \nperiosteal reaction , and matrix mineralization, may be used to assess the biological activity of a bone lesion [3-6]. \nAn asymptomatic nonaggressive-appearing lesion incidentally found on radiographs may, in many cases, require \nno further evaluation. In cases in which  clinical or  radiographic features are indeterminate or additional anatomic \ninformation is required, advanced imaging modalities , such as CT, MRI, or nuclear  medicine, may p rovide a \ncomplementary role in the diagnosis and treatment stratification of primary bone tumors.  \nBecause primary bone sarcomas are rare , there is sparse level 1 evidence in the literature specifically addressing \ntheir imaging evaluation.  The recommendations contain ed herein are based on assessment of the available \nliterature and on the experience of the members of the ACR Appropriateness Criteria Expert Panel on \nMusculoskeletal Imaging . \nThis document  applies to the evaluation of osseous lesions throughout the entire body. Generally, bone tumors are \nmost common in the long bones [1], and consequently, recommendations for imaging are for the most part based \non this. When lesions occur in locations with complex osseous anatomy , such as the skull, spine, pelvis, or small \nbones of the hand or foot, CT may be a more suitable initial ima ging modality.

Initial imaging . \nCT Area of Interest  \nCT is not routinely used in the initial evaluation of primary bone tumors. There is no relevant literature regarding \nthe use of CT in the initial imaging of primary bone tumors.  \nFDG-PET/CT Whole Body  \nPET using the tracer fluorine -18-2 -fluoro -2-deoxy-D -glucose (FDG)/CT is not routinely used in the initial \nevaluation of primary bone tumors. There is no relevant literature regarding the use of FDG- PET/CT in the initial \nimaging of prima ry bone tumors.  \nMRI Area of Interest  \nMRI is not routinely used in the initial evaluation of primary bone tumors. There is no relevant literature \nregarding the use of MRI in the initial imaging of primary bone tumors.  \nRadiography Area of Interest  \nRadiographs remain the most appropriate imaging modality for screening and initial characterization of primary \nbone tumors. Radiographs provide an accurate  means by which to evaluate primary bone tumors. Radiographs \neffectively provide information in regar d to tumor location, size, and shape , as well as evidence of tumor \nbiological activity [ 3]. Tumor margin and periosteal reaction  provide a reliable index of biological potential of the \ntumor , whereas matrix, if identified, is a key to the underlying histology  [3-6]. Although the  utility of radiographs \nin stratifying bone lesions by biological activity  is w ell established, there is sparse literature documenting \nconcrete values on accuracy.  A prospective study evaluating 200 consecutive bone tumors of the hand showed \nthat subjective grading of tumors based on radiographic features provided a correct categorization of tumor grade \n(benign versus malignant) in 82.5% of cases [7]. In a retrospective study applying a modified Lodwick-Madewell \ngrading system to categorize 183 bone tumors, Caracciolo et al  [8] found that a low radiographic grade \nassignment correlates with benignity and that increasing grad e correlates with an increasing  risk of malignancy . It \nshould be noted that accurate radiographic characterization of some primary bone tumors (such as low -grade \ncartilage lesions) is  inherently difficult because of  overlapping radiographic features of some benign and \nmalignant chondroid lesions . Crim et al [ 9] performed a retrospective review of 53 cases of low -grade  cartilage \nlesions (enchondroma and grade 1 chondrosarcoma) and found that radiographs suggested the correct diagnosis of \nenchondroma in 67.2% of cases and the correct diagnosis of chondrosarcoma in only 20.8% of cases . In a \nretrospective analysis of 35 enchondromas and 43 central grade 1 chondrosarcomas, Geirnaerdt et al [10] found \nthat m orphologic features seen on radiographs in combination with clinical symptoms did  not improve the ability \nto differentiate between enchondromas and central grade 1 chondrosarcomas.  \nBone Scan Whole B ody \nBone scan is not routinely used in the initial evaluation of primary bone tumors. There is no relevant literature \nregarding the use of Tc -99m bone scan in the initial imaging of primary bone tumors.  \nUS Area of Interest  \nUltrasound ( US) is not routinely used in the initial evaluation of primary bone tumors. There is no relevant \nliterature regarding the use of US  in the initial imaging  of primary bone tumors.  \nVariant 2:  Suspect primary bone tumor.

CT is also a viable imaging alternative for patients \nwho cannot receive an MRI.  Some cases may benefit from both MRI and CT because these modalities provide \ncomple mentary  information regarding soft -tissue (often better evaluated on MR I) and matrix mineralization (often \nbetter evaluated on CT).  \nThere is no relevant literature specifically regarding the use of CT with intravenous ( IV) contrast or CT without \nand with IV contrast  in the evaluation of suspected primary bone tumor with negative or equivocal radiographs or \nradiographs that do not explain symptoms.  Contrast may be helpful i f a soft -tissue component is suspected. \nHowever, if contrast is given, CT without and with IV contrast is preferred be cause it allows differentiati on of \nareas of contrast enhancement from areas of osseous matrix production.  \nFDG -PET/CT Whole Body  \nFDG-PET/CT is not routinely used for the evaluation of primary bone tumors in patients with positive localized \nor regional symptoms and negative radiographs or findings that do not explain symptoms . Although FDG-\nPET/CT can detect metabolically active tumors, there is no relevant literature regarding the use of FDG-PET/CT \nin patients with positive localized or regional symptoms and negative radiographs or findings that do not explain \nsymptoms.  \nMRI Area of Interest  \nAlthough there is no relevant literature specifically regarding the general use of MRI in this setting, the excellent \nsoft-tissue characterization afforded by MRI facilitates detection of radiographically  occult pathology within both \nthe bone and the surrounding tissues. In addition to its ability to detect occult bone tumors, MRI can identify other \nradiographically  occult abnormalities , such as osseous contusion, developing stress fracture, infection, or regional \nsoft-tissue injury , that may account f or the patient\u2019s symptoms. There is evidence that MRI is superior to bone \nscan [12] as detailed in the bone scan section below. For these reasons, MRI is consi dered the study of choice in \npatients with suspected bone tumor that is due to positive symptoms but negative radiographs. Although contrast \nmay be especially useful in biopsy planning and assessment of response to therapy, it is not always required.  \nBone Scan Whole Body  \nDespite its historical utility in detecting radiographically  occult bone abnormalities, studies that are more recent  \nhave shown that MRI is superior in this role. A retrospective analysis comparing the sensitivity of MRI and \nscintigraphy in the detection of malignant bone tumors in 106 patients showed that MRI revealed a focal \nabnormality compatible with tumor that was occult on scintigraphy in 28% of cases [12]. Although not typically \nthe next imaging study , bone scan remains a viable imaging option in select cases in which  MRI is not clinically \nfeasible as well as in cases that require evaluation of  the full extent and distribution of disease  because  it can \nprovide a comprehensive evaluation of  the entire skeleton.  \nUS Area of Interest  \nAlthough  US may be helpful in detecting regional soft -tissue abnormalities that could explain symptoms, US is \nquite limited in its ability to evaluate bone. There is no relevant literature regarding the use of US for the \nevaluation of primary bone tumors in patients with positive localized or regional symptoms and negative \nradiographs or findings that do not explain symptoms.  \nVariant 3:  Suspect primary bone tumor. Benign radiographic features. Not osteoid osteoma. Next imaging \nstudy. \nAn asymptomatic benign-appearin g lesion on radiographs is usually an incidental finding and typically requires \nno further imaging evaluation.

CT is pre ferred over \nMRI when osteoid osteoma is strongly suspected because it is extremely sensitive for detection and precise \ndelineation of the  nidus [14], which is important both for diagnosis and treatment . In a study including 19 patients \nwith histologically proven  osteoid osteoma who underwent CT and MRI before excision of the lesion, Assoun et \nal [15] found that CT was more accurate than MRI in detection of the osteoid osteoma nidus in 63% of cases .  \nThere is no relevant literature specifically regarding the use of CT without and with  IV contrast in the evaluation \nof suspected primary bone tumor with negative or equivocal radiographs or radiographs that do not explain \nsymptoms.  However, if contrast is given, CT without and with IV contrast is preferred because it allows \ndifferentiation of areas of contrast enhancement from areas of osseous matrix production.  \nCT perfusion  is a dynamic without and with IV contrast CT examination, which f acilitates further characterization \nin the setting of suspected osteoid osteoma.  A comparative study looking at CT perfusion parameters of 15 \npatients with a final diagnosis of osteoid osteoma, 15 patients with lesions that mimic osteoid osteomas,  and 26 \npatients with other bone lytic lesions showed that  enhancement curve morphology of the osteoid osteoma s was \nsignificantly different from its mimickers. All osteoid osteomas had early enhancement with a delay between \nnidus and arterial peak below 30 seconds. Eighty percent  of the mimickers demonstrated a  slow and progressive \npattern of enhancement. The perf usion parameters of the other lytic bone lesions were similar to those of the \nosteoid os teomas in 46.1% of the patients, indicating that early enhancement is suggestive but not pathognomonic \nof osteoid osteomas [16]. \nFDG -PET/CT Whole Body  \nFDG-PET/CT is not routinely used in the evaluation of suspected osteoid osteoma.

Next imaging study.  \nLesions seen on radiographs that are not definitely benign often require additional characterization using \nadvanced imaging studies such as MRI or CT.  The next best imaging examination is not always clearly defined \nbecause the choice will be influenced by the radiographic appearance of the lesion, location , number of lesions, \navailability of imaging equipment, plan for biopsy/treatment , as well as underlying patient -specific clinical \nparameters.  \nCT Area of Interest  \nCT continues to play a role in the evaluation of indeterminate bone l esions discovered on radiographs, particularly \nin lesions with mineralized matrix or in suspected cases of osteoid osteoma (see Variant 4). Both MRI and CT \nhave been used to evaluate the degree of cortical involvement in chondroid lesions [ 20]. In comparison with \nradiographs and MRI, CT has been shown to better delineate the presence of cortical destruction and the character \nof matrix mineralizatio n patterns in patients with clear cell chondrosarcoma [21]. In a retrospective review of 40 \npathologically confirmed telangiectatic osteosarcomas, Murph ey et al [ 22] noted that CT was the optimal imaging \nmodality for demonstration of subtle matrix mineralization seen in 85% of cases in the intraosseous or soft -tissue \ncomponents of the lesion. Not all studies conclude that one modality, CT or MRI, is better than the ot her. A multi-\ninstitutional collaborative study assessing the relative accuracy of CT and MRI in the local staging of primary \nmalignant musculoskeletal neoplasms showed no statistically significant difference between CT and MRI in \ndetermining tumor involvem ent of muscle, bone, joints, or neurovascular structures. Further more , the combined \ninterpretation of CT and MRI did not significantly improve accuracy [ 23]. Advanced CT techniques, such as dual -\nenergy CT, have shown promise in differentiating malignant from nonmalignant tumors, although further research \nin this area is needed [ 24]. MRI is generally considered the preferred imaging modal ity for staging of bone \ntumors. Some cases may benefit from both MRI and CT because these modalities provide  comple mentary \ninformation regarding soft -tissue (often better evaluated on MR I) and matrix mineralization (often better \nevaluated on CT).  \nThere is no relevant literature regarding the specific use of CT with IV contrast or CT without and with IV \ncontrast in the evaluation of suspected primary bone tumor with radiographs indeterminate for malignancy.  \nHowever, if contrast is given, CT without and with IV contrast is preferred because it allows differentiati on of \nareas of contrast enhancement from areas of osseous matrix production . \nFDG -PET/CT Whole Body  \nFDG-PET has proven useful for further characterizing indeterminate bone tumors identified on radiogra phs.

Despite its \nwidespread use in this role, there are few controlled studies in the literature over the last 10 years specifically \nevaluating the role of MRI in further characterizing lesions detected on radiographs.  Several studies do exist that \nserve to hig hlight the role of MRI in further characterizing the tissue composition (such as fat, hemorrhage, fluid \nlevels) and anatomic extent of a variety  of bone tumors  [20-22, 34,35]. MRI has also been shown to be useful in \npredicting the grade (benign versus malignant) of known primary bone tumors. A prospective study evaluating \n200 consecutive bone tumors of the hand showed that MRI improve d grading in comparison with radiography \nalone by correctl y upgrading malignant tumors and downgrading benign tumors in 8% and 12% of cases , \nrespectively [7]. Crim et al [9] performed a retrospective review of 53 cases of low-grade  cartilage lesions \n(enchondroma and grade 1 chondrosarcoma) and found that MRI suggested the correct diagnosis of enchondroma \nin 57. 8% of cases (radiographs correctly diagnosed 67.2% of cases) and the correct diagnosis of chondrosarcoma \nin 57.8% of cases (radiographs correctly diagnosed 20.8% of cases). Overall, MRI had an increased rate of both \ntrue-positive and false-positive diagnos is in comparison with radiographs . Similar to radiographic \ncharacterization, the characterization of low -grade  chondroid lesions on MRI is challenging because of  \noverlapping features of benign and malignant lesions.  \nMRI is generally  considered the preferred imaging modality for staging of bone tumors [14]. Hogeboom et al [ 36] \ncompa red the value of MRI to CT in the evaluation of bone tumors  in a prospective study of 25 patients. They \nfound that MRI has better soft -tissue contrast than CT, making it possible to study the relationship of the bone \ntumor to the soft  tissues, bone marrow, and joints more accurately . They found that CT better defines destruction \nof cortical bone. Specifically, MRI was superior to CT in detecting cortical bone destruction in 4.5% of patients \nstudied and better at evaluating marrow involvement in 25%, soft -tissue involvement in 31%, joint involvement in \n36.4%, an d invasion of neurovascular structures in 15.3% of patients.  MRI and CT were judged equivalent in \nthese categories the majority of the time (ranging from  63% to 82%  of the time for the various categories). CT \nwas superior to MRI for some patients in two categories:  detecting cortical bone destruction  (13.6% ) and \nneurovascular involvement (7.7% ). If both modalities are available, the authors suggest that MRI is preferable to \nCT. A prospective study comparing the staging of primary bone sarcoma with CT, MRI, bone scintigraphy, and \nangiography in 56 patients showed that MRI was superior in defining tumor length, demonstrating involvement of \nmuscle compartments, and delineating the relationship between tumor and major neurovascular bundles  [37]. In \nthe same study, MRI was shown to be comparable to CT in demonstrating cortical bone and joint involvement \n[37]. In contrast , results of a multi-institutional collaborative study assessing the relative accuracy of CT and MRI \nin the local staging of primary malignant musculoskeletal neoplasms showed no statistically significant difference \nbetween CT and MRI in determining tumor involvement of muscle, bone, joints, or neurovascular structures  [23]. \nFurther more , the combined interpretation of CT and MRI did not significantly improve accuracy [23].", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f4a1a6c6-b90e-4a3f-8de8-de0e5e73e5b2": {"__data__": {"id_": "f4a1a6c6-b90e-4a3f-8de8-de0e5e73e5b2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "ACR primary bone tumours.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5e4000ba-46bd-469f-9853-8b005955d1e2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "ACR primary bone tumours.pdf"}, "hash": "68bb84b4158593041f8dfaefb0c3bc0d1fdbb58defb6856e0679c3f51dba81e9"}, "2": {"node_id": "28bf7157-5923-4f38-878b-8c81dab5d78c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "ACR primary bone tumours.pdf"}, "hash": "2426c48fa8e2f4d86256e6b8a32cae9952823bc9cc01de87b1f252ab768aa9ed"}}, "hash": "8d02c5853db5ae04357bb43fa5727a49cd577cdf36274c191b917a8ad4a2bba0", "text": "In \nthe same study, MRI was shown to be comparable to CT in demonstrating cortical bone and joint involvement \n[37].

In a study of 37 patients with cartilaginous tumors, Geirnaerdt  et al [ 42] \nevaluated the utility of fast contrast -enhanced MR I in differentiating benign from malignant tumors.  They found \nthat differentiation of malignancy from benignity was possible with this technique, with a sensitivity of 61% and \nspecificity of 95% . The usefulness of MRI with dynamic contrast enhancement in c haracterizing lesions as benign \nor malignant has been evaluated in several additional studies with mixed results [43,44]. Other imaging \ntechniques, such as diffusion -weighted and chemical shif t MRI, have been shown to be useful in differentiating \nbenign from malignant bone tumors  [45-47] . MRI with dynamic contrast enhancement [ 43], as well as diffusion \nand chemical shift MRI [ 47], can help differentiate benign from malignant spinal compression fractures. \nCharacterization of bone tumors as benign or malignant with MR spectroscopy has shown promise in two small \nobservational studies , although further research is needed  [48,49].", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a4dd89b9-4adb-44f9-8e54-690d60b3858d": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4dd89b9-4adb-44f9-8e54-690d60b3858d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "ACR primary bone tumours.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "731995af-b6aa-4727-9966-815e46a299b2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "ACR primary bone tumours.pdf"}, "hash": "ea8a9788f4b59cb45b22076db0649d2a1ae3113ca618ddaad4cc95f613181682"}}, "hash": "99e502f6d61ff8470b4d23b60df5e5c2275634769f99bdc4a45b139180e6c012", "text": "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 10 Primary Bone Tumors  Radiograp hy Skeletal Survey  \nRadiographic survey of the whole body is of limited utility in the evaluation of a suspected primary bone tumor \nwith an indeterminate or aggressive appearance detected on radiographs.

A retrospective review of 99 patients with 108 vertebral lesions showed that SPECT/CT \nwas superior to planar scintigraphy and SPECT alone, but not CT alone, in the characterization of indete rminate \nvertebral lesions found on bone scintigraphy [ 50]. \nUS Area of Interest  \nUS is not routinely used in the evaluation of indeterminate or aggressive bone lesions seen on radiographs.

However, CT, be it without IV contrast, with IV contrast, or without and with  IV contrast, may provide \ncomple mentary information, particularly in respect to assessing mat rix mineralization, cortical destruction, or in \nsuspected cases of osteoid osteoma. If contrast is given, CT without and with IV contrast is preferred because it \nallows differentiati on of areas of contrast enhancement from areas of osseous matrix productio n. However, \nradiographic evaluation is generally recommended as the next best imaging modality.  \nFDG -PET/CT Whole Body  \nRadiographic evaluation is generally recommended as the next best imaging modality to evaluate bone lesions \nincidentally found on MRI and CT. FDG -PET/CT may play a limited role in the evaluation of bone lesions \nincidentally found on MRI and CT.  \nMRI Area of Interest  \nIf the initial MRI is not of sufficient quality (eg , limited coverage, limited sequences, etc)  or was performed using \na nonmusculoskeletal protocol (eg,  an incidentally discovered  bone lesion on a prostate MRI) , then a repeat MRI \nexamination may be warranted.  However, this should typically follow radiographic imaging, which can be used to \nbetter pl an the repeat MRI.  Supplementation of an MRI initially performed without IV contrast with contrast -\nenhanced sequences may provide additional information about  lesion vascularity and relationship to regional \nvascular structures.  MRI evaluation of the area o f interest may provide complementary information facilitating \nfurther assessment of the lesion and can be hel pful in preoperative planning.  \nAlthough  there is no relevant literature regarding the use of MRI in the evaluation of bone lesions incidentally \nfound on CT , MRI may provide comple mentary information, particularly with regard to evaluating soft -tissue \ncomponents. However, radiographic evaluation is generally the next best imaging modality.  \nRadiography Area of Interest  \nAlthough there is no relevant literature specifically regarding recommendations for follow-up of bone lesions \nincidentally found on MRI, radiographic evaluation of the area of interest is generally considered the initial study \nof choice in this situation.

Tumor margin and periosteal reaction provide a reliable index of biological potential of the \ntumor , whereas matrix, if identified, is a key to the underlying histology [ 3-6]. Although the utility of radiographs \nin stratifying bone lesions into aggressive and nonaggressive categories is well established, there is sparse \nliterature documenting concrete values on accuracy. A prospective study evaluating 200 consecutive bone tumors \nof the hand showed that subjective grading of tumors based on radiographic features provided a correct \ncategorization of tumor grade (benign versus malignant) in 82.5% of cases [7]. In a retrospective study applying a \nmodified Lodwick-Mad ewell grading system to categorize 183 bone tumors, Caracciolo et al [8 ] found that a low \nradiographic grade assignment correlates with benignity and that increasing grade correlates with an increasing \nrisk of malignancy. In the case of an incidental lesion on CT, radiographic evaluation of the area of interest may \nbe helpful in allowing for assessment of the lesion based on well -established radiographic criteria. However, \nradiogra phs are unlikely to add any additional information specifically about  matrix mineralization or cortical \ninvolvement that is not readily evident on CT. This is especially true if a high-quality CT with multiplanar \nreformatting in the coronal and sagittal planes was obtained.  \nBone Scan Whole Body  \nRadiographic evaluation is generally recommended as the next best imaging modality to evaluate bone lesions \nincidentally found on MRI and CT.

These procedures are \nequivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be ordered to provide the clinical information to \neffectively manage the patient\u2019s care).  \n\u2022 Variant 3 : MRI without and with IV contrast , MRI without IV contrast , or CT withou t IV contrast may be \nappropriate for evaluating suspected primary bone tumor with benign lesions on radiographs, which is not \nosteoid osteoma.  These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be ordered to \nprovide the clinical information to effectively manage the patient\u2019s care).  \n\u2022 Variant 4:  CT without IV contrast is usually appropriate for a suspected primary bone tumor in patients with \nradiographs or clinical presentations suggestive of osteoid osteoma. The panel did not agree on \nrecommending CT without and with IV contrast in the evaluation of suspected osteoid osteoma because there \nis insufficient medical literature to conclude whether or not these patients would benefit from the procedure. \nCT without and with IV contrast in this  patient population is controversial but may be appropriate.  \n\u2022 Variant 5 : MRI without and with IV contrast is usually appropriate for a suspected primary bone tumor in \npatients with indeterminate or aggressive appearing lesions on radiographs that are sugges tive for malignancy. \nThe panel did not agree on recommending CT without and with IV contrast in the evaluation of indeterminate \nor aggressive bone lesions seen on radiographs because there is insufficient medical literature to conclude \nwhether or not these patients would benefit from CT without and with IV contrast.

The RRLs are based on effective dose, which is a radiation dose quantity that is used to estimate \npopulation total radiation risk associated with an imaging procedure. Patients in the pediatric age group are at \ninherently higher risk from exposure, because of both organ sensitivity and longer life expectancy (relevant to the \nlong latency that appears to accompany radiation exposure). For these reasons, the RRL dose estimate ra nges for \npediatric examinations are lower as compared with those specified for adults (see Table below).

Kransdorf, MD.p \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nTraumatic shoulder pain is shoulder pain believed to be directly attributed to a traumatic event, either acute or \nchronic. This pain may be the result of either fracture (the clavicle, scapula, or proximal humerus) or soft -tissue \ninjury (most commonly of the rotator cuff, acromioclavicular ligaments, or labroligamentous complex). The \nincidence of traumatic shoulder injuries is difficult to determine because some injury types, such as low-grade \nacromioclavicular separations or acute rotator cuff tears, are likely under -reported because patients  do not seek \nimmediate medical treatment. However, as with many traumatic injuries, traumatic shoulder pain tends to \ndisproportionately involve young adults and male patients [ 1,2]. \nThe etiology of traumatic shoulder pain can often be made based on clinical examination, radiographs, and \nmechanism of injury. Traumatic shoulder injuries can generally be separated into in juries requiring acute surgical \nmanagement and injuries in which conservative management can be attempted prior to considering surgical \ntreatment. Unstable or significantly displaced fractures and joint instability are injuries most likely requiring acute \nsurgical treatment. Most soft -tissue injuries (such as labral tears and rotator cuff tears) can undergo a period of \nconservative management prior to considering surgery. However, in addition to the specific imaging findings \nrelated to a traumatic injury, indications and timing of surgical treatment of many traumatic shoulder injuries are \ndependent on patient age, comorbidities, current activity level, and expected activity level.  \nImaging of chronic shoulder pain is beyond the scope of this topic  and is cove red in the  ACR Appropriateness \nCriteria\u00ae on \u201cShoulder Pain\u2013 Atraumatic \u201d [3]. \nDiscussion o f Procedures  by Variant  \nVariant 1:  Traumatic shoulder pain. Any etiology . Initial imaging . \nRadiography Shoulder  \nRadiographs are the preferred initial study performed in the setting of traumatic shoulder pain . They can delineate \nshoulder malalignment and most shoulder fractures [ 4,5]. A standard set of shoulder radiographs for trauma \nshould include at least three  views: anterior -posterior (AP) views in internal and external rotation and an axillary \nor scapula-Y view. Axillary or scapula-Y views are vital in evaluating traumatic shoulder injuries as \nacromioclavicular and glenohumeral dislocations can be misclassified on AP  views [6,7]. Radiographs provide \ngood delineation of bony anatomy to assess for fracture and appropriate shoulder alignment, which are the two \nprimary concerns in management of acute traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs should also be performed upright \nsince malalignment of the shoul der can be under -represented on supine radiographs [ 4]. Additional views, such as \nthe Bernageau view, have been sho wn to be effective in demonstrating the degree of bone loss of the glenoid or \nhumeral head [ 8]. \nCT Shoulder  \nComputed tomography ( CT) is better able than radiogr aphs to characteriz e fracture patterns [ 9-11].", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "16f74b03-1fd5-47bf-89bb-e4656153325c": {"__data__": {"id_": "16f74b03-1fd5-47bf-89bb-e4656153325c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "ACR shoulder pain traumatic.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ffb02fc4-ff74-4d61-ab6a-7f5410aa923c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "ACR shoulder pain traumatic.pdf"}, "hash": "f5832e61ba62a51c520895e2140b91333aeea9a356590f1870113046f8366c52"}, "2": {"node_id": "14490f72-3869-491f-b48d-49e29957bd13", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "ACR shoulder pain traumatic.pdf"}, "hash": "c141f9994a7cacf7e02eba7182b4540e5af75743360f0f4dc85b66a04a0399ba"}}, "hash": "0df7e3a28e0aae384e6dfa3c9d3710409a33f8e8dca81394287de7abcb286bb8", "text": "Radiographs should also be performed upright \nsince malalignment of the shoul der can be under -represented on supine radiographs [ 4].

CT arthrograms have been shown to be comparable to magnetic resonance ( MR) \narthrography in diagnosing Bankart, Hill -Sachs, super ior labral anterior -to-posterior ( SLAP), and full-thickness \nrotator cuff tears, but inferior to MR arthrography for diagnosing partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [ 12], \nincluding bursal -sided tears. CT arthrography has also only demonstrated modest agreement between observers in \ndiagnosing anterior capsular laxity of the shoulder [ 13]. \nMRI Shoulder  \nNoncontrast MR imaging ( MRI) has been shown to be effective in assessing bony morphology and bone loss in \npatients with tr aumatic shoulder injuries [ 14-18 ], and noncontrast MRI is effective in diagnosing most traumatic \nsoft-tissue pathologies including labral, rotator cuff, and glenohumeral ligament injuries [ 17,19,20]. \nMR Arthrography  Shoulder  \nMR arthrography is considered the gold standard for imaging traumatic shoulder pain [4,17,19,21]. MR \narthrography is comparable to noncontrast MRI in assessment of extra -articular soft tissues, and MR arthrography \nhas been shown to be superior to noncontrast MRI i n diagnosing intra -articular pathology like SLAP tears, \nlabroligamentous injuries, and partial rotator cuff tears [17,19]. MR arthrography is comparable to CT in \nevaluating traumatic osseous lesions,  such as bony Bankart  and Hill -Sachs lesions [ 12,18]. However, the need for \nan invasive procedure makes  MR arthrography a suboptimal initial study.  \nUS Shoulder  \nUltrasound ( US) has limited usefulness in patients with traumatic shoulder pain that cannot be localized to the \nrotator cuff or biceps tendon. US is comparable to MRI in evaluating full -thickness rotator cuff tears and rotator \ncuff atrophy [17,22,23]. However,  US is inferior to MRI i n evaluating partial -thickness rot ator cuff tears and \nother intra -articular pathology [ 17,24]. Diagnosis of proximal humerus fractures by US  has been described [ 25], \nbut US is not generally considered a preferred imaging modality for assessing osseous pathology, which are of \nprimary concern in initial assessm ent of traumatic shoulder pain.  \nFDG -PET/CT  Skull Base to Mid-Thigh \nPositron emission tomography ( PET)  (usually using the fluorine -18-2-fluoro -2-deoxy -D-glucose [FDG]  tracer ) \nimaging is rarely used  in assessment of traumatic shoulder pain.  FDG-PET is sensitive for inflammation , and a \ncorrelation has been found between radiotracer activi ty and degree of shoulder pain [26]. However, increased \nradiotracer activity may be due to infectious, traumatic, inflammatory, or neoplastic processes,  making this \nactivity a nonspecific finding. FDG-PET imaging as an isolated modality has relatively poor resolution  for \npathology localization compared with other imaging modalit ies; however , FDG -PET imaging can be performed in \nconjunction  with MRI or CT for better localization of radiotracer activity.

In the acute trauma setting, noncontrast MRI may be preferred to MR arthrography , \nas acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint effusion for assessment of intra -articular \nsoft-tissue structures.

I n the post -traumatic setting, US has been shown to detect abnormalities, including proximal \nhumeral fractures [25]; however, recent studies on US performed for non specific shoulder pain have had \nconflicting results. US  for persistent shoulder pain after trauma has been found to diagnose significant pathology, \nprimarily fractures and rotator cuff tears, in 90% of patients [ 25]. However, 40% of patients presenting with \nnonspecific shoulder pain were found to have no significant pathology on US [38]. Additionally,  US has been \ndemonstrated to be inferior to MRI in assessment of labroligamentous, osseous, and rotator cuff pathology [ 17]. \nUS can b e considered as a screening tool in patients with persistent nonspecific shoulder pain after trauma, \nparticularly in an older patient population in whom rotator cuff tears are more common. However, a low threshold \nshould be maintained for performing additi onal imaging in the setting of a noncontributory shoulder US  \nexam ination . \nCT Shoulder  \nCT has virtually no usefulness in diagnosing common traumatic soft -tissue injuries such as rotator cuff tears, \nlabroligamentous injuries, and muscle tears. Although CT is  the gold standard for diagnosing and characterizing \nfractures, MRI has been shown to be equivalent to CT in diagnosing the nondisplaced fractures that are typically \nmissed on radiographs.  \nCT Arthrography  Shoulder  \nCT is inferior to MRI and US  in diagnosing virtually all extra -articular traumatic soft -tissues injuries.

The most commonly used classification for humeral head fractures \nis the Neer classification  system . A comple te tear of at least one rotator cuff tendon can be seen in up to 40% of \nhumeral head fractures [40]. However, a delay in repair of rotator cuff tears by up to 4  months has not been shown \nto have adverse outcomes on rotator cuff repair [41], and immediate diagnosis and treatment of soft -tissue injury \nin the setting of a proximal humerus fracture may not be required.  \nCT Shoulder  \nNondisplaced fracture planes and complex bony anatomy can result in underappreciation of the extent of proximal \nhumeral fractures on radiographs.

Radiographs show Bankart  or Hill-Sachs lesion. Next imaging  study. \nBankart and Hill -Sachs lesions are common findings associated with transient shoulder dislocation. Bankart \nlesions have a particularly high association with transient shoulder dislocations [50], and a transient shoulder \ndislocation should be presumed if a Bankart lesion is present. A close association exists bet ween Bankart and \nHill-Sachs lesions [ 51], and one should be sought out whenever the other is identified on radiographs. Both \nBankart and Hill -Sachs lesions can present as nonosseous  lesions that are occult on r adiographs and noncontrast \nCT. \nMRI Shoulder  \nSimilar to MR arthrography, noncontrast MRI is comparable to CT in evaluating glenoid and humeral head bone \nloss [12,18]. In general, noncontrast MRI performs well in diagnosing labroligamentous injuries [ 20,52]. \nHowever, noncontrast MRI is considered inferior to MR arthrography for assessing labroligamentous pathology \nfrequently associated with Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions [ 17,19]. Noncontrast MRI is a good alternative to MR \narthrography in the setting of acute injury when significant glenohumeral joint effusion is present to assist in \nvisualization of intra -articular soft -tissue pathology.  \nMR Arthrography  Shoulder  \nMR arthrography is the preferred study for evaluating subacute or chronic Bankart lesions because of  its soft -\ntissue contrast. Multiple studies have shown MR arthrography to be reliable in diagnosing labroligamentous \ninjuries [12,17,52] and superior to noncontrast MRI for this indication [ 17,19]. MR arthrography has been shown \nto be equivalent to CT in the assess ment of glenoid and humeral head bone loss [ 12,18], while being superior to \nCT in assessment of labroligamentous in juries [12]. MR arthrography is also able to delineate humeral head and \nglenoid cartilage, which can be important because some Hill -Sachs lesions affect  cartilage only  [11]. \nCT Shoulder  \nNoncontrast CT has historically been used to assess Hill -Sachs and bony Bankart lesions. However, MRI has \nbeen shown to be equivalent to CT for a ssessing both glenoid and humeral head bone loss [ 12,18,53], and CT is \nlimited in the assessment of cartilaginous Hill -Sachs lesions [11]. In addition, CT cannot assess injury to \nsoft-tissue structures like the labroligamentous complex, which further limits its usefulness in evaluating Bankart \nlesions. CT should be reserved for patients with a contraindication to MRI or patients in whom MRI assessment \nof bone loss is limited.  \nCT Arthrography  Shoulder  \nCT arthrography has sho wn fair agreement between observers and is comparable to MR arthrography in \ndiagnosing Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions [ 12,13].

Glenoid morphology and bone \nloss can play a significant factor in recurrent shoulder dislocations [15, 16,57], which may require bone grafting in \norder to restore stability [ 57].", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f0673664-9a86-40e7-840b-465eefd7f5b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "f0673664-9a86-40e7-840b-465eefd7f5b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "ACR shoulder pain traumatic.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b9f8d54c-acc8-48c2-a74d-cc8dca9bd1f4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "ACR shoulder pain traumatic.pdf"}, "hash": "eed93eb42e53da06d053a1608e88640d41553449befc8a626874227b1cf80da5"}, "3": {"node_id": "9439feaa-1187-4325-a469-cc2efe9075bc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "ACR shoulder pain traumatic.pdf"}, "hash": "55e07846a0bc62781ef9f66ae649de5244fe76b8c542cb70e1520075bfe8a248"}}, "hash": "abddfbbf74602cc17170aef7b8332630e3fd0feefc0fdb0e8a50a4bbd3ff023b", "text": "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 12 Shoulder Pain \u2013Traumatic  MR Arthrography  Shoulder  \nMR arthrography is the preferred exam ination  for the evaluation of subacute shoulder dislocations or recurrent \nshoulder instability. MRI has been shown to have similar performance to CT in the evaluation of Hill-Sachs \nlesions and glenoid bone loss [12,18]. MR arthrography has also been found to be reliable in diagnosi ng anterior \nshoulder instability and labroligamentous injuries [58,59]. MR arthrography has specifically o utperformed \nnoncontrast MRI in assessment of glenohumeral ligament and anterior labral injuries [ 17,19], which ar e \ncommonly seen in shoulder instability. MR arthrogr aphy has also outperformed noncontrast MRI in diagnosis of \nrotator cuff tears [17,19], which is a common associated finding in older patients with shoulder dislocation. \nHowever, high sensitivities reported for MR arthrography in the detection of labral pathology may not be \napplicable to patients with clinically unstable shoulders. A retrospective review of 90 patients with clinically \nunstable shoulders selected for arthroscopy [ 60] found that MR arthrography had a sensitivity of 65% for \ndetection of labral  tears. The authors proposed that this discrepancy with prior studies was the result of different \npatient selection criteria (clinically unstable in their study versus less-specific symptoms such as shoulder pain in \nothers) and the interpretation of MR art hrography by experienced musculoskeletal radiologists [ 60]. For this \ndocument, it is assumed the procedure is performed and interpreted by an expert.  \nMRI Shoulder  \nMRI without contrast may be pre ferred to MR arthrography in the setting of acute shoulder dislocation when a \npost-traumatic joint effusion is present to provide sufficient visualization of soft -tissue structures. In the subacute \nor chronic setting, the glenohumeral joint effusion is usually too small to provide adequate joint distention for \noptimal assessment  of soft -tissue structures. Non contrast MRI has been shown to be inferior to MR arthrography \nin diagnosing labroligamentous and rotator cuff injuries [17,19]. Non contrast MRI performs comparably to CT in \nevaluating glenoid and humeral head bone loss [ 12,18], which may obviate the need for noncontrast CT . \nCT Arthrography  Shoulder  \nCT arthrography is effective in evaluation of shoulder instability. CT arthrogr aphy is comparable to MR \narthrography in the diagnosis of Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions [12] , and moderate agreement has been found \nbetween readers for diagnosing ant erior capsule laxity on CT arthrography. However, CT arthrography has been \nshown to be inferior to MR arthrography in assessing partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [12], which makes CT \narthrography less desirable in older patients with dislocation/instability where rotator cuff tears are common. CT \narthrography may be considered in a patient with shoulder dislocation/instabili ty and contraindication to MRI.  \nCT Shoulder  \nNoncontrast CT has historically been performed to assess bone loss in patients with recurrent dislocation or \nchronic instability. However, recent studies have shown MRI to be equivalent to CT in assessment of glenoid and \nhumeral head bone loss [12,18], which places in question the need for noncontrast CT in the assessment of \nshoulder instability. Noncontrast CT is als o unable to assess rotator cuff and labroligamentous pathology \ncommonly seen in shoulder dislocations/instability.

Chang,  MD.n \nSummary  of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nA variety  of benign and malignant  processes may present  clinically  as a soft tissue  mass.  The behavior  of a mass,  \nwhether  nonaggressive,  indeterminant,  or aggressive,  can often  be discerned  based  on history  and physical  \nexamination.  However,  when  a benign clinical diagnosis  cannot  be confidently provided,  further  characterization  \nof a soft tissue mass  with imaging  is warranted  [1]. Urgent  imag ing requests should be sought  for masses  that are \n>5 cm in diameter,  deep  in location, or have  shown  rapid  growth [2]. Modern imaging  techniques  allow  for a \ndetailed  analysis of the morphology  of a soft tissue mass  as well as further insight  into its biologic  activity , which  \ninforms  the interpreter  on diagnosis  and appropriate  next steps in management  [3,4].  \nThe purpose  of this document  is to identify  the most  appropriate  imaging  study(ies)  to order  for the assessment  of \na soft tissue  mass  based  on the most  frequently encountered  clinical  scenarios in medical  practice.  The rationale for \nthe level  of appropriateness  granted  to each study  option is also described  in accordance with the current  literature  \nand the consensus opinion of the members  of the ACR  Appropriateness Criteria  Expert  Panel  on Musculoskeletal  \nImaging.  This document  does not address follow -up recommendations for patients  with previously diagnosed  \nmasses or the appropriate  approach  or techniques  for the imaging -guided biopsy of known masses.  The former is \ncovered  by a separate ACR  Appropriateness Criteria  document  [4], whereas the latter  requires direct  communication  \nwith the clinician  or orthopedic  oncologist  supervising and coordinating patient  care.  \nOf note,  soft tissue sarcomas are rare, representing  <1%  of all malignancies [5]. Therefore,  we must  emphasize  a \nfundamental  tenet  of orthopedic  oncology:  if a \u201c\u2026practitioner,  or the institution, is not equipped to perform  accurate  \ndiagnostic  studies or definitive  operative  and adjunctive  treatment  \u2026 then it is in the patient\u2019s  best interest  to be \nreferred  to a treatment  center  before  performance of the biopsy\u201d  [6,7] . This tenet  has been  recently  supported by a \nlarge retrospective  analysis  of 25,406 patients  with soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities  that found lower  risk of \npositive  margins  and mortality  in patients  treated  at high-volume  orthopedic  oncology  centers (>20 soft tissue  \nsarcoma patients  annually)  compared  with low-volume  centers [8]. \nInitial Imaging  Definition \nInitial imaging  is defined  as imaging  at the beginning of the care episode for the medical  condition defined  by the \nvariant.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b22c653-d619-478e-9d31-53a3a2c4d328": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b22c653-d619-478e-9d31-53a3a2c4d328", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "ACR soft tissue mass.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c581c8ff-bef0-461b-8ba7-015cd7310abc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "ACR soft tissue mass.pdf"}, "hash": "bc7f5a5676b19b6cbc978f417cfed3ebe4ef45666f8b62c882a99c2fcead0c7c"}, "2": {"node_id": "77f621dd-77ad-4ef1-bac7-711eb9cf9e2f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "ACR soft tissue mass.pdf"}, "hash": "51d279f9d2abebba94fa88a462f120529bc2ae85e22d392d564f34103c375608"}}, "hash": "ff710124093cfce196101e171ec19c9daa7a06113f65e75f4c7156b23e5fd358", "text": "Initial Imaging  Definition \nInitial imaging  is defined  as imaging  at the beginning of the care episode for the medical  condition defined  by the \nvariant.

Initial imaging.  \nThe body  regions  covered  in this clinical  scenario  include  the neck,  chest,  abdomen,  pelvis,  humerus/upper  arm, \nshoulder, elbow,  forearm,  wrist,  hand,  hip, femur/thigh, knee,  tibia/lower  leg, ankle,  and foot. \nRadiography Area  of Interest  \nInitial imaging  assessment  of a suspected  musculoskeletal  soft tissue mass  should almost  invariably  begin with \nradiographic  evaluation  and is advocated  by the European Society  for Medical  Oncology\u2013 European Reference  \nNetwork  Clinical Practice  Guidelines  for rare adult  solid  cancers (ESMO -EURACAN)  [9]. Although often  \nconsidered  unrewarding  by clinicians  without  musculoskeletal  expertise,  a study of the radiogra phic evaluation  of \n454 patients  with proven  soft tissue masses demonstrated  positive  results in 62% of cases,  with calcification  \nidentified  in 27% of cases,  bone  involvement  in 22% of cases,  and intrinsic  fat in 11% of cases [10]. Specifically,  \nradiographic  findings  can be diagnostic  or highly  character istic,  such as in the identification  of phleboliths  within  a \nhemangioma,  the osteocartilaginous  masses  of synovial  chondromatosis,  or the peripherally  more  mature  \nossification  of myositis  ossificans,  to name  just a few. In addition, radiographs  can be diagnostic  of an unsuspected  \nskeletal  abnormality  or deformity  that may manifest  as a soft tissue mass.  Even  when  a specific diagnosis  cannot  \nbe provided,  radiographs  may reveal  information  on the type and scope of mineralization, the presence or absence  \nof unsuspected  foreign  matter,  or changes  within  the adjacent  bone.  In general,  radiographic  findings  related  to a \nsoft tissue mass  can provide  helpful  insight  in determining  the next most  appropriate  imaging  modality  for further  \ncharacterization.  Of note,  radiographs  may not demonstrate an associated  abnormality  when  a mass  is small, deep -\nseated,  nonmineralized,  or in an area with complex  anatomy  such as the flank,  paraspinal  region,  groin,  or deep  soft \ntissues of the hands  and feet [11]. \nUS Area  of Interest  \nUltrasound  (US)  has become increasingly  recognized  as an excellent  triage  tool for evaluation  of superficial  soft \ntissue masses [12-15]. This recognition has been  further  supported by a recent  prospective  study of 219 \nhistologically  proven  masses that showed  US had a sensitivity, specificity, positive  predictive  value,  and negative  \npredictive  value  of 93.3%,  97.9%,  45.2%,  and 99.9%,  respectively , for discriminating  benign  from  malignant  \ntumors  in the superficial  soft tissues [16]. The same group  of researchers had similar  results in an earlier  separate  \nretrospective analysis of 247 histologically  proven  masses [17]. However,  although these results highlight  the \nbenefits of US in the initial assessment  of superficial  masses,  the overall  number  of malignancies in both the \nprospective  [16] and retrospective [17] studies was very small  (12 patients  and 11 patients,  respectively).

Weissman, MD.19 \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntrodu ction/Background \nStress fractures occur in 2  varieties: 1) fatigue fractures result ing from repetitive submaximal stress on normal \nbone , resulting in a region of accelerated bone remodeling [ 1], and 2) insufficiency fractures due to normal \nactivity on bones that are deficient in microstructure and/ or mineralization [ 2]. At the microscopic level, repetitive \noverloading leads to increased osteoclastic activity that exceeds the rate of osteoblastic new bone formati on. This \nresults in bone weakening and microtrabecular disruption (stress injury) and eventually may lead to a cortical \nbreak (stress fracture). Stress fractures are encountered frequently and account for up to 20% of all injuries seen in \nsports medicine clinics  [3]. Stress fractures are particularly common in athletes participating in activities that \nrequire running and jumping, as well as in ballet dancers and military recruits [4,5]. On the other hand, we now \nrecognize that certain medical interventions such as radiation therapy and long -term osteoporosis treatment with \nbisphosphonates predispose patients to stress fractures  [6,7]. \nThe use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has greatly improved our abili ty to diagnose radiographically \noccult stress fractures. Both fatigue and insufficiency fractures are now being more frequently recognized as a \nsource of pain in patients, and although fatigue  and insufficiency fractures can be self -limited and go on to he aling \nwith or without diagnosis, there is usually value in  making the diagnosis. With continued activity, some stress \ninjuries and incomplete (unicortical) stress fractures will progress to completion and require more invasive \ntreatment or delay in return to activity. Also, the differential diagnosis of fatigue/insufficiency fractures includes \nentities that would be treated significantly differently than stress fractures (osteoid osteoma or osteomyelitis in the \nyounger patient, metastases in the older patient). The clinical picture is further clouded by the fact that many older \npatients with insufficiency fractures have histories of previous malignancy.  \nOverview of Imaging Modalities  \nRadiography  \nRadiography is the least expensive and most widely available im aging modality. Radiographs in at least 2  planes \nshould be obtained as the initial imaging study in every patient suspected of having a stress fracture.  Early \nradiographic findings are often nonspecific, for example,  subtle periosteal reaction, \u201cgray cortex \u201d sign, or even \nnonexistent as initial radiographs have reported sensitives of only 15 to 35% [8]. Over time, patients develop \nmore specific radiographic findings, for example,  linear sclerosis perpendicular to the trabeculae.  \nBone scan \nThe bone scan  was regarded  for many years as the gold standard for detecting stress -induced injuries and was \nvalued for its sensitivity. Dobrindt et al [ 9] reported the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive \nvalue, and negative predictive value of bone scintigraphy for detection of stress injuries as 92.9%, 73.8%, 83.3%, \n78.0% , and 91.2%, respectively.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ae70adb-9f56-44eb-8c85-a3a5c342954a": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ae70adb-9f56-44eb-8c85-a3a5c342954a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "ACR stress fracture including sacrum.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b2e8bc68-0807-42d9-a81f-7de3f7526c26", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "ACR stress fracture including sacrum.pdf"}, "hash": "3200a35ed46c8139b426253135fac2838048239175408f6b99f2f20af15081d1"}, "2": {"node_id": "6b79749c-7b92-4493-bc32-f6b3639ca5f2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "ACR stress fracture including sacrum.pdf"}, "hash": "8b85833cb2a644b572b93ac306a4b8f47de615bb1cb2fe8d392b685fc9e3bc84"}}, "hash": "41e98afbe25103d4e4c34f74caadea4d41e62e34337cff8f885417a2e62657ca", "text": "Bone scan \nThe bone scan  was regarded  for many years as the gold standard for detecting stress -induced injuries and was \nvalued for its sensitivity.

The \nobjecti on to the studies quoting high accuracy for bone scintigraphy is that in all of them, positive bone \nscintigraphy is taken as the gold standard for detecting stress fractures and therefore sensitivity is 100%. \nHowever, depending on the staging criteria for bone scintigraphy pattern, the abnormalities may in fact be stress \nreactions rather than actual stress fractures [4,5,7]. Nonetheless, it is clear that bone scintigraphy shows stress \nfractures days to weeks earlier than radiographs in many instances and differentiates between osseous and soft -\ntissue injury as well.  \nMagnetic resonance imaging  \nMRI is extremely sensitive and demonstrates stress abnormalities as early as bone scintigraphy and with as much \nsensitivity [11-14] . The recent literature favors MRI as the procedure of choice for making an early diagnosis of \nboth varieties of stress fractures [15-28 ]. In this regard, MRI out performs radiography, bone scintigraphy, and \ncomputed tomography (CT). Fluid-sensitive sequences are the favored initial sequence for MRI screening [ 29]. \nWith a small field of view, short tau inversion recovery and/or T1-weighted imaging will usually demonstrate a \nfracture line surrounded by edema. In the absence of an actual stress fracture, stress reaction or muscle/tendon \ninjuries can be identified using fluid -sensitive sequences. Thus, MRI may be as sensitive as bone scintigraphy  but \nalso considerably more specific [19,23]. Intravenous contrast is not needed for diagnosis and has yet to provide \nany additional information.  MRI examination of an osseous stress injury contains prognostic as well as diagnostic \ninformation [30,31]. \nComputed tomography  \nCT is not typically used as a first - or second -line imaging tool in the workup of stress fractures  but may offer an \nadjunct role when other im aging modalities are equivocal [ 23], particularly in the pelvis or sacrum . Although  \nsuperior to radiography, it is less sensitive than nu clear scintigraphy or MRI [19]. The benefit of CT seems to lie \nin its specificity, ranging from 88%  to 98% in a recent meta-analysis looking at diagnostic accuracy of imaging \nmodalities for lower -extremity stress fractures, and thus may confirm a suspected stress fracture based on MRI  \n[32]. However, CT does involve ionizing radiation, so it is typically used only when MRI is equivocal.  For the \nevaluation of stress fractures, intravenous contrast is not helpful as a part of CT examinations.  \nUltrasound  \nThere is limited evidence on the u tility of ultrasound in diagnosing stress fractures. Ultrasound is a first -line \nimaging modality in assessing muscles, tendons, joints, and nerves in the extremities  [33], so the radiologist \nshould know the typical sono graphic appearance of stress fractures. S onographic findings of s tress fractures \ninclude  subcutaneous edema , periosteal thickening, cortical bone irregularity, local hyperemia  [33-35 ], and \nperiosteal callus.  Overall, ultrasound appears to be more sensitive than specif ic [32], and similar ultrasound \nfindings can be seen in osteomyelitis or neoplasm. Furthermore, ultrasound cannot evalua te the subcortical bone, \nso trabecular stress fractures may be missed. Although touted as cheap and quick to perform , it is limited a s an \noperator -dependent modality.  \nVariant 1: S uspected stress (fatigue) fracture,  excluding vertebrae.

Detection of osseous change is more limited in areas covered by prominent overlapping soft tissue [17]. If the \nosseous reaction involve s cortical bone, then endosteal/periosteal callus may be visible with or without a fracture \nline through the cortex. If the trabecular bone is involved, then stress fractures are often more  subtle, progressing \nfrom patchy areas of increased density into linear areas of sclerosis, oriented perpendicular to the trabeculae.  \nAlthough bone scans were regarded as the gold-standard examination for many years, MRI is extremely sensitive \nand demonstrates stress abnormalities as early as bone scintigraphy  and with as much sensitivity  [11-14] .

Medial \u201ccompression -type \u201d \nfemoral n eck stress fractures are low risk [40] and can be treated with a non\u2013 weight -bearing  regimen  [42]. \nFinally, stress fractures of the femoral head are high  risk in healthy patients and , if not recognized promptly, have \nincreased  rates of delayed union, nonunion, displacement, and avascular necrosis [17]. Given the importance of \nrecognizing these high-risk fractures in the femoral head and neck, MRI is the preferred second -line study after  \ninitial negative  radiographs to prevent delayed diagnosis.  \nVariant 3: Suspected stress (fatigue) fracture, excluding hip  and vertebrae.

On initial diagnosis, MRI can be used to  predict t ime to return to play in athletes. \nFredericson et al  [48] retrospectively correlated return to activity with an MRI grading system based on the \npattern of periosteal and marrow edema on T1-weighted  and fat -suppressed T 2-weighted sequences. Similar \nfindings were confirmed in other studies  [49-51] , including  that the finding of abnormal cortical signal intensity \nor a fracture line was of prognostic value [ 51] and that MRI performed better in predicting return to activity than \nradiographs , bone scintigraphy, or CT [50,52]. \nA recent prospective study in university athletes found that MRI grading s everity, total-body bone mineral density \nevaluated by dual -energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and location of injury (ie , cortical or trabecular bone)  \nwere important variables for predicting time to full return to sport [ 31]. In this study, periosteal edema as \ndescribed by Fredericson et al [ 48] was not associated with return to sport . Using the modified grading scale and a \nmultiple regression model, for every 1- unit increase in MRI grade, the time to full return to sport increased by \napproximately 48 days [31] . Furthermore, trabecular st ress injuries (eg , femur neck and pubic bone ) were \nassociated with a longer time to return to sport than cortical bone stress injuries. In addition, decreased bone \nmineral density leads to increased time to return to sport . Therefore, bone mineral density provides additional \ndiagnostic and prognostic information [31]. The model of MRI  grade, trabecular versus cortical bone sit e, and \ntotal-body bone mineral density a ccounted for 68% of the variation in time to return to sport [ 31]. Although \nfurther studies are needed, optimization of bone mass may reduce risk of sustaining str ess injuries or possibly \nreduce recovery time i n athletes with these injuries.  \nIt should be noted that after a diagnosis of stress fracture is made, no additional imaging is typically performed. \nPatients are typically followed clinically until they are pain  free, at which time they can  increase activity in a \ncontrolled manner  [53]. \nVariant 6 : Suspected stress (in sufficiency) fracture , pelvis or hip. First imaging study.  \nSee variant 1.  Pelvic and hip insufficiency fractures have varied presentations and often insidious onset. Patients \nfrequently present with intractable lower back or pelvic pain, with loss of mobil ity and independence  and \nsymptom exacerbation with weight bearing [54]. Insufficiency fractures occur in patients with abnormal bone , be \nit from osteoporosis, irradiated bone, or resumpt ion of activity postarthropl asty as typical examples. Insufficiency \nfractures also occur at fairly predictable sites, including the sacrum , supra -acetabular ilium, superior and inferior \npubic rami,  and pubic bone . Radiographs should be the initial imaging modality in patients with low back and/or \npelvic pain. Anterior -posterior ( AP) and lateral lumbar spine and AP pelvis radiographs are usually obtained. \nBecause of  overlying bowel gas, fecal material, vascular calcifications, sacral curvature, and/or copious soft \ntissue, the sensitivity of radiographs is low  [55]. Radiographs may be more likely to be negative initially in older \nor osteoporotic patients with insuffi ciency fractures, particularly when they occur in the pelvis or sacrum  where \nthere is more overlapping soft tissue [ 17].

Patients using corticosteroids may also have less sensitive bone \nscintigraphy  results [1]. The characteristic \u201cHonda\u201d or \u201cH\u201d sign on bone scintigraphy  is commonly referred to as \ndiagnostic of sacral insufficiency fracture. A study by Fujii et al [ 56] confirmed this, finding a positive predictive \nvalue of 94% for the Honda  sign; however, absence of the sign did not rule out a fracture, as only 63% of patients \nwith sacral insufficiency fractures demonstrated this sign.  In fact, there may be an overemphasis on the Honda  \nsign, as many fractures are oriented in the sagittal plane, parallel to the sacroiliac joint. In most cases, bone \nscintigraphy  lacks specificity (with synovitis, arthritis, degenerative joint disease, stress reactions, and tumor \nappearing similar), and supplemental imaging with MRI or CT may be necessary for conclusive diagnosis or to \navoid false positives [1]. Because bone scintigraphy is often nonspecific and time- consuming, and supplemental \nimaging is  frequently  required, there is consensus in the literature that cross-sectional imaging should supersede \nbone scintigraphy  as the imaging of choice for suspected insufficiency fracture when the radiograph is negative  \n[17].", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "821d1bda-70b0-4bba-8b7c-f2aaf72fc004": {"__data__": {"id_": "821d1bda-70b0-4bba-8b7c-f2aaf72fc004", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "ACR stress fracture including sacrum.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ec2f9bf5-5446-433f-936e-3c128fcf84a4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "ACR stress fracture including sacrum.pdf"}, "hash": "988b42e633e2ff27ec0eccdb6d9dc76fb37d23d4cfce6ac6ad799e280bb9ee11"}, "3": {"node_id": "961e7b6f-e476-4c6c-b6a8-0eeeda625660", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "ACR stress fracture including sacrum.pdf"}, "hash": "e4c94e929f4d3a7a8c72cc3308fb9bb386a71d2b32882f5d30533327f7e86a3e"}}, "hash": "80a44e7676abb259b6227ad51e6abe8ca9e4e3b82c1e36123b6fc1385aec7989", "text": "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 11 Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture  It is recommended that cross-sectional imaging fo r hip fractures also include the sacrum, since stress fractures of \nthe sacrum can be the source of radiated hip/groin pain  [15,57,58]. The choice of cross- sectional imaging \nmodality in the evaluation of stress fractures of the sacrum has not always been clear -cut. CT is particularly well-\nsuited for the evaluation of the sacrum and pelvis. If the patient was symptomatic for several weeks before \nimaging was performed,  the CT images  may show periosteal reaction, sclerosis, or the fracture lines themselves  \n[18,20,21]. Although the critical time for stress fracture to show up on MRI postinjury has not been established, it \nseems that the edema pattern would be present within hours  [20,25,27,28]. Studies have demonstrated that the \nMRI pattern can be nonspecific and even confusing when only edema and not the fracture line is shown [1,59]. \nThis problem seems particularly severe in differentiating sacral or pelvic insufficiency fractures from metastases  \n[2,60,61]. These fractures are being recognized with greater frequency as their occurrence h as become more \nwidely known [15,60,62,63]. \nCompounding the problem is the fact that many patients suffering from these insufficiency fractures have a \nhistory of previous malignancy, including treatment with radiation (which increases the risk of insufficiency  \nfracture)  [64]. Over -reliance on nonspecific low-signal T1 and high-signal T2 MRI patterns can lead to \nmisdiagnosis of stress fractures as more aggressive lesio ns. The edema associated with stress fractures is typically \nmuch more pronounced and linear on T2-weighted sequences than on T1-weighted sequences; in patients with \nneoplasm, the lesion is typically more obvious on the T1-weighted sequence [65]. The use of in -phase and out -of-\nphase MRI sequences appears to be more reliable in differentiating benign stress fractures from pathologic \nfractures [66]. Normal marrow has both fat and water in the same voxel, which results in suppression of signal \nintensity on opposed-phase images. In a pathologic fracture, a tumor r eplaces the fat -containing marrow, which \nshould show lack of suppression on the opposed-phase image [66]. However, as described previously, many \ninsufficiency fractures have characteristic locations, for example,  the sacrum, supra-acetabular ilium, superior and \ninferior pubic rami, and pubic bones, and knowledge of the typical locations may add some diagnostic value.  \nVariant  8: Suspected stress (insufficiency) fracture,  lower extremity , excluding pelvis and hip.

Radiographs , if obtained , may be normal or demonstrate \nunilateral or bilateral linear areas of sclerosis. MR I does not use ionizing radiation and has excellent sensitivity, \nand it should be considered the imaging study of choice for definitive diagnosis. MRI typically demonstrates \nlinear T1 and T2 hypointense signal , representing fracture lines,  and T1 hypointense and T2 hyperintense signal \nin the surrounding bone marrow , representing associated edema. Bone scintigraphy  and CT are both associated \nwith radiation exposure to the fetus in a pregnant patient. There is currently insufficient evidence that gadolinium -\nbased contrast agents are without risk to the fetus, so they are recommended in pregnancy  only when information \ncannot be acquired from a noncontrast MRI  [76]. \nFor reference, the approximate mean fetal absorbed d ose from a pelvis radiograph is 1.1 mGy, from a pelvis CT is \n25 mGy, and from bone scintigraphy  is 4.6 mGy (early in pregnancy) and 1.8 mGy (at 9 months estimated \ngestational age) [77]. The specific risk to radiating the fetus appears to be childhood malignancy, with theoretical \nprojections suggesting that for  each 10-mGy exposure there is a maximum risk of 1 additional cancer death per \n1700 exposures [78]. There are no diagnostic radiographic, CT, or nuclear medicine procedures to be considered a \nrisk factor for genetic damage, malformation, or neurodevelopmental effects based on current knowledge  [79]. \nFurthermore, MRI may als o demonstrate other reasons for occult pelvic pain, such as soft -tissue abnormalities or \nthe subchondral hip or supra -acetabular stress fractures described in some osteoporotic patients [63].

Because there is a wide range of radiation exposures associated with \ndifferent diagnostic procedures, a relative radiation level (RRL) indication has been included for each imaging \nexamination. The RRLs are based on effective dose, which is a radiation dose quantity that is used to estimate \npopulation total radiation risk associated with an imaging procedure. Patients in the pediatric age group are at \ninherently higher risk from exposure, both because of organ sensitivity and longer life expectancy (relevant to the \nlong latency that appears to accompany radiation exposure). For these reasons, the RRL dose estimate ranges f or \npediatric examinations are lower as compared to those specified for adults (see Table below).

Diabetes-related  foot \ncomplications , such as soft-tissue infection, osteomyelitis , and neuropathic  osteoarthropathy,  account  for up to \n20% of all diabetic -related  North  American  hospital  admissions,  with up to $1.5 billion  spent  annually in the \nUnited  States  on diabetic  foot ulcer  care [2]. \nNeuropathic  changes in the foot are present  in about  1% of diabetics [3]. Neuropathic  osteoarthropathy  is a \nprogressive  process affecting  the bones,  joints , and soft tissue of the foot and ankle.  Delay  in the diagnosis  may \nlead to derangement  of the bony architecture of the foot, deformity,  recurrent  foot ulcerations,  cellulitis,  \nosteomyelitis , and amputation [4]. \nImaging findings  should not be interpreted  in isolation. Clinical  features that suggest  osteomyelitis  include  an \nulcer  area >2 cm\u00b2, an elevated  erythrocyte  sedimentation  rate level  of >70 mm/hour,  positive probe -to-bone  test, a \nnonhealing  ulcer  for 6 months,  erythema,  fever,  and elevated  white blood cell (WBC) count  [2,5,6]. A negative  \nprobe -to-bone  test may exclude  the diagnosis  of osteomyelitis  with a high negative  predictive  value  [7]. The \nInfectious  Diseases Society  of American  recommends performing  the probe -to-bone  test on any diabetic  foot \ninfection  with an open wound [8]. Deep  wound cultures correlate well with osseous cultures and provide  a \nsensitive method in assessing  and targeting  likely  pathogens  that cause osseous infections  [9]. \nFor the diabetic  foot with a clinical  examination  suggesting crepitus where soft-tissue gas associated  with wet \ngangrene  is suspected,  please see the ACR  Appropria teness  Criteria\u00ae topic  on Suspected  Osteomyelitis,  Septic  \nArthritis, or Soft Tissue Infection  (Excluding  Spine  and Diabetic Foot)  for appropriate  guidance  [10]. \nDiscussion  of Procedures  by Variant  \nVariant  1: Suspected  osteomyelitis of the foot in patients  with  diabetes  mellitus.

CT with or without  IV contrast  is more  sensitive than radiographs  to osseous  changes \nallowing  earlier  detection  of neuropathic  arthropathy  changes of debris,  fragmentation,  disruption,  and dislocation  \n[3,17]. When  metal  is present  in or near the area of interest,  there is significant  loss of image  resolution  that is due  \nto a beam -hardening artifact  [13]. Dual -energy CT may be useful for metal artifact reduction if available. With  \nhigh-resolution multiplanar  imaging,  CT is able to delineate the anatomic  extent  of soft-tissue  infections.  Contrast  \nis preferred  for the evaluation  of soft-tissue  infection  and delineation  of fluid  collections  [16]. \nMRI Foot  \nMRI with or without  enhancement  demonstrates  excellent  soft-tissue contrast  and sensitivity  to marrow  \nabnormalities  [18,19] with high-resolution detail  in multiple  anatomic planes.  The likelihood of osteomyelitis  \nwithout  an associated  wound  or ulceration  is extremely  low. MRI with or without  enhancement  is a good \nmodality  to identify  other  potential sources of pain in this variant , such as soft-tissue infections,  tumors  and \nabscesses,  early  neuropathic  arthropathy,  or subtle  fractures.  Normal  marrow  signal  reliably  excludes  \nosteomyelitis  [20]. Positive  cases of osteomyelitis  demonst rate decreased  T1-weighted  bone  marrow  signal  and \nincreased  signal  on fluid -sensitive  sequences [21,22]. Some  authors  suggest  increased  T2-weighted  bone  marrow  \nsigna l may represent  early  osteomyelitis  or be a predictor  of later development  of osteomyelitis, even  in the \nsetting  of a normal  T1-weighted  signal  [2]. MRI with or without  enhancement  is often  the modality  of choice in \nthis variant  because of its  high sensitivity  for osteomyelitis  [23-25 ]. MRI with or without  IV contrast  can detect  \nthe earliest  findings  of neuropathic  arthropathy,  such as marrow  edema  and trabecular  microfractures [17,26]. A \nnegative  MRI indicates that acute neuropathic  arthropathy  is unlike ly [27]. MRI may be limited  by artifact  \nsecondary  to orthopedic  hardware.  \nPerhaps as important  as detecting  osteomyelitis, the structural  definition  and high spatial  resolution  multiplanar  \nimages are important  for evaluating  the extent  of osseous  involvement  and the location  and size of drainable  fluid  \ncollections  for surgical  planning  [28]. The use of gadolinium  contrast  is useful  to determine  fluid  \ncollection/abscesses,  sinus  tracts,  and devitalized  regions.  The \u201cghost  sign\u201d  on postcontrast  images  may reveal  \nosteomyelitis  superimposed on neuropathic  arthropathy. The ghost sign is noted when bones appear to be \n\u2018\u2018dissolved\u2019\u2019 on T1-weighted images but become more regular morphologically on T2-weighted or contrast -\nenhanced imaging [29].

Suspected osteomyelitis of the foot in patients with diabetes  \nmellitus  with or without neuropathic arthropathy. Additional imaging following radiographs. \nImaging plays  a central  role in characterizing  soft-tissue and osseous infections  in the diabetic foot by identifying  \nthe location, evaluating  the extent  of involvement,  and detecting  complications , such as soft-tissue abscesses or \nsinus  tracts.  The infected  ulcer  may progress  to soft-tissue abscess,  sinus  tract,  infected  tendon sheath,  \nosteomyelitis , or septic arthritis  [29]. If an ulcer  with a positive  probe -to-bone  test is present , the risk of \nosteomyelitis  is 12% to 66% [52-54 ]. The role of any imaging  modality  in these patients  is to confirm  the \npresence of soft-tissue or osseous infection  and determine the anatomic extent  for treatment  planning.  \nUS Foot  \nUS demonstrates limited  benefit  in the detection  of adult  osteomyelitis  because of its inability  to penetrate the \ncortex  of the bone.  The role of US in the diabetic  foot includes  detecting  subperiosteal  and soft-tissue abscesses,  \ntenosynovitis,  joint effusions,  and radiolucent  foreign  bodies.  US is insensitive  to the marrow  edema  and \ntrabecular  microfractures present  in neuropathic  foot. \nCT Foot  \nCT is able to image  large anatomic regions  rapidly with multiplanar  capability.  CT with or without IV contrast  \ndemonstrates  the features of acute osteomyelitis , such as periosteal  reaction,  endosteal  scalloping , and lytic bone  \ndestruction,  more  clearly  and in more  detail  than on radiographs,  but is less sensitive than MRI and nuclear  \nmedicine studies for detecting  early  intramedullary  changes of acute osteomyelitis  [15]. Features of chronic  \nosteomyelitis  (sequestra,  involucrum,  cloaca,  sinus  tracts)  are well depicted  on CT with or without IV contrast . \nCT with or without IV contrast  may be superior  to MRI for the findings  of sequestra,  foreign  bodies,  and soft-\ntissue gas [16].

Dual -energy CT may be useful for metal artifact reduction if available. With  high-\nresolution  multiplanar  imaging,  CT is able to delineate the anatomic extent  of soft-tissue infections.  Contrast  is \npreferred  for the evaluation  of soft-tissue infection  and delineation  of fluid  collections  [16]. \nMRI Foot  \nMRI with or without  enhancement  is the favored  modality  in this variant  and has demonstrated high sensitivity  \n(90%)  and specificity  (83%)  for early  osteomyelitis  in a large meta -analysis [23]. MRI with or without  \nenhancement  demonstrates  excellent  soft-tissue contrast  and sensitivity  to marrow  abnormalities  [18,19] with \nhigh-resolution detail  in multiple  anatomic planes.  Normal  marrow  signal  reliably  excludes  osteomyelitis  [20]. \nPositive  cases of osteomyelitis  demonstrate  decreased  T1-weighted  bone  marrow  signal  and increased  signal  on \nfluid -sensitive sequences  [21,22]. Some  authors  suggest  increased  T2-weighted  bone  marrow  signal  may \nrepresent  early  osteomyelitis  or be a predictor  of later development  of osteomyelitis, even  in the setting  of a \nnormal  T1-weighted  signal  [2]. The high resolution  can delineate the anatomic extent  of osteomyelitis  and assist  \nin surgical  planning [29]. MRI with or without IV contrast  can detect  the earliest  findings  of neuropathic  \narthropathy , such as marrow  edema  and trabecular  microfractures  [17,26]. A negative  MRI indicates that acute  \nneuropathic  arthropathy is unlikely  [27]. MRI may be limited  by artifact  seconda ry to orthopedic  hardware.  \nPerhaps as important  as detecting  osteomyelitis, the structural  definition  and high spatial  resolution  multiplanar  \nimages are important  for evaluating  the extent  of osseous  involvement  and the location  and size of drainable  fluid  \ncollections  for surgical  planning  [28]. The use of gadolinium  contrast  is useful  to determine  fluid  \ncollection/abscesses,  sinus  tracts,  and devitalized  regions.  The \u201cghost  sign\u201d  on postcontrast  images  may reveal  \nosteomyelitis  superimposed on neuropathic  arthropathy  [29].

Beaman, MD.n \nSummary  of Literature  Review  \nIntroduction /Background  \nInfections  of the musculoskeletal  system  are a leading  cause  of pain,  disability,  and health  care encounters.  Because \nof the rise of an aging  population,  diabetes  and obesity,  and orthopedic  surgeries,  the incidence  of musculoskeletal  \ninfections  are also increasing.  The overall  infection  rate following  orthopedic  hardware  placement  is estimated  to \nbe approximately  5%, and the overall  mortality  rate associated  with necrotizing  fasciitis  (NF)  is >10% [1]. \nMusculoskeletal  infections  may have  bone  and soft tissue  involvement  and often  need  imaging  using  a \nmultimodality  approach  [2]. The nonspecific  signs  and symptoms  of musculoskeletal  infections  can make  their \ndiagnosis  particularly  challenging.  Predisposing  conditions  including inflammatory  arthritis,  diabetes,  \nimmunosuppression,  drug and alcohol  abuse,  surgery,  burns,  extremes  of body  habitus,  and poor socioeconomic  \nstatus  can further  add to the difficulty  of diagnosing  musculoskeletal  infections  both clinically  and with imaging  \n[3]. Placement  of orthopedic  hardware  can make  imaging  diagnosis  challenging  because of  metal  artifact,  especially  \non CT and MRI.  \nImaging  plays  a critical  role in the diagnosis  and treatment  of musculoskeletal  infections.  When  imaging  is \nappropriately  used, proper  characterization  of bone  and soft tissue  infections  often  guides  clinical  management.  \nEven  when  infection  is clinically  apparent,  imaging  often  provides  additional  information  including  the extent  of \ninfection  into deeper  tissues,  presence  of abscesses,  joint involvement,  and vascular  complications.  These  \nassessments  are central  to medical,  surgical,  and image -guided  treatments  [4]. \nInitial  Imaging  Definition  \nInitial  imaging  is defined  as imaging  at the beginning  of the care episode  for the medical  condition  defined  by the \nvariant.  More  than one procedure  can be considered  usually  appropriate  in the initial  imaging  evaluation  when:  \n\u2022 There  are procedures  that are equivalent  alternatives  (ie, only one procedure  will be ordered  to \nprovide  the clinical  information  to effectively  manage  the patient\u2019s  care)  \nOR \n\u2022 There  are complementary  procedures  (ie, more  than one procedure  is ordered  as a set or \nsimultaneously  in which  each procedure  provides  unique  clinical  information  to effectively  manage  \nthe patient\u2019s  care).  \nDiscussion  of Procedures  by Variant  \nVariant  1: Suspected  osteomyelitis  or septic  arthritis  or soft tissue  infection  (excluding  spine  and diabetic  \nfoot).

Erosions  and periosteal  reaction  are common  \nfindings  in acute  osteomyelitis,  whereas bone  sclerosis  is commonly  associated  with chronic  osteomyelitis.  In early  \nacute  osteomyelitis  (<14 days),  radiographs  may be normal  or show  only mild soft tissue  swelling  [5]. Soft tissue  \nswelling , joint effusion,  ulcers,  effacement  of fat planes,  gas, and foreign  bodies  may indicate  soft tissue  infections  \nor septic  arthritis  [2]. \nMany  radiographic  findings  are not specific  for infection,  and a differential  diagnosis  may include  tumors,  trauma,  \narthritides , metabolic  conditions,  cardiovascular  etiologies,  and venous  insufficiency  or thrombosis.  However,  \nobtaining  the initial  radiograph  provides  an excellent  overview  of the anatomic  area of interest  and can exclude  \nfractures  and tumors  as the cause  of swelling  or pain.  Radiographs  also help with the interpretati on of future  imaging  \nstudies  such as CT, MRI,  ultrasound  (US), and nuclear  medicine  scans  [6]. \nUS Area  of Interest  \nThere  is insufficient  evidence  to support  the use of US area of interest  for the initial  evaluation  of osteomyelitis,  \nseptic  arthritis,  or soft tissue  infections.  \nVariant  2: Suspected  septic  arthritis  or soft tissue  infection.

On 3-phase  bone  scans,  early  images  may show  increased  activity  with hyperperfusion  and \nhyperemia  on flow and blood  pool phases.

Culture  allows  for identification  of the infectious  organism , which  directly  \naffects  treatment.  Although  imaging  may delay  performing  the aspiration,  preaspiration  imaging  with US, CT, or \nMRI  can be essential  for planning  for a safe aspiration  [8].

Although  CT is not sensitive  at detect ing early  bone  marrow  \nchanges , it can show  early  periosteal  reaction  and bone  erosions,  adjacent  soft tissue  infection , or septic  arthritis . \nMRI  Area  of Interest  \nMRI  allows  for the evaluation  of musculoskeletal  soft tissue  infections  because  of its high sensitivity  to fluid  and \ninflammation  in bones,  joints,  muscle s, tendon s, and other  soft tissues  [2,6,12] . Because of  its excellent  spatial  and \ncontrast  resolution,  MRI  is excellent  at detecting  and evaluating  the extent  of both superficial  and deep  soft tissue  \ninfections  [13]. MRI  can also exclude  soft tissue  infection , if edema  or fluid  signal  representing  inflammation,  joint \neffusion,  or abscess  are not present  [2,6] . Contrast -enhanced  MRI  further  increases  the diagnostic  sensitivity  for \nabscesses,  fistul as, and vascular  complications.  Detection  of inflammation  of joints,  bursa,  tendons,  and muscles  is \nalso improved  with contrast -enhanced  MRI.  \nCompared  to CT, soft tissue  gas is not as well visualized  on MRI.  Although  MRI  often  provides  imaging  for \npreoperative  planning,  MRI  is not commonly  used for image -guided  aspiration  or drainage.  \nUS Area  of Interest  \nUS is useful  for detecting  fluid , including  joint effusions,  abscesses,  and infected  tendon  sheaths.  US-guided  \naspirations  of soft tissue  fluid  collections  and joint effusions  is becoming  increasingly  common  [14]. With  the use \nof color  Doppler,  vascularity  and hyperemia  can be assessed  without  the administration  of IV contrast.

Recent  fracture  or orthopedic  implant  may lower  accuracy  of FDG -PET as FDG -uptake  \ncan be seen in inflammation,  including  aseptic  hardware  loosening  [15,21,22] . \nMRI  Area  of Interest  \nMRI  is highly  accurate  for detection  of acute  osteomyelitis.  Noncontrast  MRI  has high sensitivity  and specificity  \nin the diagnosis  of osteomyelitis.  MRI  is sensitive  at depicting  marrow  signal  changes  of acute  osteomyelitis.  \nAdditionally  MRI  provides  excellent  evaluation  of the adjacent  soft tissues  including  abscess  or fistul as [13,23 -26]. \nThe use of IV contrast  does not improve  diagnosis  of peripheral  osteomyelitis ; however , its use may improve  the \nevaluation  of soft tissue  infections  [27]. \nUS Area  of Interest  \nUS is of limited  benefit  in the diagnosis  of osteomyelitis.  Although findings  such as juxtacortical  fluid  collections  \nand fistulous  tracts  may be seen,  these  findings  are not specific  for osteomyelitis  [28]. \nWBC Scan  and Sulfur  Colloid  Scan  Area  of Interest  \nA sulfur  colloid  scan is often  performed  when  WBC  scan results  are equivocal.  If osteomyelitis  is present,  a sulfur  \ncolloid  scan will show  no radiotracer  activity  in areas  of WBC  scan activity.

Osseous  changes  of osteomyelitis  can be visualized  with CT, although  these  findings  \nare often  nonspecific,  particularly  if there  has been  recent  trauma  or surgery.  CT can be helpful  in identifying  fluid  \ncollections  adjacent  to bone  or surgical  hardware  that can be targeted  for further  investigation  with percutaneous  or \nsurgical  drainage.  CT may also be useful  in the detection  of necrotic  osseous  fragments  or sequestra  that supply  a \nnidus  for chronic  infection  [21].

A retrospective  review  by Hartmann  et al [30] \ndemonstrated  sensitivity  of 100%  and specificity  ranging  from  88% to 93%. This study  included  patients  with \northopedic  implants  and joint replacements.  This small  study  of 33 patients  also suggested  that FDG -PET was most  \nspecific  when  evaluating  infection  in the axial  skeleton.  Wenter  et al [22] retrospectively  reviewed  PET imaging  \nperformed  in 215 patients  for suspected  osteomyelitis  or implant  associated  infection  and reported  sensitivity  of \n88% and specificity  of 76%.  Their  results  also showed  no significant  decrease  in accuracy  in patients  with \northopedic  implants . \nMRI  Area  of Interest  \nMRI  is useful  for the evaluation  of osteomyelitis  or soft tissue  infection  in the setting  of extra -articular  surgical  \nhardware.  MRI  allows  for characterization  of both bone  marrow  signal  and adjacent  soft tissue s. Recent  advances  \nin metal  artifact  reduction  techniques  have  improved  orthopedic  hardware  imaging,  particularly  in the appendicular  \nskeleton  [31]. In the setting  of posttraumatic  osteomyelitis,  MRI  can be used to determine  the degree  of osseous  \nand soft tissue  involvement.

History  of puncture  wound  with  possible  retained  foreign  body.  \nRadiographs  normal.  Next  imaging  study.  \nFor soft tissue infection, the body regions covered are abdomen, neck, ankle, chest, elbow, thigh, foot, forearm, \nhand, hip, arm, knee, pelvis, shoulder, leg, wrist.  \nIn patients  with puncture  wounds,  one of the main  goals  of imaging  is to determine  the presence  or absence  of a \nretained  foreign  body.  Around  the foreign  body  and puncture  wound,  soft tissue  granulomatous  reaction  occurs  and \na superimposed  soft tissue  infection  can develop  including  cellulitis,  abscess,  myositis,  septic  arthritis,  or sinus  tract.  \nForeign  bodies  are either  radiodense  or radiolucent.  Metal,  stone,  and graphite  are radiodense  and are detected  on \nradiographs . However,  plastic,  rubber,  and wood  are not visible  or radiolucent.  Glass  and ceramic  are not always  \nseen on radiographs.  \nCT Area  of Interest   \nCT has been  reported  as 5 to 15 times  more  sensitive  than radiography  in detecting  foreign  bodies  [46]. Precise  \nlocalization  of foreign  bodies  can often  be made  with CT. CT can visualize  soft tissue  gas, which  can be seen in \npuncture  wounds  and in wood  foreign  bodies.  Carneiro  et al [46] suggested  using  thin (1 mm)  slice thickness  \nbecause  foreign  bodies  may be very small  and missed  on CT if thicker  slices  are obtained . Although  radiolucent  on \nradiographs,  glass  and wood  are moderately  hyperdense  on CT. CT can identify  certain  foreign  body  material  \ncomposition  based  on attenuation  and Hounsfield  unit (HU)  values  [47]. The utility  of foreign  body  visualization  \nwith CT is based  on the object \u2019s density,  such as foreign  bodies  with metal  will have  high attenuation  density/HU  \nvalues  and foreign  bodies  that are more  porous  will have  lower  values  because of air content.  \nCT can evaluate  for the complications  of foreign  body  infections  such as cellulitis,  muscle/fascial  edema,  abscesses,  \nsinus  tracts,  and vascular  or tendon  injuries.  Vascular  injuries  or pseudoaneurysms  are best evaluated  with the \nadministration  of IV contrast.  However,  soft tissue  changes  associated  with foreign  bodies,  such as peripheral  \nedema,  hyperemia,  and inflammation,  may require  a more  sensitive  modality  such as MRI  or US. CT can detect  \nbone  changes  related  to foreign  bodies  including  osseous  destruction,  sclerosis,  periosteal  reaction,  or intraosseous  \nabscess  [46,47] .

Although  CT can detect  foreign  bodies  embedded  in bone , CT is not as sensitive  as MRI for \ndetecting  bone  marrow  edema.  \nMRI  Area  of Interest  \nOn MRI,  foreign  bodies  are usually  low signal  on all sequences  and demonstrate  morphology  that is not anatomic  \n(ie, linear  or polygonal  shape ). MRI  is the most  sensitive  modality  for evaluating  the soft tissue  and osseous  changes  \nof infection;  however,  it is not sensitive  or specific  for detecting  foreign  bodies.  Especially  if the foreign  bodies  are \nsmall,  many  may be missed.  Because of  the granulomatous,  inflammatory  response  to foreign  bodies  within  soft \ntissues,  surrounding  fluid  signal,  edema,  peripheral  enhancement  is a dominant  pattern  on MRI,  which  can be used \nto help localize  foreign  bodies.  MRI  with IV contrast  can also assess  complications  of foreign  bodies  in soft tissues  \nand bone,  including  cellulitis,  fasciitis , abscesses,  sinus  tracts,  osteomyelitis,  and vascular  or tendon  injuries.  \nCompared  with US and CT, MRI  has a lower  sensitivity  and inferior  spatial  resolution  for detection  of foreign  \nbodies.  Radiodense  foreign  bodies  are better  visualized  on radiography  [46]. \nMetal lic foreign  bodies  and air produce  susceptibility  artifact , which  can limit  MRI quality.  With  metallic  objects  \nand MRI,  there  is a potential  for severe  soft tissue  heating  and motion  of the foreign  body  because of  the magnetic  \nfield.  The severity  of this risk is dependent  on the ferromagnetic  properties  and location  of the metallic  foreign  \nbody,  how long the foreign  body  has been  in place,  and the strength  of the MRI unit [47]. Therefore,  radiographic  \nscreening  for metallic  foreign  bodies  is recommended  before  MRI. \nUS Area  of Interest   \nIf a foreign  body  is not visualized  on radiographs,  US can be used for further  evaluation  especially  in the acute,  \nemergency  setting  [46,47] . US has a reporte d sensitivity  of 95% for the detection  of foreign  bodies  [48]. Tantray  et \nal [48] reported  out of 120 patients  that went to surgery  for foreign  body  exploration,  US visualized  foreign  bodies  \nin 114 patients.

Furthermore,  US can provide  image  guidance  for removal  of the foreign  \nbodies.  US can show  the complications  of foreign  body  infections  such as cellulitis,  myositis , abscesses,  sinus  tracts,  \nand vascular  or tendon  injuries  [47]. \nAll foreign  bodies  are hyperechoic  on US with some  degree  of posterior  acoustic  shadowing.  A rim of \nhyperechogenicity  may surround  the foreign  body  with increased  inflammation  and vascularity  on color  Doppler.  \nThis can develop  within  24 hours,  and it is thought  to represent  soft tissue  granulomatous  reaction  [47]. Although  \nmost  superficial  foreign  bodies  are visible  on US, deeper  locations  (>4 cm from  the skin) are more  difficult  to detect  \non US [46]. It is also difficult  to visualize  foreign  bodies  if there  is air in the adjacent  soft tissues,  especially  deeper  \nand smaller  foreign  bodies.

Initial  radiographs  show  soft tissue  gas (without  puncture  wound)  \nor are normal  with  high  clinical  suspicion  of necrotizing  fasciitis.  Next  imaging  study.  \nFor soft tissue infection, the body regions covered are abdomen, neck, ankle, chest, elbow, thigh, foot, forearm, \nhand, hip, arm, knee, pelvis, shoulder, leg, wrist.  \nNF is a rare, rapidly  progressive  soft tissue  infection , which  is often  difficult  to treat and requires  surgical  \nintervention  with a high mortality  rate ranging  from  29% to 80% [2,49] . A polymicrobial  infection  composed  of \nboth aerobic  and anaerobic  organisms  is typically  seen.  The infection  causes necrosis  by microvascular  occlusion  \nalong  the fascial  tissues  beginning  at the superficial  fascia  along  the subcutaneous  soft tissues  and then progressing  \ninto the deeper  fascial  layers  between  muscle  planes  and compartments  [49]. \nIn addition  to the clinical  findings  of NF, laboratory  evaluation  can be helpfu l. A scoring  system  named  Laboratory  \nRisk Indicator  for Necrotizing  Fasciitis  (LRINEC ) is often  used, which  takes  into consideration  WBC,  hemoglobin,  \nblood  chemistry  values,  and C-reactive  protein  [50]. Although  NF is primarily  diagnosed  clinically,  imaging  \nfindings  can be critical  to support  the diagnosis,  to aid in surgical  planning,  and to map disease  extent  and \ninvolvement.  However,  obtaining  imaging  studies , such as MRI,  should  not delay  appropriate  surgical  treatment  in \npatients  who are severely  ill and unstable  [49]. \nCT Area  of Interest  \nThe CT findings  in NF correlate  with the pathophysiology  of the infection  causing  soft tissue  inflammation  and \nliquefactive  necrosis.  Skin thickening,  inflammatory  subcutaneous  fat stranding,  and fluid  or gas in the superficial  \nor deep  fascial  planes  are the typical  CT findings  [49,51,52] . In a study  evaluating  20 surgically  proven  cases  of \nNF, Wysoki  et al [53] reported  that CT demonstrated  subcutaneous  fat stranding  and fascial  fluid  or thickening  in \n80%,  soft tissue  gas in 55%,  and abscesses  in 35% of cases.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "685b66db-9c8a-4fdf-a541-b279969a6cf2": {"__data__": {"id_": "685b66db-9c8a-4fdf-a541-b279969a6cf2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "ACR suspected OM septic arthritis soft tissue infection.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "58fd7558-096b-4fc6-8b1e-3e8f0382d941", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "ACR suspected OM septic arthritis soft tissue infection.pdf"}, "hash": "5499abe652348b688f2e3a5f6c5acf055eda57dfe67189d0813895aca8616147"}, "2": {"node_id": "a1cd5498-cdc5-4545-955e-551881f9ade6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "ACR suspected OM septic arthritis soft tissue infection.pdf"}, "hash": "e45f5e5d7929af5329aeadc4530dcfc702320b0f77bb484593bae3846b7e66dc"}}, "hash": "10b8243d9ce4e60a3e309f1da4a4bfb2bbc13d5d32489446e3a7059ad0ca0c80", "text": "In a study  evaluating  20 surgically  proven  cases  of \nNF, Wysoki  et al [53] reported  that CT demonstrated  subcutaneous  fat stranding  and fascial  fluid  or thickening  in \n80%,  soft tissue  gas in 55%,  and abscesses  in 35% of cases.  Tso et al [52] concluded  that although  the overall  \nsensitivity  of CT in diagnosing  NF is 80%,  the specificity  is low because  similar  findings  may be present  in non-\nNF, cellulitis,  pyomyositis,  bursitis,  and other  soft tissue  infections.  \nCompared  with radiography,  US, and MRI,  CT is the most  sensitive  modality  for detection  of soft tissue  gas \n[51,52,54] . Fernando  et al [54] reported  in a meta -analysis  of 23 studies  that the visualization  of soft tissue  gas on \nradiographs  had a sensitivity  of 49% and a specificity  of 94% for the diagnosis  of NF. Soft tissue  gas on CT was \nassociated  with a sensitivity  of 89% and a specificity  of 93% for diagnosing  NF. Gas within  fascial  planes  and fluid \ncollections  is an important  finding  and can be a CT hallmark  of NF; however,  the absence  of soft tissue  gas does \nnot exclude  NF [2,49,51,52] . Early  in the disease  process,  especially  NF infections  with more  aerobic  organisms,  \nand in diabetic  patients,  soft tissue  gas may not be present  or detectable  by CT [52]. \nIn the Fernando  et al meta -analysis  of NF studies,  most  CT examinations  were  performed  without  IV contrast  or \nthe type of CT examination  was not specified  [52,54] . The evaluation  of the use of contrast -enhanced  imaging  in \nthe medical  literature  is limited  [2]. Carbonetti  et al [51] performed  a retrospective  study  investigating  36 selected  \npatients  who had contrast -enhanced  CT imaging  performed  and concern  for NF or other  severe  soft tissue  infection , \nwhich  included  confirmed  patients  with NF (10 surgically  proven  patients),  non-NF (2 patients),  cellulitis  (10 \npatients),  soft tissue  abscess  (7 patients),  myositis  (5 patients),  and gas gangrene  (2 patients).  This study  concluded  \nthat CT findings  of fascial  fluid  and thickening  and lack of enhancement  of the fascia  after CT with IV contrast  \nadministration  were  both highly  associated  with NF. The Carbonetti  et al study  reported  that more  patients  with \nsurgically  proven  NF had absence  of fascial  enhancement  compared  with those  with other  musculoskeletal  \ninfections,  suggesting  that the absence  of fascial  enhancement  was specific  for NF [55]. Contrast -enhanced  CT \nimaging  also improves  the assessment  for abscess,  tissue  necrosis,  and vascular  complications  [6,52] . \nHowever,  noncontrast  CT is highly  accurate  for detection  of NF [2,49,52,54] .", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "30c53c71-d14d-44fb-8469-87f4ed0881eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "30c53c71-d14d-44fb-8469-87f4ed0881eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "ACR suspected OM septic arthritis soft tissue infection.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c26d893f-4dbe-48ac-bdfc-2f8a5cebdbc8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "ACR suspected OM septic arthritis soft tissue infection.pdf"}, "hash": "21053ea687254faa84d730f1bbeddf1e4b376e43de1395f2c6c70cfcd7e7a004"}, "3": {"node_id": "8b25c74c-c489-45b0-a254-08a71337dd67", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "ACR suspected OM septic arthritis soft tissue infection.pdf"}, "hash": "efc1df5381113606497ee24856239b5877b172c0686c2c14d55ea33a820d9682"}}, "hash": "abe842d2cdf6f82c7487fb8165088dc10693a51ecf01f11da91bffd5339a450f", "text": "ACR  Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 12 Suspected  Osteomyelitis , Septic  Arthritis  MRI  Area  of Interest  \nMRI  is the modality  of choice  for detecting  superficial  or deep fascial  fluid  or edema  [2,49,50,52,56,57] . MRI can \nrecognize  small  amounts  of fluid  or edema  in the fascia,  potentially  allowing  for earlier  diagnosis  [54,56] . MRI has \nthe highest  reported  sensitivity  of 93% for the diagnosis  of NF because of  this detection  of fluid  signal  on T2 fat \nsuppressed  or short  tau inversion  recovery  (STIR)  sequences  [49,52] . Furthermore,  the absence  of fluid  signal  along  \nthe fascia  essentially  excludes  the diagnosis  of NF [2,52,56,57] . However,  MRI  findings  of superficial  and deep  \nfascial  fluid  or edema  are not specific  for NF and can be seen in other  soft tissue  infections,  such as severe  cellulitis  \nand non-NF. If the MRI  is negative  or with nonspecific  findings  and there  is high clinical  suspicion  of NF, \nappropriate  surgical  treatment  should  be planned  [49]. Also,  in stable  yet nonimproving  patients,  obtaining  follow -\nup MRI  can be of benefit to assess  for progression  of necrosis  or fascial  fluid  and edema  [49]. \nYoon  et al [50] reported  that thicke ning of the deep  intermuscular  fascia  \u22653 mm on fluid  sensitive  MR sequences  \n(T2-weighted  fat suppression  or STIR),  significant  involvement  of the deep  fascia  with 3 or more  muscular  \ncompartments  involved  in one extremity,  and low signal  intensity  foci or collections  on all MRI  sequences  \nrepresenting  soft tissue  gas were  excellent  predictors  of NF. Fascial  thickening  of >3 mm was seen in 86% of \npatients  versus  30% in the non-NF group,  which  was statistically  significant  (P = .05). Also,  100%  of the NF patients  \nhad extensive  deep  fascial  involvement  whereas  only 39% in the non-NF group  [50]. \nAlthough  CT is more  sensitive  for detect ing soft tissue  gas, it can be seen as low punctate  or curvilinear  signal  on \nall MRI  sequences  (T1-weighted , T2-weighted , STIR)  and can be detected  with high sensitivity  with gradient  echo  \nsequences  because of  blooming  artifact  and susceptibility  artifact.  The presence  of soft tissue  gas is highly  \nassociated  with NF; however,  the absence  of soft tissue  gas on MRI  should  not exclude  the diagnosis  of NF and \nmay be seen in late stages  of NF [50,52,56] . Although  some  degree  of fascial  thickening,  indistinctness  of fascial  \nplanes,  and fluid  accumulation  can be seen on CT, the MRI  high signal  intensity  appearance  of fascial  fluid and \nedema  on T2 fat suppression/STIR  sequences  is far superior  for the detection  of NF [56]. Yoon  et al [50] also \ncompared  2 parameters  for diagnosing  NF: utilization  of the LRINEC  score  only and when  both MRI  findings  and \nthe LRINEC  scores  where  applied  to the diagnostic  scenario.  When  the LRINEC  score  was used alone,  the \nsensitivity,  specificity,  positive  predictive  value , and negative  predictive  value  were 57%,  84%,  77%,  and 67%,  \nrespectively.

They  concluded  that MRI  findings  improved  the overall  sensitivity  of diagnosing  NF. \nThere are varying  reports  regarding  the amount  of fascial  enhancement  present  based  on the stage  of necrosis  \n[49,52] . Similar  to CT, the assessment  of fascial  enhancement  is controversial.  Based  upon  studies  in the MRI \nliterature  from  >20 years  ago, NF fascial  enhancement  patterns  following  IV contrast  administration  are variable  \nwith nonenhancement,  mixed,  and enhancement  patterns  all reported  in the medical  literature  [2,58] . The presence  \nof fascial  enhancement  is attributed  to increased  capillary  permeability  and IV contrast  extravasation.  In contrast,  \nthe absence  of fascial  enhancement  is attributed  to necrosis  and microvascular  occlusion  [2,49,52,58] . In the later \nstages  of NF, focal  or diffuse  nonenhancement  of the fascia  may be seen because of  necrosis,  which  can be helpful  \nto differentiate  from  non-NF [50,52,57] . In general,  contrast -enhanced  MRI  aids in the identification  of abscess  and \nareas  of necrosis,  extent  of infection,  and delineation  of vascular  involvement , which  can be beneficial  in NF \n[2,49,52] . \nHowever , noncontrast  MRI is still an important  examination  with the highest  reported  sensitivities  to detect  soft \ntissue  findings  of fascial  edema/fluid  signal  and can detect  the known  imaging  findings  of NF to include  deep \nfascial/intermuscular  edema,  soft tissue  gas, and fluid  collections  [2,49,50,52,56,57] . \nUS Area  of Interest  \nUS findings  of NF include  soft tissue  gas, subcutaneous  fat edema,  and irregular  thickening  and fluid  along  \nsuperficial  and deep  fascial  planes  [52,57,59,60] . A unique  benefit  to US is the ability  to compare  the contralateral  \nextremity  or other  regions  of normal  tissue.  Also,  US can evaluate  for deep  venous  thrombosis,  provide  image  \nguidance  for fluid  aspiration,  use color  Doppler,  and assess  for foreign  bodies  [52,59] . The US appearance  of soft \ntissue  gas is typically  an echogenic  region  or foci along  the superficial  and/or  deep  fascia  with some  degree  of \nincomplete  posterior  acoustic  shadowing.  The presence  of gas causes  the posterior  acoustic  shadowing,  and the \nchanges  in echotexture  does impede  sound  penetration  which  can limit  visualization  of deeper  structures  [57]. For \nNF, this may cause  US to have  a limited  role for the evaluation  of the deeper  intermuscular  fascia  especially  in \nlarger  body  habitus  patients  [52,57] . The subcutaneous  fat can be thickened  and demonstrate  overall  increased  \nechogenicity  due to fat edema  and inflammatory  change.  Also,  the fat lobules  can form  a cobblestone  appearance  \ndue to the thickening  of subcutaneous  fat septa  [52,57,59,60] .

The overall  sensitivity  of US for the diagnosis  of NF varies  from  \n42% to 88%,  with a specificity  of 70% to 94% [52,59,60] . These  variations  may be due to the amount  of deep  fascial  \nthickening  and fluid  accumulation.  \nThere  is limited  evidence  regarding  the role of US in the diagnosis  of NF [52,57,59,60] .

Corey,  MD.v \nSummary  of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nSpine  infection  is a disease that occurs when  either  microorganisms  or viruses invade  and involve  one or more  \nstructures within  or surrounding  the spine  [1-7]. Although  uncommon,  the incidence of spine  infection  appears to \nbe increasing  because of a combination of predisposing factors,  such as an increasing  number  of susceptible hosts,  \nan increase in the number  of interventional and surgical  spine  procedures , and an increase in diagnostic  testing  [5,8-\n11]. Potential host factors  include  preexisting  extraspinal  infection  (endocarditis,  HIV,  pulmonary infection),  \nintravenous  (IV) drug use, diabetes mellitus, hepatic or renal  failure,  rheumatologic  disease,  or immunosuppression \n[12,13] . Spine  infection  presents a diagnostic  and management  challenge [14]. Diagnostic delay  is not uncommon  \nbecause of an often  indolent  clinical  presentation  with nonspecific  presenting  signs  and symptoms  such as back  \npain,  fever , and, less commonly,  neurologic  compromise  [3,8,10] . The location  of the spine  infection  is also \nimportant  because it may influence  the clinical  presentation  and the subsequent  imaging  evaluation.  One or more  \nspine  structures and/or  compartments may be infected , and this also influe nces the imaging  findings  [1,14] . Spine  \ninfection  is often  extradural , initially  invading  the vertebral  endplate  in adults via a hematogenous  route  and \ncentering  about  the vertebral  endplate  (osteomyelitis)  and intervertebral  disc (discitis). Spine  infection  may also \narise initially  within  a facet  joint. Spine  infection  occurs less frequently in children  and initially  affect s the \nintervertebral  disc [15]. Epidural  and paraspinal  soft tissue involvement  are not uncommon [16,17] . Other  important  \nclinical  manifestations of spine  infection  with imaging  and management  implications  include  epidural  (abscess) , \nsubarachnoid  (meningitis)  space  involvement , or spinal  cord involvement  (myelitis)  [18,19] . Multi level  or \nmultifocal spine  infection  may be observed  in specific patient  groups,  such as IV drug users,  postoperative  spine  \npatients , or in geographic  regions  with endemic infections  such as tuberculosis,  coccidioidomycosis,  or \nneurocysticercosis [5,20-22] .", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "164f1a34-9a27-4367-af36-b314ea4537b2": {"__data__": {"id_": "164f1a34-9a27-4367-af36-b314ea4537b2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "ACR suspected spine infection.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "37d8c903-95f4-4732-8945-88011d50066f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "ACR suspected spine infection.pdf"}, "hash": "0a05eb18ee7e6059ec2de5132730226ce4695f96e1eed3df7394c65a19ba52d2"}, "2": {"node_id": "d7174863-86e5-4868-9668-60c1c5f5d50c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "ACR suspected spine infection.pdf"}, "hash": "1570a7aa0f339d81457ac65daeb8869bf7876eeea06d2ffde03df18a85520689"}, "3": {"node_id": "03070c0c-28b8-4c0d-b14d-862d7fe04e3d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "ACR suspected spine infection.pdf"}, "hash": "10e1d757f9cb96909f96984dc2a049dfc56676ff287f21cf7405659bb86cb59f"}}, "hash": "9bdc9701c602afca2eed72a07c689bff6e247066bf3497ef848a28b1287e16d3", "text": "Multi level  or \nmultifocal spine  infection  may be observed  in specific patient  groups,  such as IV drug users,  postoperative  spine  \npatients , or in geographic  regions  with endemic infections  such as tuberculosis,  coccidioidomycosis,  or \nneurocysticercosis [5,20-22] . The type of infection,  whether  pyogenic,  granulomatous,  parasitic,  or viral, will \nlikewise influence  the clinical  and imaging presentation  [2,4,5,7,23-26] . \nImaging is important  for suggesting  the diagnosis  of spine infection, guiding percutaneous spine  biopsy procedures,  \ndefining  the full extent  of infection  for the purposes  of determining  medical  and/or  surgical  management,  and for \npossible  clinical  follow -up [27-31]. Diag nostic  imaging  can be used to assess suspected  spinal cord compression  as \nwell as to evaluate for potential  spinal  instability, either  of which,  if present  will influence  surgical  intervention  \n[8,32] .

Important  \nlaboratory parameters that may be assessed  include  serum  erythrocyte  sedimentation  rate (ESR),  C-reactive protein  \n(CRP),  white  blood  cell (WBC) count  with differential , and blood cultures [37,48-50] . Other  testing  such as for \nbrucella or mycobacterium  may be helpful  if the patient  is from  the appropriate  endemic  area [2,4,5,7] . Because the \nimaging  appearance of spine  infection  may overlap  with other  noninfectious  pathologic  entities, such as \ndegenerative disc disease,  inflammation, trauma , or neoplasm , spine  biopsy with microbiologic  and histopathologic  \nanalysis of the infected  tissue  is often  required  for diagnostic  confirmation  [35,51-58] . \nSpeci al Imaging  Consid erations \nAlthough  the clinical  presentation  and physical  examination  can help localize the level  of suspected  spine  infection, \nin specific clinical  situations  it may be beneficial  to image  the entire  spine  [21,59] . This may be influenced by \nclinical  presentation  and patient  factors such as a history of IV drug use, specific pathogens  such as tuberculosis , or \ninitial imaging  findings  that demonstrate  multilevel spine  involvement  [21,59-61] . \nLike other  spine  infections,  spinal  epidural  abscess has increased  in incidence and is now seen in 2.5 to 3/10,000  \npatients  [3,60] . Epidural  abscess is often  associated  with diagnos tic delay  that can potentially  lead to significant  \nneurologic  morbidity  and mortality. Patients  with preexisting  risk factors,  such as having  a potential source for \ninfection  (preexisting  infection, IV drug use, recent  spine  procedure)  or a reason  for being immunosuppressed  \n(diabetes,  steroid  use) and patients  with an elevated  ESR, may be at increased  risk for epidural  abscess  \n[18,21,22,62] . \nInitial Imaging  Definition \nInitial imaging  is defined  as imaging  at the beginning of the care episode for the medical  condition defined  by the \nvariant.

CT is often  utilized  to evaluate suspected  spine  infection  when  MRI is equivocal  [3]. It is also of value  in \npresurgical  planning  for patients  with suspected  infection -related  spine  instability , cord compression , as well as \nfollow -up evaluation  of the instrumented  spine  [30]. CT is often  used to facilitate  percutaneous image -guided spine  \nbiopsy [52,57] . \nMRI Spine  Area  of Interest  \nBecause of its excellent  tissue characterization  and anatomic delineation, MRI  without  and with IV contrast  is often  \nutilized  for the evaluation  of patients  with suspected  spine  infection  [3,7,14,16,24,37,51] . The sensitivity, \nspecificity , and accuracy  of MRI in spine  infection  is 96%,  94%, and 92%,  respectively  [14]. MRI also provides  \noptimal depiction  of the intraspinal  contents  including  the epidural  space and the spinal  cord [6,17,18] . The \nexamination  is often  performed  with T1-weighted  and either  T2-weighted  sequences with fat suppression or short  \ntau inversion recovery  sequences followed  by contrast -enhanced  axial  and sagittal  T1-weighted  sequences using fat \nsuppression  technique  [10]. The use of an IV contrast  agent  not only increases lesion conspicuity but also helps  to \ndefine  the extent  of the infectious  process [3]. Furthermore,  the presence of epidural  enhancement  on contrast -\nenhanced  MRI combined with abnormal  lab values is of diagnostic  value  in predicting  which  patients  will have  a \npercutaneous  biopsy that is positive  for spondylodiscitis  [63]. The addition  of a diffusion-weighted  imaging  \nsequence may assist  in differentiating  acute infectious  spondylitis  from  reactive  (Modic  type 1) vertebral  endplate  \nchanges as well as in identifying abscesses [64-67]. MRI  findings  often  lag behind a patient\u2019s  clinical  improvement  \nbased  upon clinical  and laboratory parameters,  but resolution  of subcutaneous  fluid  collections  or decreased  signal  \nabnormality  or abscess size in paraspinal  or epidural  locations  on follow -up MRI  studies may suggest  a treatment  \nresponse [27,68] . MRI when  performed  without  IV contrast  may have utility , because it can show  findings  that are \nsuggestive  of possible  spine  infection , including  marrow  or paraspinal  muscle edema,  abnormal  fluid  collections,  \nareas of abnormal  signal , abnormality  within  the intervertebral  disc, and adjacent  vertebral  endplates and gross  \nstructural  abnormalities  of the involved spine  segment(s)  [3,10,14,16,17,30,63 -66,69] . MRI  performed  with IV \ncontrast  only is not considered  to be useful  because the precontrast  MRI study is required  for comparison  in order  \nto confirm  areas of suspected  abnormality  within  the spine  segment(s)  of interest.

MRI  \nperformed  with IV contrast  only is not considered  to be useful  because the precontrast  MRI  study is required  for \ncomparison  in order  to confirm  areas of suspected  abnormality  within  the spine  segment(s)  of interest.

Beaman, MDp; Mark J. Kransdorf, MDq;  \nJulie Bykowski, MD.r \nSummary of Literature Review \nIntroduction/Background \nCervical Spine Imaging An estimated 3% to 4% of patients presenting to the emer gency department with blunt trauma have sustained an \ninjury to the cervical spine [1,2]. Cervical spine injuries can range from stable minor soft-tissue injuries to \nunstable complex injury patterns resulting in complete disr uption of the cervical spine with possible neurologic or \nvascular injury. The wide spectrum of injury patterns can make the decision process for when to perform imaging \nand what type of imaging to perform challenging. Over utilization of MRI and CT imaging of the cervical spine \ncan result in an extended emergency center visit while aw aiting imaging as well as iatrogenic injuries related to \nprolonged cervical collar placement [3], exposure to in travenous (IV) contrast, and exposure to radiation and \nhigh-power magnetic fields. On the other hand, failure to  identify an unstable cervical spine or cervical vascular \ninjury can result in poor clinical outcomes. \nThe National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study (NEXUS) and the Canadian Cervical Rules (CCR) are \nwell-established clinical criteria for exclusion of clinica lly significant cervical spine injury. In their original \napplication of the NEXUS criteria, Hoffman et al [4] found the NEXUS criteria to have a 99.6% sensitivity for \ndetecting clinically significant cervical injury. The CCR criteria has a similar sensitivity for identifying cervical \nspine injury with the initial study by Stiell et al [5] th at applied the CCR criteria identifying 100% of clinically \nsignificant cervical spine injuries. Si nce their inception, a few studies have directly compared the CCR and \nNEXUS criteria and have found the CCR to slightly outperfo rm NEXUS in selecting patients at risk for cervical \nspine injury [6,7]. However, multiple studies have valid ated the sensitivity of both the NEXUS and CCR criteria \nfor identifying clinically significan t cervical spine injuries [7-12]. The ACR does not take a position on the \nrelative merits of the two sets of criteria; however, th e ACR recognizes both are in widespread clinical practice \nand produce concordant predictions for most patients. Thus, either NEXUS or CCR may be applied to this ACR \nAppropriateness Criteria document. \nThe NEXUS criteria identify 5 clinical factors that either place patients at increased ri sk for cervical spine injury \nor limit clinical assessment of injury (Table 1). Unde r the NEXUS criteria, imaging evaluation of the cervical \nspine is not indicated if none of the 5 clinical factors are present. The strength of the NEXUS criteria is its high sensitivity (99.6%) and negative predic tive value (99.9%) for identifying significant cervical spine injury [4]. \nHowever, the NEXUS criteria have very low specificity (12.9%) [4]. A patient who meets the NEXUS criteria for \ncervical imaging is not necessarily likely to have  sustained a significant cervical spine injury. \n                                                           \naResearch Author, UTHealth-McGovern  Medical School, Houston, Texas.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8344ee67-6f6b-45d5-ab58-0bc5e4bfe12c": {"__data__": {"id_": "8344ee67-6f6b-45d5-ab58-0bc5e4bfe12c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "ACR suspected spine trauma.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "38a8771f-3647-4db5-8548-c0a677c21a10", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "ACR suspected spine trauma.pdf"}, "hash": "22bffb768ea063481466950e5e5930134665baa5eadebc5ad86e77402d04f358"}, "2": {"node_id": "bbe27506-6a86-4616-81e7-cf42ede39435", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "ACR suspected spine trauma.pdf"}, "hash": "426f9c3ead76cdf71cb9720177699ae845189bd516a563a61fbf65adf7915f0b"}}, "hash": "c50917d0830bfaffae136beb5049d9fd8a70e5c9e2344dc70b47870e486d60d5", "text": "A patient who meets the NEXUS criteria for \ncervical imaging is not necessarily likely to have  sustained a significant cervical spine injury. \n                                                           \naResearch Author, UTHealth-McGovern  Medical School, Houston, Texas. bUTHealth-McGovern Medical School, Houston, Texas. cBrigham & Women\u2019s \nHospital & Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts. dPanel Chair (Neurological), Northwell Health , Zucker Hofstra School of Medicine at \nNorthwell, Manhasset, New York. eVanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee. fDuke University School of Medicine, Durham, North \nCarolina; American College of Emergency Physicians. gUK Healthcare Spine and Total Joint Service, Lexington, Kentucky; American Academy of \nOrthopaedic Surgeons. hRadiology Imaging Associates, Denver, Colorado. iWashington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri. jUTHealth-\nMcGovern Medical School, Houston, Texas; neurosurgical consultant. kDavid Geffen School of Medicine at  UCLA, Los Angeles, California. lMedical \nUniversity of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina; No rth American Spine Society. mUniversity of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah. nOregon Health & \nScience University, Portland, Oregon; neurosurgical consultant. oNuclear Radiologist, Weston, Connecticut . pPanel Chair (Musculoskeletal), University of \nKentucky, Lexington, Kentucky. qSpecialty Chair (Musculoskeletal), Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona. rSpecialty Chair (Neurological), UC San Diego Health \nCenter, San Diego, California.

An increasing rate of t horacolumbar spine fractures h as been seen in the United \nStates over the past several decades, despite a decline in other motor vehicle\u2013related injuries [15]. While the exact \nreason for this increase is uncertain, it is likely due to a combination of both increased detection of thoracolumbar \nspine injury and increased rate of seatbelt injury. Similar to cervical in juries, there is a wide spectrum of \nthoracolumbar spine injuries ranging from stable, minor soft -tissue injuries to unstable fracture dislocations that \nare often accompanied by neurologic injuries. In contrast  to the cervical spine, there are no widely used and \nvalidated criteria to help determine if th oracolumbar spine imaging is appropriate. \nClinical examination has a low to very low sensitivit y for identifying thoracolumbar spine injuries [16-18]. \nTherefore, a low threshold should be maintained for screen ing the thoracolumbar spine with imaging in the setting \nof blunt trauma, particularly in older patients, who are at increased risk for spine fractures occurring in the setting \nof low-energy trauma, such as a fall from standing (ie,  fragility fractures), which are due to diminished bone \nmineralization commonly present in older patient populations .

Therefore, scr eening of the entire cervical spine should be considered \nwhenever an injury of the thor acolumbar spine is identified in the setting of blunt trauma. \nCervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine CT reconstructions can be performed from concurrently obtained neck CT \nangiograms, CT imaging of the thorax , or abdomen and pelvis in trauma  patients who are also imaged for \nsuspected soft-tissue or vascular injuries, providing th e same image quality as a dedicated examination without", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f98d3c1c-4a8a-4091-8a64-2d07b8a7f623": {"__data__": {"id_": "f98d3c1c-4a8a-4091-8a64-2d07b8a7f623", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "ACR suspected spine trauma.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1f514ab9-a880-4c3b-84e1-1455a262770f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "ACR suspected spine trauma.pdf"}, "hash": "cb8813d06249415d10e0b0e8aa4e6201789dfeb37ea5797594e612f8df264bce"}, "3": {"node_id": "5d3de9f9-9b66-4de0-886d-355a0241dc33", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "ACR suspected spine trauma.pdf"}, "hash": "1457e78062dec31c5a150055daef3f681ef15b24d155042e87e656e87cc079cc"}}, "hash": "d42a2fae739f78b02e6fb37e75800b085bacc804734ccea35363e29b82dfbcb1", "text": "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 8 Suspected Spine Trauma the need for additional radiation exposure.

Suspected acute blunt cervical \nspine trauma; imaging not indicated by NEXUS or CCR c linical criteria. Patient meets low-risk criteria. \nInitial imaging. \nIt is generally accepted that trauma patients who m eet the low-risk NEXUS or CCR criteria do not require \nimaging evaluation of the cervical spine. However, recen t studies have indicated that the sensitivity of the \nNEXUS criteria for detecting cervical spine injury declin es significantly in elderly patients, with a reported \nsensitivity of only 66% to 89% in patients \u226565 years of age [28,29]. However, a recent study by Tran et al [30] \nsuggests that NEXUS criteria may still e xhibit high sensitivity in patients >65 years of age if distracting injury \nwas defined as signs of trauma to the head/neck and if b aseline mental status was used to define normal mental \nstatus. In light of these findings, performing cervical spine imaging of all blunt trauma patients \u226565 years of age \nmay be considered, even in patients with lower-risk NE XUS criteria. Under the CCR criteria, all blunt trauma \npatients >65 years of age should be considered for cervical spine imaging. \nRadiography Cervical Spine \nRadiographs have largely been supplanted by CT for ass essment of traumatic cervical spine injury. It is well \nestablished that CT is significantly more sensitive than radiographs for identifying cervical spine fractures, with \nradiographs depicting only about a third of fractures visibl e on CT [31]. Radiographs of the cervical spine should \nconsist of, at minimum, 3 views: anteroposterior, late ral, and open-mouth odontoid views. Visualization on the \nlateral radiograph should include the cervicothoracic junc tion; an additional \u201cswimme r\u2019s lateral view\u201d can be \nperformed if the cervicothoracic junction is not visible on the conventional lateral radiograph. The addition of \nflexion-extension views has not been shown to be of clinical usefulness. Flexion-extension views are often \ninadequate for assessing cervical instability because of e ither limited excursion of the cervical spine or poor \nvisualization of the cervicothoracic junction, and they ra rely demonstrate cervical instability not identified on \nconventional cervical radiographs [32-35 ]. A single upright lateral cervical spine radiograph may be useful as a \nproblem-solving tool in case of motion on cervical spine CT . Normal radiographic findings in the area of patient \nmotion may obviate repeat CT [36]. \nCT Myelography Cervical Spine \nThere is no role for CT myelography in  the initial assessment of patients with  low risk for cervical spine injury. \nCT Cervical Spine \nCT is excellent at identifying cervical spine injuries. CT  is considered the gold standard for identification of \ncervical spine fractures, outperforming radiographs in identif ication of cervical spine fractures in high-, moderate- \nand low-risk stratifications [31]. CT is inferior to MRI in identification of many so ft-tissue injuries, such as \nepidural hematoma, cord contusion, and ligament sprain s [37-42]. However, MRI occasionally identifies cervical \nspine instability that was not appreciable on CT. Less th an 1% of unexaminable patients will have evidence of \ncervical spine instability on MRI that is not appreciated on CT [40,41,43-48]. CT may be adequate for excluding \nclinically significant cervical spine in jury in patients without neurologic sy mptoms even in the setting of neck \ntenderness [49].

CT during arterial phase of IV contrast \nadministration (ie, CT angiography [CTA]) provides the added benefit of excellent visualization of arterial \nvasculature for assessment of arterial in jury.

However, CTA has been shown to identify all \nclinically significant cervical arterial injuries [52,53 ], and using catheter angiography as the gold standard \ninherently places CTA at a disadvantage when comparing the two modalities, since catheter angiography arterial \ninjury [50,54] is assumed to be 100% sensitive and 100%  specific. CTA does expose patients to potential adverse \nevents associated with  IV contrast and can make diagnosis of s ubtle cervical spine fractures more challenging \nbecause of the superimposition of high attenuating contrast  on the imaging field if an unenhanced examination \nwas not performed before giving contr ast.

Trauma patients with negative cervical spine CT will have traumatic \nsoft-tissue injuries identified on MRI in 5% to 24% of  cases [39-41,44,45,47,48]. The id entification of these soft-\ntissue injuries often results in extended placement of a cervical collar. However, in  the absence of clinical \nevidence of neurologic or unstable ligament injury, MRI h as a very low probability of identifying a soft-tissue \ninjury requiring surgical treatment that is not appare nt on CT [40,41,43-48,55]. Recent prospective multicenter \ntrials suggest that MRI has a role in evaluating patie nts who have a negative cervical spine CT. The Western \nTrauma Association Multi-Institutional trial reported that CT was effective for ruling out clinically significant \ninjury with a sensitivity of 98.5%. A small but clinically  significant incidence of a mi ssed injury was noted, and \nfurther imaging with MRI is warranted [56]. The pros pective Research Consortium of New England Centers for \nTrauma (ReCONECT) trial studied 767 patients who had a negative cervical spine CT and went on to MRI \nbecause of cervicalgia (43.0%), inability  to evaluate the cervical spine on ph ysical examination (44.1%), or both \n(9.4%). MRI was abnormal in 23.6% of all patients, including ligamentous in jury (16.6%), soft-tissue swelling \n(4.3%), vertebral disc injury (1.4%), and dural hemato mas (1.3%). The patients with abnormal MRI were less \nlikely to have their cervical collar re moved than those with normal MRI (13. 3% versus 88.1%). Eleven patients \nunderwent cervical spine surgery after the MRI results. The clinical significance of these abnormal MRI findings \ncould not be determined from this study group [55].  \nMRA Neck \nThere is no role for MR angiography (MRA) in the initia l assessment of patients with low risk for cervical spine \ninjury. \nArteriography Cervicocerebral \nThere is no role for arteriography in the initial assessmen t of patients with low risk  for cervical spine injury. \nVariant 2: Age greater than or equal to 16 years. Suspected acute cervical spine blunt trauma. Imaging \nindicated by NEXUS or CCR clinical criteria. Initial imaging. \nThe high sensitivity of both the NEXUS criteria and CCR for detecting significant cervical spine injury comes at \na cost of both criteria having a very low specificity fo r significant cervical spine injury. NEXUS has a reported \nsensitivity of 81.2% to 99.6% with a specificity of 12.9%  to 45.8% [4,11]. The original study of CCR by Stiell et \nal [5] reported a sensitivity of 100%, whic h was confirmed in later studies by Du ane et al [11,12]. In head-to-head \ncomparisons, specificity of CCR has been reported from 0.6% to 42.5% [5,7,11,12], overlapping that of the NEXUS criteria. Both of these criteria are widely used fo r clinical screening for cervical spine injury, and it is \ngenerally accepted that patients who do not meet either the NEXUS or CCR criteria do not require imaging evaluation for cervi cal spine injury. \nRadiography Cervical Spine \nRadiographs have largely been supplanted by CT for ass essment of traumatic cervical spine injury. It is well \nestablished that CT is significantly more sensitive than radiographs for identifying cervical spine fractures, with \nradiographs identifying only about a third of fractures visible on CT [31].

CT  is considered the gold standard for identification of \ncervical spine fractures, outperforming radiographs in identif ication of cervical spine fractures in high-, moderate- \nand low-risk stratifications [31]. CT is inferior to MRI in identification of many so ft-tissue injuries, such as \nepidural hematoma, cord contusion, and ligament sprain s [37-42]. However, MRI occasionally identifies cervical \nspine instability that was not appreciable on CT. Less th an 1% of unexaminable patients will have evidence of \ncervical spine instability on MRI that is not appreciated on CT [40,41,43-48]. Several r ecent papers conclude that \nCT may be adequate for excluding clinically significan t cervical spine injury in patients without neurologic \nsymptoms, even in the setting of neck tenderness [49]. Howe ver, recent multicenter trials suggest that CT alone is \nnot sufficient and MRI may be warranted in some patients (see MRI section below). CT with IV contrast does not \naid in detection of cervical spine injury. \nCTA Head and Neck \nCT is the gold standard for identifying cervical spin e fractures. CT during arterial phase of IV contrast \nadministration (CTA) provides the added benefit of excellent  visualization of arterial vasculature for assessment \nof arterial injury. CTA is inferior to catheter angiograp hy in identification of cervical arterial injury [50,51]. \nHowever, CTA has been shown to identify all clinically significant cervical arterial injuries [52,53], and using \ncatheter angiography as the gold standard inherently places CTA at a disadvantage when comparing the two modalities since catheter angiography is assumed to be  100% sensitive and 100% specific. CTA does expose \npatients to potential adverse events asso ciated with IV contrast and can make  diagnosis of subtle cervical spine \nfractures more challenging because of the superimposition of  high attenuating contrast on the imaging field if an \nunenhanced examination was not performed before giving  contrast. Dual-energy CT may also be utilized to \nremove contrast enhancement; however, dual-energy CT is  not widely available. CTA imaging is best reserved \nfor patients with a high index of su spicion for cervical arterial injury. \nMRI Cervical Spine \nMRI is generally considered inferior to CT in identify ing fractures. MRI is superior to CT in identifying soft-\ntissue injuries of the cervical spine [37-42]. MRI will identif y soft-tissue injuries in 5% to 24% of blunt trauma \npatients with negative cervical spine CT [39-41,44,45,47 ,48,55]. The identification of these soft-tissue injuries \noften results in extended placement of a cervical colla r.

Clinical or \nimaging findings suggest arterial injury with or wi thout positive cervical spine CT. Next imaging study. \nArterial injury can be a concern in blunt and penetrating spinal injury. An estimated 1% to 3% of blunt trauma \npatients are diagnosed with cerebrovascular injury  [63,64]. These injuries can include transection, \npseudoaneurysm formation, and simple dissection. Di ssections and pseudoaneurysms  may or may not produce \nstenosis and flow limitation of the affected artery. The presence of dissection in itself is generally taken to \nrepresent a risk of thrombus forma tion and subsequent embolization. \nMany different head and neck injury patterns and c linical symptoms have been associated with blunt \ncerebrovascular injuries (BCVIs) [52,53,63-68]. Up to two-th irds of patients with BCVIs may be asymptomatic at \npresentation [65] and not develop stroke-like symptoms for 48 to 72 hours after initial blunt trauma injury [63,64]. \nScreening for BCVI is ideally performed  to appropriately initiate anticoagul ation therapy prior to the patient \ndeveloping neurologic deficits. While there are no univer sally accepted criteria for guiding imaging evaluation for \nBCVI, the high sensitivity and excellent negative predic tive value of the revised Denver criteria make it a \nreasonable set of criteria when screening blunt trauma patients for BCVI. The Denver screening criteria was first \nproposed in 1994 and subsequently revised in 2004 [6 3] and 2011 [65]. Under the revised Denver criteria, \ncerebrovascular imaging is indicated in any patient who h as one of the signs or symptoms of BCVI or one of the \nrisk factors for BCVI (Table 5).

Using \nconventional angiography as a gold standard, recent studies using multislice CT scanners with 16 or more detector \nrows have found CTA to have a reported sensitivity of 41% to 98% and specificity of 81% to 100% for \nidentifying cervical arterial injury [50,54], although, us ing catheter angiography as the gold standard inherently \nplaces CTA at a disadvantage when comparing the two m odalities because catheter angiography is assumed to be \n100% sensitive and 100% specific. CTA has been shown to detect almost all c linically relevant blunt cervical \narterial injuries, with lower complication rat es than conventional arteriography [50,52,54,70]. \nAt many institutions, CTA has replaced conventional arteri ography for screening of blunt cervical arterial injury \nin high-risk patients because of the short acquisition tim e, low complication rate, and ability to perform CTA at \nthe same time as the neck is bei ng imaged for cervical spine injury. \nMRA Neck \nMRA of the neck is considered an equivalent imaging modality to CTA in assessment of blunt cervical vascular \ninjury. Similar to CTA, MRA has been shown to be inferi or to conventional arteriography in identifying cervical \narterial injury [50,54]. However, like CTA, modern MR A does identify almost all clinically significant cervical \narterial injuries [54]. Fewer data are available on the pe rformance of MRA in identifying  cervical arterial injury \ncompared with CTA. In the only study directly comp aring MRA with CTA, CTA was found to be slightly \npreferable to MRA for identification of blunt cervical arteri al injuries [71]. However, because of its superior soft-\ntissue contrast, MRA may be better than CTA or conventi onal arteriography in identifying intramural hematoma \n[71]. A study by Biffl et al [51] in 2002 also found MRA to perform comparably to CTA in diagnosing BCVI, with MRA having a reported sensitivity of 75% and speci ficity of 67% compared to a sensitivity of 68% and \nspecificity of 67% found in CTA. \nTime-of-flight or phase-contrast sequences can be employed without the use of IV contr ast for creation of virtual \narteriograms. However, the use of IV contrast with 3- D time-of-flight imaging may greatly improve depiction of \nthe vessels for identification of subtle stenosis or pse udoaneurysm formation. In addition, axial T1-weighted fat-\nsuppressed images of the neck can greatly aid in the identification of intramural hematoma [71]. Three-\ndimensional magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo and diffusion-weighted imaging can also show mural \nthrombus related to dissection. \nArteriography Cervicocerebral \nArteriography is the gold standard for identification of cervical arterial injury. Even with improvements in CTA \nand MRA, arteriography still identifies cervical arterial  injuries missed on CTA or MRA [50,52,54]. However, \nmost (79%\u2013100%) of the missed injuries on CTA or MRA are low grade (intimal injury, intramural hematoma, or \nintraluminal thrombus not resulting in complete vascular occlusion) [50,72], which have been found to have little \nto no clinical significance at 10-year follow-up [73]. Furt hermore, arteriography is associated with a 1% to 2% \nrisk of significant complications, such as iatrogenic arteri al dissection and stroke [50,52].

Flexion-extension radiographs have also been show n to identify fewer cervical ligament injuries compared \nwith MRI.

Studies looking at the presence of so ft-tissue injury on cervical spine MRI in patients with \nunreliable physical or neurological examination and negativ e CT have found MRI to be positive in 6% to 49% of \npatients [41,44,45,47,48,78]. Most of these injuries were  minor, requiring either no ch ange in management or \nonly extended cervical collar placement. However, approxi mately 1% of patients with an unreliable clinical \nexamination and negative cervical spine CT will have an unstable cervical spine injury  that requires surgical \nstabilization identified on MRI [38-41,44-48,78-80]. When co mpared with the use of CT with MRI for clearance \nof the cervical spine in mechanically ventilated patients,  use of CT alone has been found to result in decreased \nlength of intensive care unit stay, as well as decreased morb idity related to the rigid cervical collar and ventilation \nwhile demonstrating no missed unstable cervical spin e injuries or difference in patient mortality [80]. \nFurthermore, MRI has been found to have low (64% to 77%) specificity in identifying clinically significant \ninterspinous ligament, intervertebral disc, and paraspinal muscle injury [62]. \nWhile not limited to obtunded patients, recent prospectiv e multicenter trials suggest that MRI has a role in \nevaluating patients who have a negative cervical spine CT. The Western Trauma Association Multi-Institutional \ntrial reported that CT was effective for ruling out clinically  significant injury with a sensitivity of 98.5%. A small \nbut clinically significant incidence of a missed injury was noted [56]. The prospective ReCONECT trial studied \n767 patients who had a negative cervical spine CT and we nt on to MRI because of cervicalgia (43.0%), inability \nto evaluate (44.1%), or both (9.4%). MRI was abnormal in 23.6% of all patients, including ligamentous injury \n(16.6%), soft-tissue swelling (4.3%), vertebral disc injury  (1.4%), and dural hematomas (1.3%). The patients with \nabnormal MRI were less likely to have their cervical colla r removed than those with normal MRI (13.3% versus \n88.1%). Eleven patients underwent cervical spine surgery af ter the MRI results. The clin ical significance of these \nabnormal MRI findings could not be determined from this study group [55]. By inference, it is likely that some \nobtunded patients with negative cervical spine CT will have abnormal MRI, and some of these MRI-detected \ninjuries may require treatment. \nMRA Neck \nThere is no role for MRA in assessment of obtunded patie nts without traumatic injury identified on CT in the \nabsence of clinical findings concer ning for cervical vascular injury. \nArteriography Cervicocerebral \nThere is no role for arteriography in assessment of obtunded patients without traumatic injury identified on CT in \nthe absence of clinical findings con cerning for cervical vascular injury. \nVariant 7: Age greater than or equal to 16 years.

MRI has a \nhigh sensitivity for cervical ligament injury and identifies many ligament injuries that are clinically insignificant \n[42,62]. Flexion-extension radiographs are most appr opriate when MRI has demonstrated abnormal signal in \nspinal ligaments without definite disruption. In this situ ation, where the level and natu re of a suspected lesion are \nknown, flexion-extension radiographs may aid in assessi ng the significance of the MRI findings. However, care \nshould be taken to ensure adequate flexion and extension of cervical ra diographs as muscle spasm can limit \ncervical mobility, masking mechanically unstable cervical injuries. \nCT Myelography Cervical Spine \nThere is no role for CT myelography in assessment of susp ected cervical ligament injury  in the absence of clinical \nsuspicion for vascular injury. \nCTA Head and Neck \nThere is no role for CTA in assessment of patients with  suspected cervical ligament injury in the absence of \nclinical suspicion for vascular injury. \nMRI Cervical Spine \nMRI is the most sensitive imaging study for detection of  ligament injury.

There are not, as yet, established criteria for distinguishing significant from inconsequential apparent \nabnormalities on MRI. In the absence of proven guidelin es, many physicians use through-and-through tears of \nligaments as indicating definite mechanical failure, with lesser evidence of injury, such as simple high signal on \nT2-weighted images, being considered ambiguous [83].

As such, the dia gnosis and prognosis assessment of WA D is based almost exclusively on \nclinical and psychosocial data. Imaging can be of c linical utility in this population by excluding delayed \npresentation of cervical spine instability missed during th e initial cervical spine evaluation and allowing patients \nto begin exercise and mobilization of the cervical spine,  which has been shown to be effective in reducing \nsymptoms of acute and chronic WAD [98,99]. \nRadiography Cervical Spine \nFlexion-extension radiographs are often inadequate to exclude ligament injury in the acute setting because of \nlimited motion and inadequate visualization of the lowe r cervical spine [35,74]. In the outpatient setting, when \npatients are able to tolerate upright imaging and fewe r distracting injuries are present, flexion-extension \nradiographs are much more likely to provide adequate visu alization of the cervical spin e. While flexion-extension \nradiographs have been shown to identify fewer cervical ligament injuries compared with MRI [75], they may be \nconsidered complementary to MRI and may be useful in fu rther assessment of patients with persistent neck pain \nand negative MRI. When obtaining dynamic flexion-exte nsion radiographs, it is impor tant to ensure patients \nachieve at least 30\u00b0 of excursion for both flexion and extension. It is common for patients to exhibit limited \ncervical mobility because of muscle spasm after trauma, and cervical spine instability may only become apparent \nnear the terminal point of flexion or extension. Prog ression of degenerative changes, increased mobility of the \nupper and mid cervical spine, and decreased cervical mob ility have all been associated with WAD [100,101], but \nthere are no radiographic findings that allow confiden t differentiation of WAD from nontraumatic neck pain. \nCT Myelography Cervical Spine \nThere is no role for CT myelography in the assessment of patients with persistent pa in on follow-up visit with \ncervical collar in place. \nCT Cervical Spine \nThere is no role for CT in the assessment of patients with persistent pain on follow-up visit with cervical collar in \nplace. \nCTA Head and Neck \nThere is no role for CTA in the assessment of patients with  persistent pain on follow-up visit with cervical collar \nin place. \nMRI Cervical Spine \nMRI is the gold standard for imaging diagnosis of trau matic soft-tissue injuries of the neck. In the setting of \npersistent neck pain after cervical trauma, MRI may be useful for identifying ligamen t sprains, muscle strains, \ndisc herniation, and bone bruising, which are the most  likely causes of persistent pain. However, MRI has a \ntendency to overestimate the severity of ligament and other soft-tissue injuries with specificity rates reported as \nlow as 64% to 77% for soft-tissue injury and a reported false-positive rate of 25% to 40% [42,62]. Soft-tissue \nedema and signal changes are often slow to resolve, pe rsisting well after the patient has become asymptomatic. \nConversely, subacute to chronic soft -tissue injuries can be difficult to a ppreciate once soft-tissue edema has \nsubsided, and it is often challenging to determine integrity of scarred ligaments. For these reasons, flexion-\nextension radiographs may be complementary to MRI, and performed flexion-extens ion radiographs may better \ndetermine cervical instability in the setting of  subacute or chronic cervical spine injury. \nMuch research has been performed in an  attempt to identify MRI findings that can be used to diagnose or help \nprovide a prognosis for WAD [85,86,88,89,91-97,102,103].

Blunt trauma meeting criteria for thoracic and lumbar \nimaging. Initial imaging. \nImaging is a crucial component in assessment of thoracic and lumbar spine injury. Fr om 1998 to 2011, there was \nan adjusted annual increase of approximately 8% in thor acolumbar spine fractures in patients involved in motor \nvehicle collisions [15]. Thoracolumbar fractures are cha llenging to identify clinically, with only 48% to 75% of \nthoracolumbar injuries identified on clinical examination [16-18]. Unlike cervical injuries, well-defined clinical \ncriteria have not been established to determine when thor acolumbar imaging is appropriate in the setting of blunt \ntraumatic injury. Since clinical examination has poor sen sitivity for identifying thoracolumbar injuries, any high-\nrisk patient (mid line thoracolumbar tenderness, high-energ y mechanism of injury, or >60 years of age), as well as \nunexaminable patients (intoxicated, GCS <15, distracting injury), should undergo imaging of the thoracolumbar \nspine. Screening of the entire spine is advised, as an es timated 20% of spine injuries will have a second associated \nspinal injury at a noncontiguous level [26,27]. \nRadiography  Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nIt is well established that CT outperforms radiographs in  the diagnosis of thoracolumbar spine fractures [104-\n108]. Radiographs have a reported sens itivity of 49% to 62% for identifying thoracic spine fractures and 67% to \n82% sensitivity for identifying lumbar spine fractures [ 104,107,108] compared with the reported sensitivity of \n94% to 100% for identifying thoracolumbar spine fract ures using CT [104,107,108]. However, the clinical \nsignificance of fractures missed on radiographs is uncertain . If screening of the thoracolumbar spine is performed \nusing radiographs, imaging should consis t of anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the thoracic and lumbar \nspine with additional \u201cswimmer\u2019s lateral\u201d view of the upper thoracic spine if this region is obscured by the \noverlying shoulders. \nCT Myelography Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nThere is no role for CT myelography in the in itial assessment of thoraco lumbar spine injury. \nCT Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nCT is the gold standard for identifying fractures of the t horacolumbar spine with a reported sensitivity of 94% to \n100% [104,107-110]. In addition to identifying thoracolumbar spine injuri es, CT is excellent for delineating soft-\ntissue injuries of the chest, abdomen, and pelvic regi on that often accompany spinal fractures. However, CT \nimaging of the thoracolumbar spine is more commonly pe rformed as part of CT evaluation of the entire thorax, \nabdomen, and pelvis in trauma patients with high index of suspicion for soft-tissue injuries or who cannot be \ncleared by clinical examination. It is debated whethe r dedicated reformatted images using collimated field-of-\nviews centered on the thoracolumbar spine with dedicated  \u201chard kernel\u201d image algorithms are more accurate for \nidentifying bony pathology. Recent studi es indicate that identification of thoracolumbar spine fractures on routine \nthoracic, abdomen, and pelvic CT imaging using routine body large fields of view and \u201csoft kernel\u201d image \nalgorithms is comparable to dedicated thoracolumbar spine reformatted images.

Ac ute thoracic or lumbar spine injury detected on \nradiographs or noncontrast CT. Neurologic abnormalities. Next imaging study. \nCT Myelography Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nCT myelography can be performed to assess for traumatic spinal canal narrowing that is due to disc herniation or \nepidural hematoma and to assess for preganglionic nerve root avulsions. Ho wever, as with conventional CT, CT \nmyelography is inferior to MRI in assessing cord contus ion, cord hemorrhage, and postganglionic nerve root \ninjuries [40,41,43,57]. Performance of thoracolumbar CT myelogram can also be technically challenging, \nparticularly in patients with suspected  unstable thoracolumbar spine injury. \nCT Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nCT does play a role in the initial assessment of thoracic and lumbar spine injury. However, CT is significantly \ninferior to MRI in identifying many soft-tissue pathologies,  such as cord contusion, epidural hematoma, and nerve \nroot avulsions that can cause neurologic deficits re quiring surgical intervention [40,41,43,57]. Therefore, CT \nshould not be considered adequate for excluding signifi cant soft-tissue pathology in patients presenting with \nthoracolumbar spine trauma and neurologic deficit. \nMRI Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nMRI should be performed in patients who have possible spinal  cord injury, in whom there is clinical concern for \ncord compression that is due to disc protrusion or hema toma, and in those suspected of ligamentous instability. \nMRI is valuable for characterizing the cause of myelopathy in  patients with spinal cord  injury. The severity of the \ninjury\u2014including extent of intramedullary hemorrhage , length of edema, and evidence of cord transection\u2014\ncontributes to predicting outcome. Compression of the cord  by disc herniation, bone fragments, and hematomas is \nbest displayed on MRI, and MRI may be used to guide su rgical interventions [41,43]. For these reasons, the MRI \nexamination should include T2-weighted images as well as gradient-echo images. In the subacute and chronic \nstages after cord trauma, MRI can help define the extent of  cord injury. This is particularly important in patients \nwho suffer late deterioration, which is sometimes cau sed by treatable etiologies like the development or \nenlargement of intramedullary cavities,  such as a post-traumatic syringomyelia. \nAlthough numerous research studies ha ve reported a potential value of diffusion MRI for characterizing spinal \ncord injury [111], technical problems have prevented wid espread application of this technique to human studies. \nThe current utility of diffusion MRI for assessing cord trauma remains unknown. \nSummary of Recommendations \n\uf0b7 Variant 1: Imaging is not recommended for the initial imaging of patients \u226516 years of age and <65 years of \nage with suspected acute blunt cervi cal spine trauma when imaging is  not indicated by NEXUS or CCR \nclinical criteria and the patient meets low-risk criteria. \n\uf0b7 Variant 2: CT cervical spine without IV contrast is usually  appropriate for the initial imaging of patients \u226516 \nyears of age with suspected acute blunt trauma of the cervical spine when imaging is indicated by NEXUS or \nCCR clinical criteria. \n\uf0b7 Variant 3: MRI cervical spine without IV contrast is usua lly appropriate as the next imaging study for \npatients \u226516 years of age with suspected acute blunt trauma of the cervical spine and confirmed or suspected \ncervical spinal cord or nerve root injury, with or  without traumatic injury identified on cervical CT. \n\uf0b7 Variant 4: CT cervical spine without IV contrast and MRI cervical spine without IV contrast are usually \nappropriate for patients \u226516 years of age with acute cervical spine injury detected on radiographs and \ntreatment planning for mechanically unstable spine.

Patients in the pediatric age group are at \ninherently higher risk from exposure, because of both orga n sensitivity and longer life expectancy (relevant to the \nlong latency that appears to accompany radiation exposure). For these reasons, the RRL dose estimate ranges for", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}",
