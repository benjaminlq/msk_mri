Nonlocalized shoulder pain. Negative radiographs . Next imaging \nstudy. \nAppropriately positioned  radiographs can exclude shoulder dislocation and most displaced fractures as the \netiology for post -traumatic shoulder pain. In the setting of normal shoulder radiographs, the most common causes \nof post -traumatic shoulder pain are soft -tissue injuries such  as rotator cuff and labral tears.  \nMRI Shoulder  \nNoncontrast MRI is a reasonable imaging study in the setting of acute nonlocalized traumatic shoulder pain and \nnoncontributory radiographs. In the acute trauma setting, noncontrast MRI may be preferred to MR arthrography , \nas acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint effusion for assessment of intra -articular \nsoft-tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic \npathology such as capsular and ligament tears [34,35].

A standard set of shoulder radiographs for trauma \nshould include at least three  views: anterior -posterior (AP) views in internal and external rotation and an axillary \nor scapula-Y view. Axillary or scapula-Y views are vital in evaluating traumatic shoulder injuries as \nacromioclavicular and glenohumeral dislocations can be misclassified on AP  views [6,7].

Chronic ankle  pain can be caused by a variety \nof osseous or soft -tissue abnormalities, either alone or in combination. For assessing chronic ankle pain, there are \nmultiple imaging options, including radiography, stress radiography,  computed tomography (CT)  radionuclide \nbone scanning, ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and various injection procedures. Injection \nproce dures include arthrography, CT arthrography, MR arthrography, and diagnostic injection with anesthetic \nagents. Although there are numerous causes for chronic ankle pain, common etiologies include osteoarthritis, \nosteochondral injury, tendon abnormalities, ligament abnormalities and instability, and impingement.  \nOverview of Imaging Modalities  \nRadiography Radiographs can provide information about the osseous and soft -tissue structures about the ankle.

Persistent pain for more than 6  \nyears has been reported in 51% of women between 70 to 75 years of age [4].

Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a \nsignificant improvement in health-related quality of life with effective treatment of foot pain [3] . Estimating the \nprevalence of chron ic foot pain is challenging, because there is no consensus regarding the definition of chronic \npain in the literature. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines chronic pain as any pain persisting \npast the normal healing time, suggesting 3 months in case of chronic pain of benign causes.  \nWomen are more commonly affected , and forefoot conditions are more frequent. Persistent pain for more than 6  \nyears has been reported in 51% of women between 70 to 75 years of age [4]. Because of  the wide range of causes \nof chronic foot pain, assessment of these patients with imaging studies in addition to a dedicated clinical \nexamination is often needed [1] .", "Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  \nusually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, \nosteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite \nversus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess \nwith radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton\u2019s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other \ncauses of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg\u2019s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals \nor soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . \nThough radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in \npatients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The \ncombination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a \nspecificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15]. \nUS Foot  \nUltrasound (US) is usually not indicate d as the first imaging  study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain, but may \nbe performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of pathologic conditions of the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, \nand other conditions such as tarsal tunnel syndrome, Morton\u2019s  neuroma , plantar plate tears,  and intermetatarsal \nbursitis. \nVariant 2: Persistent posttraumatic foot pain.

Overall \nsensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs \nin the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral \nand oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar \ncoalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs \non the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have \nbeen found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable \nmethods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  \nRadiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review \nby Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for \nradiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.  \nRadiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain."], ["With MRI as the reference \nstandard, Gregg et al [49]  showed a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV , and accuracy of 91%, 44%, 93%, 35% , and \n85%, respectively , for US in the detection of metatarsophalangeal plantar plate tears in symptomatic subjects. A \nmeta -analysis showed higher diagnostic accuracy for MRI than US for the detection of plantar plate tears.

A characteristic p attern of abnormal uptake on 3-phase bone scintigraphy \nhas been proven helpful to differentiate plantar fasciitis from calcaneal stress or avulsion fractures [51].

The choice of imaging modality depends on the patient\u2019s \npresentation and the clinical questions being asked. There are scenarios in which no imaging beyond baseline \nradiographs is necessary, but in other situations advanced imaging has added value for diagnostic eva luation and \ntreatment planning.  \nOverview of Imaging Modalities  \nRadiographs  \nImaging evaluation of the painful wrist should begin with radiog raphs [1,2]. This simple study may establish a \nspecific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, \nimpaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -\nanterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or \nmore oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling \n[3]. A v ariety of stress positions and maneuvers can be performed to elicit dynamic instability that is not visible \non standard radiographs [ 4]. Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. \nAdditionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ]."], ["ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 16 Chronic Wrist Pain  Arthrography  Wrist  \nOnce a scaphoid fracture is identified, Radiographic arthrography does not contribute to the evaluation for \ncomplications of the fracture.  \nVariant 12: Chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or nonspecific. Suspect carpal tunnel syndrome.  Next \nstudy. \nUS Wrist \nSeveral meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the \ncarpal  tunnel  inlet) is highly accurate for identifying carpal  tunnel syndrome  diagnosed clinically or with the \ncombination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US \nvaries depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the \nmeasurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary \nexamination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel \nsyndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal \ntunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, \nclinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of \ncarpal tunnel syndrome. US may be appropriate in cases where this initial evaluation is equivocal.  \nMRI Wrist  \nHistorically, carpal tunnel syndrome has been diagnosed based on clinical signs and sympt oms and confirmed by \nthe results of electrodiagnostic studies [67]. MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in cases in which this  \ninitial evaluation is equivocal. The MRI findings that have been reported in wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome \u2014\nincluding nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing\u2014may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value \nin patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68].", "In rare cases of secondary carpal tunnel syndrome, MRI may identify \na mass lesion compressing the median nerve. There is some evidence that the length of T2 hyperintensity in the \nmedian nerve can help prognosticate the success of surgery [69] and that the shape and signal of the nerve predict \nclinical response to a steroid injection in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome [70 ].

Common pain generators in the shoulder  include  the rotator  cuff tendons,  biceps \ntendon,  labrum,  glenohumeral  articular  cartilage,  acromioclavicular  joint, bones,  suprascapular  and axillary  nerves,  \nand the joint capsule/synovium.  Imaging  can help to guide  appropriate  therapy , which  can range  from  conservative  \nmeasures such as physical  therapy  and cortico steroid  injections  to more  invasive  procedures  such as arthroscopy or \nsurgery . This document  focuses on the imaging approach  to patients  with suspected  chronic  mechanical  shoulder  \npain.", "Thickening of the coracohumeral  ligament, increased  rotator  interval  soft tissue,  and decrease d external  \nrotation  on dynamic  US are all highly sensitive and specific findings  for adhesive capsulitis  [115]. Thickening of \nthe axillary  recess capsule  can be accurately  measured  with US and is associated  with adhesive  capsulitis [116] . \nHyperemia with Doppler  imaging,  particularly  with microflow  imaging,  can also be seen in the subcoracoid fat \ntriangle  in patients  with adhesive capsulitis  [117] . One study found  that findings  of adhesive capsulitis  on US were  \ncorrelated  with clinical  assessment , whereas findings  on MRI were not [108] . \nVariant  6: Chronic  shoulder  pain.

Teixeira  et al [118]  reported  a \nsensitivity  of 74% to 79% and a specificity  of 93% to 95% for tendinopathy  as well as 100%  sensitivity  and 93% \nspecificity  for complete biceps ruptures . However,  Rol et al [119]  reported  a correlation  of only 45% to 65% with \nsubsequent  arthroscopy  in a study  consisting  mostly  of patients  who underwent  CT arthrography.  CT arthrography  \ndiagnosis  of biceps tendinopathy is primarily  based  off the change in tendon  caliber.", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 10 Chronic Shoulder Pain  US Shoulder  \nUS is reported  to be 98% sensitive and 94% specific for calcium  hydroxyapatite  in the rotator  cuff tendons  [71], \nalthough  identification  may be challenging if the area of calcium  deposition  is small . At times  US may have  \ndifficulty  distinguishing calcific  deposits  from  heterotopic  ossification  because both can result  in dense shadowing  \nat US. US can be used if there  is concern  for concomitant  rotator  cuff tendon tear and may be a better  modality  than \nMRI in this situation  given the difficulty  of distinguishing  calcium  from  normal  tendon at MRI.  \nVariant  4: Chronic  shoulder  pain.

Among  \nperiprosthetic  fractures,  supracondylar  distal  femur  fractures are most  common,  whereas patellar  fractures are rare \n[135,136] . Supracondylar  fractures occur  in 0.3%  to 2.5%  of TKA,  usually  within  2 to 4 years after surgery,  and \noften  occur  in the setting  of low-energy  trauma  [136] . Tibial fractures  are associated  with loose  components  and \nmalalignment.  Patellar  fractures are associated  with rheumatoid  arthritis, steroid  use, osteonecrosis,  and \nmalalignment.  Most  patients  with periprosthetic  fractures are elderly,  having poor bone  stock.  Treatment  depends", "Severe instability  can result  in \ndislocation. In a 2014 review of 781 cases of prosthesis failure,  Sharkey  et al [12] found that instability  represented  \nthe third  most  common  cause of prosthesis failure  overall,  accounting  for 7.5%  of all cases.  The concepts of \ninstability, malalignment, and loosening in TKA are closely  interrelated  [117] . When  malalignme nt of the joint is \ncreated  at the time of surgery,  minor  degrees of instability  can become a significant  problem.  By the same  token,  \ninstability, ongoing over time, can give rise to malalignment, which,  in turn, can lead to loosening.  Although \nligamentous  balance/imbalance plays  a role in joint instability, it is not the only factor  accounting for stability  [118] . \n3-Phase  Bone  Scan  Knee  \nThere is insufficient  evidence to support  routine  use of Tc-99m  3-phase bone  scans for the assessment  of instability.  \nBone  scintigraphy may be helpful  in diagnosing loosening,  especially  when  obtained many  years after surgery  [62]. \nThis delay  in maximum utility  is because of  the observation that positive  bone  scans are noted in 20% of \nasymptomatic knees 1 year after surge ry and in 12.5%  of individuals  2 years after surgery [61] . Serial  bone  scans \nmay be more  helpful  than a single  examination  [119] . Generally,  increased  uptake  on the delayed  images  but not \non the blood- pool phase is thought  to be due to loosening rather  than to infection  [60]. Normal  scans are most  \nhelpful  and are characterized  by a high NPV,  indicating  that loosening or infection  is unlikely.  A potential false  \nnegative ; however,  may occur  if there is loosening at the cement \u2013prosthetic  interface that does not incite  new bone  \nformation  [66].", "Around  10% to 30% of the \npatients  report  ongoing pain or are not satisfied  with the result  [9]. Factors,  which  contribute  to patient  \ndissatisfaction , include  unmet  expectations,  functional  limitations,  and postoperative  complications  including pain \n[10]. Most  TKA  patients  expe rience improved outcomes  and long implant survival,  with long-term  TKA failure  \nrates of <1% per year [5]. The growth in the number  of primary  TKA  procedures  has been  accompanied  by increased  \nrates of TKA revision  procedures  [1]. Revision  procedures  for TKAs have  increased  by 5.4 procedures  per 100,000  \npersons  per decade over the period from  1990  to 2002,  with a mean  revision  burden of 8.2%  [11]. Nearly  1.5 million  \nof those  with primary  knee  replacement  are 50 to 69 years  of age, underscoring a large population at risk for revision  \nsurgery  and long-term  complications  [5].

Infection  was the most  common  reason  for early  revision  (<2 years after the \ninitial TKA) , and aseptic loosening was the most  common  reason  for late revision.  Compared  with a review  \nperformed  by the same  author  in 2002 [13], polyethylene  wear  is no longer  the major  cause  of failure , and the \npercentages of revisions  for polyethylene  wear,  instability, arthrofibrosis,  malalignment,  and extensor  mechanism  \ndeficiency  have  all decreased."], ["Staphylococcus  aureus  and coagulase-negative  Staphylococcus  species,  including  Staphylococcus  epidermidis,  are \nthe most  common organisms  associated  with these infections  [46]. Both  clinical  findings  and laboratory tests may \nserve useful  in addition  to imaging  studies.  Low-grade  or chronic  TKA  infections  may be difficult to diagnose  \npreoperatively.  Duff  et al [18] noted that diagnosis  of infection  was not obvious  in 53% of knees before  revision  \narthroplasty.  Pain is the most  common  presenting  symptom  of infection, but pain is a nonspecific finding [47]. In \nacute infection,  findings  such as pain,  swelling,  warmth,  erythema,  and fever  are common,  whereas chronic  \ninfections  may be manifested  by pain alone  [44]. Night  pain or pain at rest is characteristic of infection, whereas  \npain on weightbearing  is more  characteristic of mechanical  loosening.  Some  authors  suggest  that infection  needs to \nbe excluded  in all patients  with pain persisting  >6 months  after joint replacement  [18]. \nLaboratory findings  in the setting  of TKA infection  are often  nonspecific.  Peripheral  leukocyte  counts  are not \nelevated  in most  patients  with infected  prostheses.  Erythrocyte  sedimentation  rates (ESRs) are abnormal  in patients  \nwith infection, but this finding  may also be seen in uninfected  patients,  limiting  the usefulness of the test [48]. A \nretrospective review of 68 patients  undergoing hip and knee  revision  surgery  indicated  that C-reactive protein  (CRP)  \nwas significantly  higher  in patients  with infection  compared  with those  with loosening (sensitivity  of 79% for all \nprostheses) ; however , a normal  CRP  level  did not exclude  infection  [49].", "CRP  has a sensitivity  of 73% to 91% and \na specificity  of 81% to 86% for the diagnosis  of prosthetic  knee  infection  when  a cutoff  of \u226513.5 mg/L  is used [44]. \nAlthough CRP  can be elevated  after surgery,  under  normal  circumstances  it generally  returns  to baseline within  2 \nmonths  [44]. A large multicenter  study found CRP  and joint aspiration  to be the most  useful  tools  to diagnose  \ninfection  [50]. In an attempt  to construct  an algorithm  for evaluating  TKA infection,  Savarino  et al [51] found that \nabnormal  results  for at least 2 of 3 tests (CRP  [cutoff  0.93 mg/L],  ESR [cutoff 27 mm/h],  and fibrinogen  [cutoff  \n432 mg/dL])  led to accurate results for the diagnosis  of infection  (sensitivity, 93%;  specificity,  100%;  accuracy,  \n97%) . More  recently,  interle ukin-6  has also shown  promise  for diagnosing  infection , with higher  predictive  values \nthan most  other  serologic  markers [52], and has shown  excellent  sensitivity  for detecting  infection  after TKA when  \ncombined with CRP  [53]. The American  Academy  of Orthopaedi c Surgeons  (AAOS ) guidelines  strongly  \nrecommend  the use of ESR, CRP , and serum  interleukin -6 testing  for patients  being assessed  for periprosthetic  joint \ninfection  [54]. Serologic  tests can be hard to interpret  when  underlying inflamm atory  arthropathy is present  [28]. \nMore  recently,  the use of an alpha -defensin  laboratory  test has been  described  for the diagnosis  of periprosthetic  \njoint infection.", "Li et al [95] also reported  a different  lamellated  and hyperintense  appearance of the synovium  in infected  \njoints, which  can be differentiated  from  frond -like and hypertrophied synovium  associated  with particle -induced \nsynovitis  and from  homogeneous  fluid -signal  intensity  effusion  associated  with a nonspecific  synovitis.  MRI with \nmetal  artifact  reduction technique  has also been  shown to detect  osteolysis that is not visible  on radiographs  [96,97] . \nUS Knee  \nUS has a limited  role in the workup of periprosthetic  infection, but it can be readily  used to assess soft tissues,  \nincluding  the presence of edema,  hyperemia,  and fluid  collections  about  the knee  joint in patients with TKA .

Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and \nit can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain \nwith the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. \nTypically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain \npersists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  \nimaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated \nthat approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the \nprior year) radiographs [2 ]. \nThis document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  \u22655 years of age.", "MR Arthrography  Knee  \nMR arthrography is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with s igns of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  \nUS Knee  \nUS is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  \nBone Scan Knee  \nRadionuclide bone scan is usually not indicated to evaluate patients with signs of prior  (chronic) osseous knee \ninjury.  \nImage -Guided Aspiration Knee  \nJoint aspiration is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  \nSummary of Recommendations  \n\u2022 Variant 1:  Radiographs  of the knee  are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of  chronic knee pain in \npatients greater than or equal to 5 years of age.  \n\u2022 Variant 2:  MRI knee without  IV contrast is usually appropriate in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of \nage with chronic knee pain when initial knee  radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion.  \n\u2022 Variant 3:  MRI knee without  IV contrast is usually appropriate  in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of \nage with chronic knee pain when initial knee radiographs demonstrate OCD,  loose bodies, or history of \ncartilage or meniscal repair.  \n\u2022 Variant 4:  (1) MRI knee without IV contrast  or (2)  knee aspiration or (3)  CT knee without  IV contrast may \nbe appropriate  in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of age with chronic knee pain when initial \nradiographs de monstrate degenerative changes or chondrocalcinosis. While MRI knee without  IV contrast \nmay be appropriate more often, knee aspiration and CT knee without IV contrast may be appropriate in \nspecific instances detailed in the narrative. On occasion, these ex aminations  may complement each other  with \nmore than one being appropriate .", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 6 Chronic Knee Pain  of age having an asymptomatic meniscal tear , and the likelihood of a meniscal tear being present in either a \npainful or asymptomatic knee not significantly different in patients 45 to 55 years of age [20,21]. \nBone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the \nsubchondral bone.  New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or \npatients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee \npain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the \norigin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. \nSubchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed \nspontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to \nelderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs \noften initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, \nand progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is \nsuspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria\n\u00ae \ntopic on \u201c Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae \u201d [28]. \nSome patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using \nquantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs \nexhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ]."], ["Within  the limitation  of the contrast  resolution  of CT, some  extra-\narticular  pathologic  entities, such as a large,  distended  bursa  may be evident  on CT.

They  evaluate anatomic detail  and previous  surgeries  \nand are useful  to evaluate for other  causes of pain, such as radiopaque  foreign  body,  soft-tissue gas, fracture,  \ndegenerative changes,  neuropathic  arthropathy , or tumor.  Radiographs  are insensitive  in the detection  of early  \nstages of acute osteomyelitis  [11]."], ["Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  \nusually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, \nosteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite \nversus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess \nwith radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton\u2019s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other \ncauses of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg\u2019s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals \nor soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . \nThough radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in \npatients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The \ncombination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a \nspecificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15]. \nUS Foot  \nUltrasound (US) is usually not indicate d as the first imaging  study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain, but may \nbe performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of pathologic conditions of the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, \nand other conditions such as tarsal tunnel syndrome, Morton\u2019s  neuroma , plantar plate tears,  and intermetatarsal \nbursitis. \nVariant 2: Persistent posttraumatic foot pain.

In the presence of localized  tenderness,  one study  report ed US \nsensitivity  and specificity  of 100%  and 96% for fifth metatarsal  fractures and 40% and 93% for navicular  \nfractures,  respectively  [23].

Initial imaging.  \nMultiple  conditions  or scenarios preclude  the use of the Ottawa rules for determining  if imaging  is necessary  \n[5,6] . It has been  reported  that the Ottawa rules  for the foot should not be used or should be used with great  \ncaution  in the following  clinical  situations:  penetrating  trauma,  pregnancy,  any skin wound,  transferred  with \nradiographs  already  taken,  >10 days after trauma,  a return  visit for continued  traumatic  foot pain,  in the setting  of \npolytrauma,  altered  sensorium,  neurologic  abnormality  affecting  the foot, or underlying  bone  disease [7]. \nRadiograph y Foot  \nIf a foot fracture is suspected  in a neurologically  compromised  patient, including patients  with diabetic  \nneuropathy , the foot should  be radiographed.", "Although there is no relevant literature  to support the routine clinical use of US in the \ndiagnosis of CRPS type II, high-resolu tion US may have a role giving its increasing use in nerve assessment [23] . \nVariant 3: Chronic metatarsalgia including plantar great toe pain. Radiographs negative or equivocal. \nClinical concern includes sesamoiditis, Morton\u2019s  neuroma, intermetatarsal bursitis, chronic plantar plate \ninjury, or Freiberg\u2019s infraction. Next imaging study.  \nBone Scan Foot  \nPlanar b one scintigraphy has low anatomic resolution and has been shown to be a nonspecific technique to assess \nthe hallucal sesamoids [24]. However, bone scintigraphy with single -photon emission computed tomography \n(SPECT)/CT increases contrast resolution and anatomic localization of foci with increased osteoblastic activity  \n[25]. Bone scintigraphy may demonstrate increased uptake in pathologic conditions affecting the fir st metatarsal \nsesamoids not evident on radiographs. A less dramatic uptake is noted in stress fractures, which may be helpful to \ndifferentiate between them and acute fractures [26]. When an indeter minate linear lucency is visualized on \nradiographs, a negative bone scintigraphy suggest s sesamoid bipartition [12] . Other conditions that may present \npositive findings on Tc -99m -methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scint igraphy include sesamoiditis, \ninflammatory or deposition arthropathies, osteoarthritis , and osteonecrosis [39]. In Freiberg\u2019s infraction, a \nphotopenic center with a hyperactive collar may be identified on early stages on high -resolution Tc -99m -MDP bone \nscintigraphy [27]. \nCT Foot  \nCT may be useful to confirm suspected sesamoid stress fractures on radiographs and to distinguish between a stress \nfracture and a bipartite sesamoid with more precision than conventional radiography [28] ."], ["ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 10 Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture  Variant 5: Confirmed stress (fatigue) fracture, excluding vertebrae . Follow -up imaging study for  \u201creturn -\nto-play\u201d evaluation . \nSee variants 1  through  3. On initial diagnosis, MRI can be used to  predict t ime to return to play in athletes. \nFredericson et al  [48] retrospectively correlated return to activity with an MRI grading system based on the \npattern of periosteal and marrow edema on T1-weighted  and fat -suppressed T 2-weighted sequences. Similar \nfindings were confirmed in other studies  [49-51] , including  that the finding of abnormal cortical signal intensity \nor a fracture line was of prognostic value [ 51] and that MRI performed better in predicting return to activity than \nradiographs , bone scintigraphy, or CT [50,52]. \nA recent prospective study in university athletes found that MRI grading s everity, total-body bone mineral density \nevaluated by dual -energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and location of injury (ie , cortical or trabecular bone)  \nwere important variables for predicting time to full return to sport [ 31]. In this study, periosteal edema as \ndescribed by Fredericson et al [ 48] was not associated with return to sport . Using the modified grading scale and a \nmultiple regression model, for every 1- unit increase in MRI grade, the time to full return to sport increased by \napproximately 48 days [31] . Furthermore, trabecular st ress injuries (eg , femur neck and pubic bone ) were \nassociated with a longer time to return to sport than cortical bone stress injuries. In addition, decreased bone \nmineral density leads to increased time to return to sport . Therefore, bone mineral density provides additional \ndiagnostic and prognostic information [31]. The model of MRI  grade, trabecular versus cortical bone sit e, and \ntotal-body bone mineral density a ccounted for 68% of the variation in time to return to sport [ 31].", "Finally, stress fractures of the femoral head are high  risk in healthy patients and , if not recognized promptly, have \nincreased  rates of delayed union, nonunion, displacement, and avascular necrosis [17]. Given the importance of \nrecognizing these high-risk fractures in the femoral head and neck, MRI is the preferred second -line study after  \ninitial negative  radiographs to prevent delayed diagnosis.  \nVariant 3: Suspected stress (fatigue) fracture, excluding hip  and vertebrae. Negative radiographs. Next \nimaging study.  \nSee variant 2. Certain stress fractures are considered high  risk based on a tendency for nonunion or delayed union. \nHigh -risk stress fractures include the anterior tibial diaphysis, lateral femoral neck and femoral head (see variant \n2), patella, medial malleolus, navicular, fifth metatarsal base, proximal second metatarsal, tibial hallux sesamoid, \nand talus  [43]. \nThe second -line test to diagnose a stress fracture should be guided by the location of the patient \u2019s pain and \nlikelihood of high-risk injury. A follow -up radiographic examination has increased sensitivity compared to initial \nradiographs [8] but is less sensitive than MRI. MRI is extremely sensitive and demonstrates stress abnormalities \nas early as bone scintigraphy and with as much sensitivity [ 11-14]. The recent literature favors MRI as the \nprocedure of choice for making an early diagnosis of both varieties of stress fractures [ 15-28 ]. MRI is also \nconsiderably more specifi c than bone scintigraphy [ 19,23]. Stress injuries in athletes that are not identified and \nmanaged in a timel y fashion can progress to more serious fractures. Preventive strategies, including identifying \nand modifying risk factors, may help deter progression to frank fractures [31,44,45]. \nA circumstance that deserves specific attention is the longitudinal stress fracture, particularly in the tibia. Up to \n25% may appear n ormal on radiographs, but CT or MRI findings are characteristic [ 13,46].", "Furthermore, certain athletic activities often result in specific sites of fatigue  fracture, such as olecranon process \nfractures in javelin throwers and baseball pitchers, proximal femur and tibial stress fractures in runners, and  tarsal  \nnavicular stress fractures in basketball players [ 36-38] . Correlat ion of  clinical history, pattern , and site recognition \nwith radiographic findings  is usually specific [1,2,4,5,7]. Nevertheless, stress fractures are frequently occult on \ninitial radiographs  [1], with conventional radiographs having a sensitivity of 15% to 35% [8]. Early radiographic \nfindings are often nonspecific (subtle periosteal reaction , gray cortex sign) or even nonexistent. Late radiographic \nfindings are often suggestive in appearance  and include  linear sclerosis (often perpe ndicular to the major \ntrabecular lines), periosteal reaction , patchy endosteal sclerosis, and soft -tissue swelling . Additionally, \nradiographs may remain negative depending on the timing of re imaging , the patient\u2019s metabolic bone status, and \nthe type and lo cation of the fracture. Thus, radiographs are specific but significantly insensitive. Despite this \nlimitation, all authorities agree that radiographs should be the initial imaging modality; if the findings are \nconclusive, no further imaging need be perform ed. \nVariant 2: S uspected stress (fatigue) fracture, hip. Negative radiographs. Next imaging study.   \nShort -term (10  to 14 days) follow -up radiographs are more sensitive than initial radiographs secondary to overt \nbone reaction in the location of the stress fracture. Follow -up radiographic sensitivity increases to 30 % to 70%"], ["Imaging findings  should not be interpreted  in isolation.

In 2010,  16.3 \nmillion  health  care visits  to hospitals  and physician  offices were related  primarily  to neck  pain [1]. The Global  \nBurden  of Disease 2010 Study  identified  neck  pain as the fourth  leading  cause of years lost to disability [2], with \nmost  epidemiological  studies reporting an annual  prevalence ranging between  15% and 50% [3-8]. Although  most  \nepisodes resolve,  nearly  50% of individuals  continue  to experience ongoing or recurrent  pain [9].", "Radiculopathies  may result  from  compressive causes  related to narrowing of the neural foramina, such as by facet \nor uncovertebral joint hypertrophy, or from associated dis c bulging or herniation  and degenerative spondylosis  in \nthe absence of a history  of diabetes or red flag symptom s [31].  A recent meta-analysis assessing the positive \npredictive value of physical examination tests in the setting of a clinical history of cervical radiculopathy \nconcluded there was limited evidence for a correlation between physical examination findings and MRI evidence \nof cervical nerve root compression [32].  This may be due to a high rate of both false -positive and false-negative \nfindings on MRI in the setting of suspected cervical radiculopathy [33 ]. Most cases of acute cervical neck pain \nwith radicular symptoms resolve spontaneously or with conse rvative treatment measures [31, 34]. \nIn absence of red flag symptoms, imaging may not be required at time of initial presentation [1 ] as spondylotic \nchanges are commonly identified on radi ographs and MRI in patients >30 years of age and correlate poorly with \nthe presence of neck pain [20-23]. Although the diagnostic accuracy of red flag symptoms is not validated for the \ncervical spine, the Bone  and Joint  Decade 2000 -2010 Task Force on Neck Pain and Its Associated Disorders [1] \nrecommended the adoption of a similar system for cervical and neck pain, with red flags that include  trauma, \nmalignancy, prior neck surgery, spinal cord injury, systemic diseases \u2014inclu ding ankylosing spondylitis, diffuse \nidiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, inflammatory arthritis, suspected infection \u2014history of intravenous drug use, \nintractable pain despite therapy, or tenderness to palpation over a vertebral body.

Dynamic examination shows the relationship of the aponeurosis to the \nretracted ligament stump [65] . \nUS allows for diagnosis of pulley system injuries [ 66,67]. \nBone Scan Hand \nBone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  \nVariant 6: Initial radiographs showing metaca rpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, or distal \ninterphalangeal joint malalignment in the absence of fracture.

MRI may be used to assess \ncapsule and collateral ligament injuries of the proximal interphalangeal  and metacarpophalangeal joints [68]. \nFor flexor tendon injuries, Rubin et al [ 69] reported a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of  100% in cadavers.", "Bone Scan Wrist  \nBone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  \nVariant 4: Initial radiographs showing distal radioulnar joint or carpal malalignment in the absence of \nfracture.

The CT protocol should include \nimaging of both wrists in maximal pronation, neutral position, and maximal supination.  \nCT examin ation with coronal, sagittal, and 3 -D reformed images help demonstrate the extent of injury and help in \ntreatment planning, particularly in cases of chronic perilunate dislocation [ 55]. \nCT Arthrography  Wrist  \nDistal radioulnar joint instability and traumatic triangular f ibrocartilage injuries can be evaluated with CT \narthrography [56,57]. \nMRI Wrist  \nDistal radioulnar joint instability and traumatic triangular fibrocartilage injuries are usually associated with fluid \nin the distal radioulnar joint , which aids in the evaluation of the triangular fibrocartilage components on \nconventional MRI.  \nMR Arthrography  Wrist  \nMR arthrograph y increases the diagnostic accuracy for proximal lamina (foveal) triangular fibrocartilage tears \n[56,57]. \nUS Wrist  \nUS is not indicated in this clinical setting. \nBone Scan Wrist  \nBone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  \nVariant 5: Acute hand fracture on radiographs.

Unknown etiology. Initial imaging.  \nBone Scan Foot  \nThere is no relevant literature  to support t he use of nuclear medicine studies as the first imaging  study  in the \nevaluation of chronic foot pain.  \nCT Foot  \nThere is no relevant literature to support the use of CT as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot \npain.  \nMRI Foot  \nThere is no r elevant literature  to support the use of MRI as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot \npain.  \nRadiography Foot  \nConventional radiography can be useful to distinguish among different causes of chronic foot pain and is usually \nthe first imag ing study in evaluating patients with chronic foot pain.  \nThe value of radiographs in the diagnosis of tarsal coalitions has been extensively demonstrated. Overall \nsensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs \nin the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral \nand oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar \ncoalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs \non the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have \nbeen found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable \nmethods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  \nRadiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review \nby Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for \nradiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.  \nRadiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain.", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 9 Chronic Foot Pain  \u2022 Variant 2:  MRI foot without IV  contrast or 3 -phase bone scan foot is usually appropriate as the next imaging \nstudy after negative or equivocal radiographs  in patients with pers istent posttraumatic foot pain when  clinical \nconcern includes CRPS type I.
