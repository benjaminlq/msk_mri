Nonlocalized shoulder pain. Negative radiographs . Next imaging \nstudy. \nAppropriately positioned  radiographs can exclude shoulder dislocation and most displaced fractures as the \netiology for post -traumatic shoulder pain. In the setting of normal shoulder radiographs, the most common causes \nof post -traumatic shoulder pain are soft -tissue injuries such  as rotator cuff and labral tears.  \nMRI Shoulder  \nNoncontrast MRI is a reasonable imaging study in the setting of acute nonlocalized traumatic shoulder pain and \nnoncontributory radiographs. In the acute trauma setting, noncontrast MRI may be preferred to MR arthrography , \nas acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint effusion for assessment of intra -articular \nsoft-tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic \npathology such as capsular and ligament tears [34,35]. MRI is also sensitive for diagnosing bone marrow \ncontusion and has  been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries in pediatric patients [ 36,37]. \nMR Arthrography  Shoulder  \nMR arthrography has been found to be superior to noncontrast MRI in the diagnosis of labroligamentous and \npartial -thickness rotator cuff tears [17,19]. In the acute trauma setting, however, noncontrast MRI may be \npreferred to MR arthrography because acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint \neffusion for assessment of intra-arti cular soft -tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing \nextra-articular soft -tissue traumatic pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [ 34,35]. MRI is also sensitive \nfor diagnosing bone marrow contusion and has been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries \nin pediatric patients [ 36,37]. \nUS Shoulder  \nUS has limited usefulness in patients with traumatic shoulder pain that cannot be localized to the rotator cuff or \nbiceps tendon. I n the post -traumatic setting, US has been shown to detect abnormalities, including proximal \nhumeral fractures [25]; however, recent studies on US performed for non specific shoulder pain have had \nconflicting results. US  for persistent shoulder pain after trauma has been found to diagnose significant pathology, \nprimarily fractures and rotator cuff tears, in 90% of patients [ 25]. However, 40% of patients presenting with \nnonspecific shoulder pain were found to have no significant pathology on US [38]. Additionally,  US has been \ndemonstrated to be inferior to MRI in assessment of labroligamentous, osseous, and rotator cuff pathology [ 17]. \nUS can b e considered as a screening tool in patients with persistent nonspecific shoulder pain after trauma, \nparticularly in an older patient population in whom rotator cuff tears are more common. However, a low threshold \nshould be maintained for performing additi onal imaging in the setting of a noncontributory shoulder US  \nexam ination . \nCT Shoulder  \nCT has virtually no usefulness in diagnosing common traumatic soft -tissue injuries such as rotator cuff tears, \nlabroligamentous injuries, and muscle tears. Although CT is  the gold standard for diagnosing and characterizing \nfractures, MRI has been shown to be equivalent to CT in diagnosing the nondisplaced fractures that are typically \nmissed on radiographs.  \nCT Arthrography  Shoulder  \nCT is inferior to MRI and US  in diagnosing virtually all extra -articular traumatic soft -tissues injuries. CT is \nconsidered the gold standard in identifying fractures . However, MRI has shown to be equivalent to CT in \nassessing bone loss [12,18], and MRI is usually adequate for diagnosing the nondisplaced fractures that are \ntypically missed on conventional radiographs. CT arthrography is able to reliably evaluat e for glenohumeral \ncartilage injury, SLAP tears, and labroligamentous injuries [ 12,39] but is generally considered inferior to MRI in \ndiagnosing  rotator cuff and soft -tissue Bankart lesions [ 12].", "However, this is not common \npractice, and US has been shown to be inferior to MRI in diagnosing the common structural abnormalities \nassociated with shoulder instability, such as labroligamentous injuries, Hill -Sachs lesions, and partial rotator cuff \ntears [17]. \nFDG -PET/CT  Skull Base to Mid-Thigh \nThere is no role for FDG-PET/CT  in assessment of shoulder instability . \nBone Scan  Shoulder  \nThere is no role for bone scintigraphy in assessment of shoulder instability . \nVariant 7: Traumatic shoulder pain.

Next imaging study.  \nMR Arthrography  Shoulder  \nMR arthrography  has been reported to have a high sensitivity for detection of labral injury, r anging from 86%  to \n100% [20,59,62-65] ; however, the issue of  selection bias is inherent in the design of many of these retrospective", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 12 Shoulder Pain \u2013Traumatic  MR Arthrography  Shoulder  \nMR arthrography is the preferred exam ination  for the evaluation of subacute shoulder dislocations or recurrent \nshoulder instability. MRI has been shown to have similar performance to CT in the evaluation of Hill-Sachs \nlesions and glenoid bone loss [12,18]. MR arthrography has also been found to be reliable in diagnosi ng anterior \nshoulder instability and labroligamentous injuries [58,59]. MR arthrography has specifically o utperformed \nnoncontrast MRI in assessment of glenohumeral ligament and anterior labral injuries [ 17,19], which ar e \ncommonly seen in shoulder instability. MR arthrogr aphy has also outperformed noncontrast MRI in diagnosis of \nrotator cuff tears [17,19], which is a common associated finding in older patients with shoulder dislocation. \nHowever, high sensitivities reported for MR arthrography in the detection of labral pathology may not be \napplicable to patients with clinically unstable shoulders. A retrospective review of 90 patients with clinically \nunstable shoulders selected for arthroscopy [ 60] found that MR arthrography had a sensitivity of 65% for \ndetection of labral  tears. The authors proposed that this discrepancy with prior studies was the result of different \npatient selection criteria (clinically unstable in their study versus less-specific symptoms such as shoulder pain in \nothers) and the interpretation of MR art hrography by experienced musculoskeletal radiologists [ 60]. For this \ndocument, it is assumed the procedure is performed and interpreted by an expert.  \nMRI Shoulder  \nMRI without contrast may be pre ferred to MR arthrography in the setting of acute shoulder dislocation when a \npost-traumatic joint effusion is present to provide sufficient visualization of soft -tissue structures. In the subacute \nor chronic setting, the glenohumeral joint effusion is usually too small to provide adequate joint distention for \noptimal assessment  of soft -tissue structures. Non contrast MRI has been shown to be inferior to MR arthrography \nin diagnosing labroligamentous and rotator cuff injuries [17,19]. Non contrast MRI performs comparably to CT in \nevaluating glenoid and humeral head bone loss [ 12,18], which may obviate the need for noncontrast CT . \nCT Arthrography  Shoulder  \nCT arthrography is effective in evaluation of shoulder instability. CT arthrogr aphy is comparable to MR \narthrography in the diagnosis of Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions [12] , and moderate agreement has been found \nbetween readers for diagnosing ant erior capsule laxity on CT arthrography. However, CT arthrography has been \nshown to be inferior to MR arthrography in assessing partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [12], which makes CT \narthrography less desirable in older patients with dislocation/instability where rotator cuff tears are common. CT \narthrography may be considered in a patient with shoulder dislocation/instabili ty and contraindication to MRI.  \nCT Shoulder  \nNoncontrast CT has historically been performed to assess bone loss in patients with recurrent dislocation or \nchronic instability. However, recent studies have shown MRI to be equivalent to CT in assessment of glenoid and \nhumeral head bone loss [12,18], which places in question the need for noncontrast CT in the assessment of \nshoulder instability. Noncontrast CT is als o unable to assess rotator cuff and labroligamentous pathology \ncommonly seen in shoulder dislocations/instability. In general, CT should be reserved for patients with a \ncontraindication to MRI or patients in whom MRI assessment of bone loss is limited.  \nUS Shoulder  \nThere is no defined role for US  in the assessment of shoulder dislocation  or instability. There is a potential limited \nrole for use of dynamic US in assessing Hill -Sachs lesion engagement [ 61]."], ["Noncontrast  and contrast -enhanced  MRI have  overall similar  diagnostic  utility  for evaluation  of the sacroiliac joints  \nin axSpA  [107-111] .

Studies  have  shown  widely varying  \ndegrees of isolated  spinal  involvement  on MRI in axSpA  ranging from  1% to 49% [19,59-63,114,115] . Therefore,  \nimag ing of the spine  is beneficial  for patients  in whom  there is suspicion  for axSpA  but imaging  of the sacroiliac \njoints  has been  negative.  Some  authors  have  shown  the utility  of using  whole -spine  or whole -body  MRI to identify  \nthe burden of disease rather  than selecting  specific areas of the spine  to image  because findings  may be potentially  \nisolated  to any portion of the spine  [10,59,63,89,114,120-122] . \nThe spine  MRI  findings  of axSpA  include  the active inflammatory  changes of spondylitis  and spondylodiscitis,  the \ninflammatory  changes of the costovertebral  joints,  costotransverse joints,  and facet  joints  and areas of enthesitis  \nalong other  vertebral  ligamentous  attachments [123] .

Radiographs are usually sufficient for  the evaluation \nof osseous \u201cmallet\u201d injuries, which include bony avulsion at the insertion of the extensor mechanism of the finger \nto the distal interphalangeal joint [16]. In these injuries, involvement of more than one -third of the articular \nsurface usually requires operative fixation.  Palmar displacement of the distal phalanx or an interfragmentary gap \nof >3 mm is also an indication for surgery [ 16]. With extensor tendon injuries, radiographs are commonly used to \nassess for bone involve ment and determine need for operative fixation [ 17]. \nCT Area of Interest  \nIn patients with intra -articular fractures seen on radiography , CT shows articular fracture fragment displacement, \ndepression, and comminution more accurately than conventional radiographs [ 7,9,10].

CT shows intra-articular extension of distal radius fractures more frequently than \nradiography.

Kransdorf, MD.o \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nHand injuries account for approximately 20% of emergency department visits [ 1]. According to the National \nHospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey , 1.5% of all emergency department visits involve  hand and wrist \nfractu res. Distal radius fractures are especially common, accounting for up to 18% of fractures in the elderly [ 2,3]. \nBecause of increasing rates of osteoporosis, the incidence of distal radius fractures has been increasing [ 4]. \nAlthough most distal radius fractures in e lderly patients are managed non operatively, the use of internal fixation is \nincreasing. Internal fixation has a much higher cost than nonopera tive treatment as well as increased rates of \nhospitalization [5]. \nFor most patients with trauma to the hand and wrist, conventional radiographs provide sufficient diagnostic \ninformation to guide the treating physician.  However, delayed diagnosis is common because distal radius and \nscaphoid fractures may be radiographically occult  [6]. When initial radiographs  are normal but there is high \nclinical suspicion for fracture, further imaging with additional radiographic pr ojections, CT, or MRI  is \nappropriate . If associated soft -tissue injury is clinically suspected, CT, CT arthrography, MR I, MR arthrography, \nor ultrasound (US) may be indicated  [7-10]. \nSuccessful treatment of distal radius fractures requires restoration of radial length, inclination, and tilt, as well as \nthe realignment of the articular fracture fragments [9,11]. The presence of a coronally  oriented fracture line, die -\npunch depression, or more than three articular fracture fragments are common indications for operative reduction \n[8]. Operative fixation resulting in < 2 mm of residual articular surface step-off is usually considered necessary to \navoid long-term complications , such as osteoarthritis [9 ,12]. \nDiscussion of Procedures by Variant  \nVariant 1: Acute blunt or penetrating trauma to the hand or wrist.

According to the National \nHospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey , 1.5% of all emergency department visits involve  hand and wrist \nfractu res. Distal radius fractures are especially common, accounting for up to 18% of fractures in the elderly [ 2,3]. \nBecause of increasing rates of osteoporosis, the incidence of distal radius fractures has been increasing [ 4]. \nAlthough most distal radius fractures in e lderly patients are managed non operatively, the use of internal fixation is \nincreasing. Internal fixation has a much higher cost than nonopera tive treatment as well as increased rates of \nhospitalization [5]. \nFor most patients with trauma to the hand and wrist, conventional radiographs provide sufficient diagnostic \ninformation to guide the treating physician.  However, delayed diagnosis is common because distal radius and \nscaphoid fractures may be radiographically occult  [6]. When initial radiographs  are normal but there is high \nclinical suspicion for fracture, further imaging with additional radiographic pr ojections, CT, or MRI  is \nappropriate . If associated soft -tissue injury is clinically suspected, CT, CT arthrography, MR I, MR arthrography, \nor ultrasound (US) may be indicated  [7-10]. \nSuccessful treatment of distal radius fractures requires restoration of radial length, inclination, and tilt, as well as \nthe realignment of the articular fracture fragments [9,11]. The presence of a coronally  oriented fracture line, die -\npunch depression, or more than three articular fracture fragments are common indications for operative reduction \n[8]. Operative fixation resulting in < 2 mm of residual articular surface step-off is usually considered necessary to \navoid long-term complications , such as osteoarthritis [9 ,12]. \nDiscussion of Procedures by Variant  \nVariant 1: Acute blunt or penetrating trauma to the hand or wrist. Initial imaging.  \nRadiograph y Area of Interest  \nRadiography is  always indicated as the initial imaging for suspected acute hand and wrist trauma.  For m ost joints \nof the extremities, especially those involving the wrist, hand, and fingers, a radiographic examination that \nincludes only 2 views is not adequate for detecting fractures [13]. For patients with suspected  distal radius \nfractures, a 3-view examination  of the wrist  usually includes a posteroanterior (PA) , a lateral, and a 45\u00b0 \nsemi pronated oblique view  [11].

Radiographs are usually sufficient for  the evaluation \nof osseous \u201cmallet\u201d injuries, which include bony avulsion at the insertion of the extensor mechanism of the finger \nto the distal interphalangeal joint [16]. In these injuries, involvement of more than one -third of the articular \nsurface usually requires operative fixation.  Palmar displacement of the distal phalanx or an interfragmentary gap \nof >3 mm is also an indication for surgery [ 16]. With extensor tendon injuries, radiographs are commonly used to \nassess for bone involve ment and determine need for operative fixation [ 17]. \nCT Area of Interest  \nIn patients with intra -articular fractures seen on radiography , CT shows articular fracture fragment displacement, \ndepression, and comminution more accurately than conventional radiographs [ 7,9,10]. CT measurements of \narticular surface gap and step -off are more reproducible than radiographs [7]. The addition of 3- D surface -\nrendered reconstructions to the standard 2 -D CT images has been shown to change operative management in up to \n48% of intra -articular distal radius fractures [8]. \nThere is no evidence to support the use of CT with intravenous  (IV) contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist \ntrauma.  \nMRI Area of Interest  \nMRI is not indicated initially in this clinical setting. \nUS Area of Interest  \nUS is not indicated initially in this clinical setting. \nBone Scan Area of  Interest  \nBone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  \nVariant 2: Suspect acute hand or wrist trauma. Initial radiographs nega tive or equivocal. Next imaging \nstudy. \nRadiograph y Area of Interest  \nIn patients with clinical suspicion of hand or wrist fracture and negative radiographs, one option is to place the \npatient in a short arm cast and repeat the radiographs at 10  to 14 days [ 13]. The downside of this option is that it \nresults in delay of diagnosis , which may lead to functional impairment . \nCT Area of Interest  \nWhen the initial radiographs are equivocal, CT  without IV contrast  is commonly used to exclude or confirm \nsuspected wrist fractures [18]. CT shows intra-articular extension of distal radius fractures more frequently than \nradiography.  Three-dimensional reconstructions can be particularly helpful in preoperative planning for complex \narticular injuries  [7,8]. \nCT should be used to exclude an occult fracture of the upper extremity. Unlike MRI, CT cannot evaluate for \nconcomitant ligamentous injuries  [19-21 ]. \nCT is useful in diagnosing injuries that are difficult to recognize on radiographs, such as carpometacarpal joint \nfracture dislocations. For metacarpal and digital  fractures, CT is usually not indicated during acute injury [ 22]. \nThere is no evidence to support the use of CT with IV contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist trauma.  \nMRI Area o f Interest  \nWhen initial radiographs are normal but there is high clinical suspicion for fracture, MRI without IV contrast can \ndetect fractures of the distal radius and carpal bones [12,23-25] . One study of patients in which the radiographic \nfindings did not explain the clinical symptoms reported that the MRI led to a change in diagnosis in 55% of \npatients and a change in patient management in 66%  [12]. However, another study of patients with acutely injured \nwrists reported that the MRI did not predict the need for treatment better than the combination of physical \nexamination and radiography [ 23]. More importantly, there was no difference in outcomes  with MRI compared \nwith radiography [24]."], ["The results of the pelvic  radiograph can help the clinician  for the selection  of additional  imaging  \ntechniques  and for comparison  with studies such as MRI,  CT, radionuclide  bone  scans,  and fluoride  PET [13-15].", "Measurements can be performed  on radiography,  CT, and MRI [42-44,47,48] .

Kransdorf,  MD.o  \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nFractures of the proximal femur (commonly referred to as hip fractures)  are a frequent  source of morbidity and \nmortality in elderly osteoporotic patients [1]. Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type \nresult in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men \n[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs \nwill continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of \nlife following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays \nin diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -\nand long-term mortality [6-13]. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of hip fractures is critical. Hip fractures \ncannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded on the basis of physical exam ination  alone ; therefore , imaging plays a \nkey role in early  and accurate diagnosis [14] . \nThe biomechanics of proximal femoral and pelvic fractures that are a result of major trauma differs as these \ninjuries may be seen in any age group, often with additional accompanying high-velocity injuri es of the abdomen \nand pelvis . Motor vehicle \u2013related trauma is the most common  mechanism. Thorough evaluation of the hip may be \nsuperseded  in these instances by the need for resuscitation and diagnosis and treatment of more urgent associated \nvascular or solid organ injuries. Imaging plays an important role not only in the diagnosis of high-velocity \nfractures but also in characterizing fracture mechanism and morphology for treatment planning purposes.  \nHowever, imaging of high-velocity hip fractures occurs in the context of a broader trauma evaluation. A full \ndiscussion of the broader imaging workup of blunt trauma is beyond the scope of this paper and will be covered in \nthe upcoming ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae titled \u201cMajor Blunt Trauma\u201d and will be made available on the \nACR website  when completed . \nTreatment  for both intra - and extracapsular proximal femoral fractures in the elderly is typically surgical fixation  \nbecause of the risk of further fracture displacement and the dangers of prolonged immobilization in the elderly \n[15]. Joint replacement may be  performed for displaced fractures of the femoral neck where the risk of femoral \nhead avascular necrosis is high. Fractures from high -force trauma are also commonly treated with surgical \nfixation for stability to reduce the risk of post -traumatic osteo arthritis. \nDiscussion of Procedures by Variant  \nVariant 1:  Acute hip pain. Fall or minor trauma. Suspect fracture. Initial imaging.  \nRadiography Hip \nRadiography is the initial imaging modality of choice for assessment of acute hip pain with suspected fracture , \nwith the more advanced imaging modalities reserved for instances of clinically suspected fracture in the setting of \nnegative or equivocal radiographs. Radiographs are rapidly obtained and well tolerated by patients. When a \nfracture is demonstrated , freque ntly no more imaging is needed for treatment planning purposes [15 -17]."], ["ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 10 Acute Trauma to the Ankle  Rare pantalar dislocations without associated talar or other fracture can be assessed on CT or MRI and have high \nrates of osteonecrosis, osteoarthritis, and infection  [71]. \nMRI Ankle  \nMRI is the reference standard for ligamentous injury and assessment of stability , which is particularly important in \nathletes, in whom determination of grade (1, 2,  or 3) of syndesmotic ligament, anterior tibiofibular ligament , and \ndeltoid injuries is critica l for treatment planning and return to sport assessment [51] . \nLigamentous injuries can occur without fracture on radiography. Grossterlinden et al  [52] compared MRI and \nradiography and showed that 15% of ligamentous injuries (including sprains, partial tears, and complete tears) at \nthe syndesmosis in acute ankle injuries on M RI demonstra ted no fracture on radiography.  \nRare pantalar dislocations without associated talar or other fracture can be assessed on CT or MRI and have high \nrates of osteonecrosis, osteoarthritis, and infection  [71]. \nRadiography Ankle Stress Views  \nStress radiograph s may be useful in assessing syndesmotic instability, particularly in supination external rotation \nankle injuries according to the Lauge -Hansen classification. Lee et al [72]  noted that tibiotalar tilt angle and anterior \ntibiofibular space measurements were affected when the anterior tibiofibular and posterior talofibular ligaments \nwere injured (confirmed on MRI) in 299 patients . Lateral stress testing with widening of the tibiofibular clear space \nhas been shown to be  an indicator of syndesmotic injury , with the traditional external rotation stress test shown to \nbe a poor indicator when t he deltoid ligament is injured [73] . \nRadiography Leg \nMaisonneuve fracture (syndesmotic injury of the ankle in combination with a proximal fibular fracture) may be \noverlooked as a result of  lack of pain at the fibula. Careful palpation of the proximal fibula should be performed \nwith radiographic evaluation of the entire tibia and fibular if focal tenderness is present [74] . \nUS Ankle  \nUS is not typically the next line of evaluation  of syndesmotic injuries. Although some studies have suggested \nfocused US could be beneficial for ligamentous evaluation, others have shown limited utility in lateral ankle \nligament spr ains [75]. \nSummary of Recommendations  \nVariant 1: Ankle radiographs are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of patients 5 years of age or older with \nacute trauma to the ankle or acute trauma to the ankle with persistent pain for more than 1 week but less than 3 \nweeks with no exclusionar y criteria present and the OAR  are positive : 1.

Initial radiographs should \nbe followed by CT  and MR I [60,61] . These lesions are treated successfully with combined open approach and \narthroscop y. \nFractures  \nCT is the first -line imaging  study  after radiographs to determine extent, displacement , comminution, intra -articular \nextension , associated injuries,  and potential classification of fractures [48] . This is particularly important in subtalar, \ncalcaneal,  and talar fractures because of  the complex anatomy and in high -impact polytrauma or complex \ncomminuted injuries in which multiplanar CT imaging is recommended to help direct the preoperative planning \nevaluation process [62]. \nMRI Ankle  \nOsteochondral lesions  \nMRI without  IV contrast is co nsidered the study of choice for assessment of cartilage abnormalities and bone \ncontusions related to acquired  osteochondral lesion,  particularly in patients with symptoms of persistent pain, \nstiffness, locking, clicking , and ankle swelling  [22,55-57,63] . Although radiographs and CT depict ossific fragments \nand fracture lines, cartilage abnormalities and bone contusions related to osteochondral lesion are best seen on MRI. \nSeventy percent  of ankle fractures and 50% of ankle sprains have been shown to result in some variation of cartilage \ninjury [57,58,61,64] . \nFractures  \nAlthough CT is more commonly used as the next step in fracture assessment in  known fractures, MRI can be useful \nas a follow-up imaging modality for assessment of associated bone marrow contusions, stress injuries,  or fractures \n[65]. MRI is especially important in fracture sites such as the talus,  which are at higher risk for osteonecrosis. MR I \nis highly accurate for associated soft -tissue abnormalities including tendon entrapment/dislocation and for \nligamentous inju ries [66]. \nRadiography Ankle Broden\u2019s View  \nThe Broden view is a supine  flexed knee view with 30 \u00b0 to 45\u00b0 internal rotation that  can be used  for specific improved \nevaluation of the lateral process fracture of the talus (commonly known as snowboarder\u2019s fracture). It may be of \nuse when further evaluation of the talar fracture is needed.  \nUS Ankle  \nOsteochondra l lesion  \nUS is not the next step in this clinical scenario.  \nFractures  \nUS has been shown to be useful for identification of lateral malleolar, medial malleolar , and fifth metatarsal \nfractures [41] but is not conside red a first -line assessment tool  or next imaging study  in this clinical scenario.  \nVariant 6 : Adult or child 5 years of age or older. Acute trauma to the ankle. Radiographs negative for osseous \ninjury and physical examination or radiographs demonstrate alignment abnormality  suggesting \nsyndesmotic/ligamentous injury or dislocation. Next study. \nLateral sprain is more common than medial strain , with the anterior talofibular ligament most commonly tor n. High \nsprain and fractures are more common in high -collision sport injuries [60], with higher incidence of ankle injuries \nduring winter months [67] and increased incidence in military recruits [68]. Inversion injuries of the ankle account \nfor 25% of musculoskeletal system injuries and 50% of all sports -related injuries [1].  \nBone Scan Ankle  \nBone scan is not routinely the next line of imaging in this clinical scenario.  \nCT Ankle  \nCT is useful for evaluation of dislocation and can be used to detect  syndesmotic injuries, although MRI is better for \nsoft-tissue evaluation. Nault et al [69]  validated CT scan measurement s that  can identify syndesmotic injuries seen \non MRI (retrosp ective study of MRI and CT) as a result of  modification of distal tibiofibular relationship after a \nmild syndesmotic injury.", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 8 Acute Trauma to the Ankle  dislocation, with fractures involving the posterior facet, with associated massive swelling, or with  failure to regain \nsubtalar motion after a period of immobilizat ion [49]. \nCT with IV contrast is not ind icated in this scenario because soft-tissue abnormalities and fluid collections can be \nidentified on noncontr ast high -resolution CT studies. \nMRI Ankle  \nMRI of the ankle without IV contrast is most sensitive for evaluation of occult fractures with associated bone \nmarrow edema patterns, particularly in inversion injuries and persistent lateral ankle pain, as well  as presence and \nextent of soft -tissue injuries  [29]. Stress injuries of bone , including those of the weekend warrior , are best depicted \nby MRI  [50]. \nMRI is the reference standard for ligamentous injury and assessment of stability , which is particularly important in \nathletes, in whom determination of grade ( 1, 2, or 3) of syndesmotic ligament, anterior tibiofibular ligament , and \ndeltoid injuries is critical for treatment planning and return to sport assessment [51]. High -resolution evaluation of \nthe tendons and ligaments allows distinction between tendinopathy, sprain, and partial or complete tears.  \nLigament and tendon  injuries can occur without fracture on radiography . Gross terlinden et al [52] compared MR I \nand radiography and showed that 15% of ligamentous injuries ( including sprains , partial tears, and complete tears) \nat the syndesmosis in acute ankle injuries on MRI demonstrated no fracture on radiography. Presence o f bone bruise \nand adjacent soft -tissue edema have shown a higher association with acute ligamentous injuries ( anterior talofibular \nligament most common) and tendon abnormalities [53,54]  in patients with negative radiographs.  MRI can also help \nexclude Salter 1 fractures in the pediatric population [55]. \nRadiography Ankle  \nRepeat radiograph s are not typically the next study but may be of use to identify early callous formation at an occult \nfracture line or possible mineralization at a site of intramuscular hematoma if contusion occurred during trauma. \nRadiographs with better technique may assist in diagnosis of subtle injuries such as the lateral talar process avulsion , \nwhich  may erroneously be diagnosed as  a lateral ankle sprain  [37]. \nRadiography Ankle Stress Views  \nAlthough ankle stress views are not the typical next best study for this patient group, if  there is clinical evidence of \ninstability on physician maneuvers, ankle stress views may be of benefit for identification of occult avulsion injury \nat ligamentous attachments that may contribute t o widening of the joint spac e on radiographic stress views.  \nUS Ankle  \nUS is not typically  the next imaging study . US may be useful as a secondary evaluation modality for focuse d \nevaluation of underlying soft -tissue injuries  and ligaments, with the added benefit of dynamic imaging. This \nincludes f ocused high-resolution US of the peroneal tendons and th e superior peroneal retinaculum  [56], stress US \n(during anterior drawer) to assess joint laxity or chondral avulsion fra ctures associated with lateral ligament injury \nin children with negative radiographs [57,58] , and potential detection of superficial occult fractures at the base of \nthe fifth metatarsal, lateral malleolus,  and malleolus [41] . \nVariant  5: Adult or child 5 years of age or older.

Inability to ambulate for 4 steps in the emergency department.  \nVariant 2: Imaging is usually not appropriate for patients 5 years of age or older with a cute trauma to the ankle \nwhen the patient is able  to walk  and there are no exclusionary criteria present (eg, neurologically intact (includ ing \nno peripheral neuropathy )) and  the OAR  are negative: No point tenderness over the malleoli, talus, or calcaneus on \nphysical examination.  \nVariant 3: Ankle radiographs are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of patients 5 ye ars of age or older  with \nacute trauma to the ankle when exclusionary criteria are present (eg, neurologic disorder, neuropathy, or other) and \nthe patient does not meet requirements for evaluation by the OAR . \nVariant 4: MRI ankle without IV contrast or CT a nkle without IV contrast  are usually appropriate  for patients 5 \nyears of age or older with acute trauma to the ankle with persistent pain for more than 1 week but less than 3 weeks \nthat had negative initial radiographs and no exclusionary criteria are present.", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 9 Acute Trauma to the Ankle  fracture talus, also known as the  LIFT lesion) can occur after twisting injury to the ankle.  Initial radiographs should \nbe followed by CT  and MR I [60,61] . These lesions are treated successfully with combined open approach and \narthroscop y. \nFractures  \nCT is the first -line imaging  study  after radiographs to determine extent, displacement , comminution, intra -articular \nextension , associated injuries,  and potential classification of fractures [48] . This is particularly important in subtalar, \ncalcaneal,  and talar fractures because of  the complex anatomy and in high -impact polytrauma or complex \ncomminuted injuries in which multiplanar CT imaging is recommended to help direct the preoperative planning \nevaluation process [62]. \nMRI Ankle  \nOsteochondral lesions  \nMRI without  IV contrast is co nsidered the study of choice for assessment of cartilage abnormalities and bone \ncontusions related to acquired  osteochondral lesion,  particularly in patients with symptoms of persistent pain, \nstiffness, locking, clicking , and ankle swelling  [22,55-57,63] . Although radiographs and CT depict ossific fragments \nand fracture lines, cartilage abnormalities and bone contusions related to osteochondral lesion are best seen on MRI. \nSeventy percent  of ankle fractures and 50% of ankle sprains have been shown to result in some variation of cartilage \ninjury [57,58,61,64] . \nFractures  \nAlthough CT is more commonly used as the next step in fracture assessment in  known fractures, MRI can be useful \nas a follow-up imaging modality for assessment of associated bone marrow contusions, stress injuries,  or fractures \n[65]. MRI is especially important in fracture sites such as the talus,  which are at higher risk for osteonecrosis. MR I \nis highly accurate for associated soft -tissue abnormalities including tendon entrapment/dislocation and for \nligamentous inju ries [66]. \nRadiography Ankle Broden\u2019s View  \nThe Broden view is a supine  flexed knee view with 30 \u00b0 to 45\u00b0 internal rotation that  can be used  for specific improved \nevaluation of the lateral process fracture of the talus (commonly known as snowboarder\u2019s fracture). It may be of \nuse when further evaluation of the talar fracture is needed.  \nUS Ankle  \nOsteochondra l lesion  \nUS is not the next step in this clinical scenario.  \nFractures  \nUS has been shown to be useful for identification of lateral malleolar, medial malleolar , and fifth metatarsal \nfractures [41] but is not conside red a first -line assessment tool  or next imaging study  in this clinical scenario.  \nVariant 6 : Adult or child 5 years of age or older. Acute trauma to the ankle. Radiographs negative for osseous \ninjury and physical examination or radiographs demonstrate alignment abnormality  suggesting \nsyndesmotic/ligamentous injury or dislocation. Next study. \nLateral sprain is more common than medial strain , with the anterior talofibular ligament most commonly tor n. High \nsprain and fractures are more common in high -collision sport injuries [60], with higher incidence of ankle injuries \nduring winter months [67] and increased incidence in military recruits [68]. Inversion injuries of the ankle account \nfor 25% of musculoskeletal system injuries and 50% of all sports -related injuries [1].  \nBone Scan Ankle  \nBone scan is not routinely the next line of imaging in this clinical scenario.  \nCT Ankle  \nCT is useful for evaluation of dislocation and can be used to detect  syndesmotic injuries, although MRI is better for \nsoft-tissue evaluation. Nault et al [69]  validated CT scan measurement s that  can identify syndesmotic injuries seen \non MRI (retrosp ective study of MRI and CT) as a result of  modification of distal tibiofibular relationship after a \nmild syndesmotic injury.", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 8 Acute Trauma to the Ankle  dislocation, with fractures involving the posterior facet, with associated massive swelling, or with  failure to regain \nsubtalar motion after a period of immobilizat ion [49]. \nCT with IV contrast is not ind icated in this scenario because soft-tissue abnormalities and fluid collections can be \nidentified on noncontr ast high -resolution CT studies. \nMRI Ankle  \nMRI of the ankle without IV contrast is most sensitive for evaluation of occult fractures with associated bone \nmarrow edema patterns, particularly in inversion injuries and persistent lateral ankle pain, as well  as presence and \nextent of soft -tissue injuries  [29]. Stress injuries of bone , including those of the weekend warrior , are best depicted \nby MRI  [50]. \nMRI is the reference standard for ligamentous injury and assessment of stability , which is particularly important in \nathletes, in whom determination of grade ( 1, 2, or 3) of syndesmotic ligament, anterior tibiofibular ligament , and \ndeltoid injuries is critical for treatment planning and return to sport assessment [51]. High -resolution evaluation of \nthe tendons and ligaments allows distinction between tendinopathy, sprain, and partial or complete tears.  \nLigament and tendon  injuries can occur without fracture on radiography . Gross terlinden et al [52] compared MR I \nand radiography and showed that 15% of ligamentous injuries ( including sprains , partial tears, and complete tears) \nat the syndesmosis in acute ankle injuries on MRI demonstrated no fracture on radiography. Presence o f bone bruise \nand adjacent soft -tissue edema have shown a higher association with acute ligamentous injuries ( anterior talofibular \nligament most common) and tendon abnormalities [53,54]  in patients with negative radiographs.  MRI can also help \nexclude Salter 1 fractures in the pediatric population [55]. \nRadiography Ankle  \nRepeat radiograph s are not typically the next study but may be of use to identify early callous formation at an occult \nfracture line or possible mineralization at a site of intramuscular hematoma if contusion occurred during trauma. \nRadiographs with better technique may assist in diagnosis of subtle injuries such as the lateral talar process avulsion , \nwhich  may erroneously be diagnosed as  a lateral ankle sprain  [37]. \nRadiography Ankle Stress Views  \nAlthough ankle stress views are not the typical next best study for this patient group, if  there is clinical evidence of \ninstability on physician maneuvers, ankle stress views may be of benefit for identification of occult avulsion injury \nat ligamentous attachments that may contribute t o widening of the joint spac e on radiographic stress views.  \nUS Ankle  \nUS is not typically  the next imaging study . US may be useful as a secondary evaluation modality for focuse d \nevaluation of underlying soft -tissue injuries  and ligaments, with the added benefit of dynamic imaging. This \nincludes f ocused high-resolution US of the peroneal tendons and th e superior peroneal retinaculum  [56], stress US \n(during anterior drawer) to assess joint laxity or chondral avulsion fra ctures associated with lateral ligament injury \nin children with negative radiographs [57,58] , and potential detection of superficial occult fractures at the base of \nthe fifth metatarsal, lateral malleolus,  and malleolus [41] . \nVariant  5: Adult or child 5 years of age or older. Acute trauma to the ankle. No exclusionary criteria present. \nRadiographs demonstrate fracture or potential osteochondral injury. Next study.  \nBone Scan Ankle  \nOsteochondral lesions  \nBone scan is not the next imaging study in this clinical scenario.  \nFractures  \nBone scan is not the next imaging study in this clinical scenario. Bone scan may be used in rare setting in polytrauma \ncases for evaluation of multiple fractures.  \nCT Ankle  \nOsteoch ondral lesions  \nAlthough MRI is the reference standard, CT is also of utility to identify, locate, and quantify cortical and subcortical \ninvolvement or loss  as well as presence of intra -articular ossific bodies or associated fractures."], ["ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 7 Acute Trauma to the Foot  injuries  in midtarsal  (Chopart) sprains,  which  frequently  accompany  acute ankle  injuries  [52,53] . If radiographs  \nare negative,  MRI can be obtained in select  patients  with forefoot  pain because of its increased  sensitivity  for the \nearly  detection  of metatarsal  head  subchondral  fracture  [54]. \nLisfranc  Injury  \nMRI has been  advocated  as a sensitive diagnostic  test in evaluation  of Lisfranc ligamentous  complex  (especially  \nif the patient  is not able to bear weight),  and 3-D volumetric  acquisitions  have  proven superiority  over orthogonal  \nproton  density  fat-suppressed  imaging [33,38,41- 45]. There is a high correlation  between  MRI and intraoperative  \nfindings  for an unstable  Lisfranc injury  [44]. In the patient  with a suspected  Lisfranc injury  and normal  \nradiographs,  the literature  supports  further advanced  imaging  by MRI  and CT [21,33,43,46] . \nTurf Toe and Plantar  Plate Injuries \nMRI is the preferred  imaging method for evaluating  suspected  \u201cturf  toe\u201d and lesser  metatarsal  plantar  plate  injury  \nby directly  evaluating  the soft-tissue structures of the capsuloligamentous  complex  as well as assessing  chondral  \nand osteochondral  lesions [29,55,56] . \nAcute  Tendinous  Rupture  \nMRI tends  to be used as a screening  tool when  one is not certain  of the specific tendon injury  or if concomitant  \nosseous injury  is suspected.  Both  MRI and US have  been  shown  to be sensitive  for the diagnosis  of acute tendon  \nrupture  or dislocation  in the foot [39]. In a surgically  confirmed  study,  MRI was shown  to have  83% sensitivity  \nfor diagnosing tendon and ligament  traumatic  injuries  about  the foot and ankle  [37]. \nUS Foot  \nThe importance  of focused  US examinations  is emphasized  in the literature  [57,58] . Protocol -based  US evaluation  \nidentified  97.4%  of symptomatic abnormalities  in the distal  extremities  (including the foot),  with additional  \naccuracy  obtained  with focused  examination  [57]. \nLisfranc  Injury  \nAlthough  the literature  evidence is limited, US may hold promise  as an alternative method to accurately  evaluate \nfor a significant  Lisfranc injury  providing direct  and indirect  assessment  of the Lisfranc ligamentous  complex  as \nwell as dynamic  evaluation  with weightbearing  as demonstrated  in a series of 10 patients  [59].  Dorsal  component  \nof Lisfranc ligament  is amenable to direct  US evaluation  [59,60] , although this structure may not be critical  for \nstability  for the Lisfranc joint [20,32] . The physiologic  deformation of the dorsal  Lisfranc ligament  resulting  from  \nfunctional  loading emphasized  the need  for normative  US data as well as proper  positioning  when  bilateral  \nevaluation  is performed  [61,62] . \nTurf Toe and Plantar  Plate Injuries \nUS in the sagittal  plane  best visualizes  the plantar  plate  between  the flexor  tendon and hyaline  cartilage of the \nmetatarsal  head  [63]. US has shown  a 96% sensitivity  compared  with 87% sensitivity  for MRI  for the detection  of \nlesser  toe plantar  plate  tears;  however , both modalities  have  poor specificity  [64].  \nAcute  Tendinous  Rupture  \nBoth  MRI and US have  been  shown  to be sensitive for the diagnosis  of acute tendon  rupture  or dislocation  in the \nfoot [39]. US has also been  reported  to have  a high sensitivity  for peroneal  tendon  tears [65].", "ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 6 Acute Trauma to the Foot  Radiograph y Foot  \nMetatarsal -Phalangeal  Joint Injury  \nThe best initial imaging study  for evaluating  hallux  plantar  plate  disruption  after metatarsal -phalangeal  (MTP)  \njoint injury  is weightbearing  AP, lateral,  and sesamoid  axial  views,  with addition  of comparison  radiographs  of \nthe contralateral  foot [29].  Radiographs  may also indirectly  evaluate lesser  metatarsophalangeal  plantar  plate  \ninjury  [30]. The combination  of a positive  drawer  test coupled with transverse deviation  of the third  MTP  joint on \nradiographs  can be used to diagnose  high-grade  plantar  plate  tear of the second  MTP joint [31]. \nA forced  dorsiflexion lateral  view of the hallux  MTP  joint is recommended  if there is clinical  suspicion  of plantar  \nplate  injury  of the first MTP joint [29]. \nRadiography Foot  with  Weightbearing  \nThe best initial imaging study  for evaluating  hallux  plantar  plate  disruption after MTP joint injury  is \nweightbearing  AP, lateral,  and sesamoid  axial  views  with addition  of comparison radiographs  of the contralateral  \nfoot [29,32] . \nCT Foot  \nStudies  report  moderate to poor sensitivity  (25%\u201333%)  of radiographs  in detection  of midfoot  fractures [21] in \nLevel  1 trauma  patients.  A study of 49 patients  with acute hyperflexion injuries  to the foot concluded that \nconventional  radiographs  including  weightbearing  images are not sufficient  for routine  diagnostic  workup and CT \nshould serve as the primary  imaging  technique  for such patients  [33]. \nMRI Foot  \nMRI is the most  sensitive modality  for the detection  of occult  fracture  and acute bone  stress changes [34,35] . MRI  \nis not routinely  used as the first imaging study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the foot in setting  of suspected  \nMTP joint injury  or occult  fracture.  Both  MRI and US are used in evaluating  soft-tissue injuries  of the foot in the \nsetting  of acute trauma,  especially  when  radiographs  are noncontributory.  Both  modalities  have  a similar  \nsensitivity  for acute soft-tissue  trauma  about  the ankle  and foot such as ligamentous  and tendinous  disruption [36-\n38]. \nUS Foot  \nUS is not routinely  used as the first imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the foot in the setting  of \nsuspected  MTP joint injury  or occult  fracture.  US has been  shown  to be sensitive for the diagnosis  of acute tendon  \nrupture  or tendon dislocation  in the foot [36,39,40] . \nFluoroscopy  Foot  \nIn addition  to routine  radiographs , fluoroscopy  has been  suggested  in assessment  of a hallux  MTP joint injury  \nwith direct  fluoroscopic  evaluation  of sesamoid  tracking  distally  with great  toe extension  at the MTP joint on \nforced  dorsiflexion lateral  view or fluoroscopy  [29]. \nVariant  5: Adult  or child older  than  5 years of age. Acute trauma  to the foot.  Suspect  Lisfranc injury, \ntendon injury, or occult  fracture or dislocation. Radiographs  are normal  or equivocal. Next  imaging  study. \nCT Foot  \nLisfranc  Injury  \nCT has been  advocated  as the primary  imaging  technique  in acute hyperflexion  injury  and high-energy  \npolytrauma  (especially  if the patient is not able to bear weight)  [33,38,41- 45].", "Radiography Foot  with  Weightbearing  \nIf there are clinical  signs  of a Lisfranc  injury , obtaining  weight bearing  radiographs  is recommended  when  \npossible  because nonweightbearing  radiographs  are not reliable  for detection  of subtle  injuries.  Weightbearing  \nviews have  been  shown  to increase the abnormal  alignment  at the Lisfranc joint, thus making it easier  to identify  a \nLisfranc injury  [16,19] . The inclusion  of both feet on AP radiographs  can help in the detection  of subtle  \nmalalignment  when  compared  with the uninjured side [20]. \nCT Foot  \nCT is commonly used in evaluating  the true extent  of osseous injury  in complex fractures and at times  is used as \nthe initial imaging  study  in polytrauma  patients  and in complex  regions  such as the midfoot  [21,22] . CT is not \nroutinely  used as the first imaging study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the foot with positive  Ottawa rules  \nwhen  exclusionary  criteria  do not apply.  \nMRI Foot \nMRI is not routinely used as the first imaging study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the foot with positive  \nOttawa rules ."], ["ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 6 Chronic Knee Pain  of age having an asymptomatic meniscal tear , and the likelihood of a meniscal tear being present in either a \npainful or asymptomatic knee not significantly different in patients 45 to 55 years of age [20,21]. \nBone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the \nsubchondral bone.  New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or \npatients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee \npain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the \norigin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. \nSubchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed \nspontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to \nelderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs \noften initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, \nand progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is \nsuspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria\n\u00ae \ntopic on \u201c Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae \u201d [28]. \nSome patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using \nquantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs \nexhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ]. \nPatellofemoral car tilage loss is also associated with chronic knee pain , with active knee pain correlated with \nBMLs [30,31]. Similar to CT, MRI can calculate various anatomic measurements associated with patellofemoral \nsubluxation/dislocation and lateral patellofemoral friction syndrome [32-34]. Bone marrow edema in the classic \nlocation for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also \ndifferentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise \ntherapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. \nOther etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat \npad impingement syndromes, Hoffa\u2019s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome, adhesive \ncapsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes , \nand osteonecrosis [15, 19,36-45].  \nMRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a \njoint effusion. However, contrast -enhanced images ma y be more accurate in diagnosing other causes of chronic \nknee pain , such as Hoffa\u2019s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome, and adhesive \ncapsulitis [15].  In particular, enh ancing synovitis thicker than 2 mm in Hoffa\u2019s fat is correlated with peripatellar \npain [46]. Contrast -enhanced MRI is also useful in quantifying the degree of synovitis and in evaluating \nconditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis [ 17,42,47,48].  \nMR Arthrography  Knee  \nMR arthrography performed with an intra -articular injection of dilute gadolinium solution is typically not \nindicated as a second exam ination  but rather reserved for patients with known prior meniscal surgery, chondral \nand osteochondral lesions , and suspected loose bodies  [10].", "ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 12 Acute  Trauma  to the Knee  Variant  7: Adult  or child 5 years of age or older . Significant  trauma  to the knee  (eg, motor  vehicle  accident,  \nknee  dislocation). Initial imaging.  \nArteriography  Lower Extremity  \nVascular  injury  may be found in about  30% of patients  following  posterior  knee  dislocation  [56]. Injuries  of the \npopliteal artery  require  prompt  surgical  intervention to help limb preservation . Associated  peroneal  and tibial nerve  \ninjuries  may cause significant  morbidity and require  an understanding of their pathophysiologic  implications  to \nmaximize  limb functionality  [57]. Angiography  has been  the reference standard  in the evaluation  of vascular  injuries  \nassociated  with knee  dislocations  [58]. However,  this is an invasive  procedure  with associated  risk, and with the \nexcellent  performance of CTA and MRA, it is usually  performed  in selected  cases  [58]. \nCT Knee  \nCT is not routinely  used as the initial imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the knee.  CT is superior  \nto knee  radiographs  in detection  and classification  of fractures [12]; however,  without  IV contrast , CT cannot  detect  \nvascular  injuries. \nCTA Lower Extremity  \nWith  suspected  vascular  injuries  in the setting  of knee  dislocation, CTA  is frequently  used because it is less invasive  \nand has a similar ly high accuracy  as conventional  angiography [58-60]. \nMR Arthrography  Knee  \nIn patients  with significant  acute knee  trauma  with suspected  or possible  dislocation , MR arthrography  of the knee \nis not routinely used as the initial imaging  study.  \nMRA Knee  \nMRI is an accurate method used in the evaluation  of soft-tissue,  osseous,  and neural  injuries  after knee  dislocation  \n[61]. MRA  may be performed  simultaneously  with MRI  for evaluation  of internal  derangement  and vascular  injuries  \nwith less morbidity  compared  with conventional  angiography  [62]. Potter  et al [61] reported  their experience with \npopliteal fossa MRA  with encouraging  results and complete agreement  between  the MRA  and conventional  \nangiography in patients  who had both studies.  Similarly, in a study  by Tocci  et al [62], MRA  has been  shown  to be \nas accurate and useful  as conventional  angiography in the evaluation  of popliteal  artery  injuries  of patients  with \nknee  dislocations.  \nMRI Knee  \nWith  its superb  contrast  resolution  and multiplanar  imaging capability , MRI is proven to be a highly  accurate  \nimaging modality  in the evaluation  of bone  marrow  contusions  and occult  fractures [27-29] as well as meniscal  \n[21,26]  and ligamentous  injuries  [21,31,32] .

In a study \nby Mustonen  et al [12],  CT showed  100%  and radiographs  83% sensitivity  in detection  of tibial plateau fractures , \nand CT was superior  in further  characterization  of fracture  severity . \nIn the setting  of acute knee  trauma,  Mui et al [13] reported  80% sensitivity  and 98% specificity  of the CT \nexamination  in detecting  bony  avulsion  fractures and a high negative  predictive  value  for excluding  ligamentous  \ninjuries , but MRI remained  necessary  for the preoperative  detection  of meniscal  injury . \nPeltola  et al [14] compared  dual-energy  CT examinations  with MRI  studies as a reference standard  in 18 patients  \nwith acute knee  trauma  and reported  dual-energy  CT had 79% sensitivity  and 100%  specificity  in detecting  anterior  \ncruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures  [14]. \nIn a study  by Heffernan  et al [15], 64-channel  multidetector  CT showed  87.5% to 100%  sensitivity  and 100%  \nspecificity  for detection  of the ACL  tears.  As on MRI,  secondary  signs,  such as buckling  of the posterior  cruciate \nligament , were also useful  in their diagnosis.  In this study , multidetector  CT showed a low sensitivity  for other  soft-\ntissue injuries  at the knee;  however,  its high specificity  indicated  that apparent  posterior  cruciate  ligament , meniscal,  \nand collateral  ligament  tears can reliably  be treated  as true-positive  findings  [15]. \nThe dual-energy  CT virtual  noncalcium  technique  can subtract  calcium  from  cancellous bone,  allowing  detection  \n[16-18] and possibly grading of the post-traumatic  bone  marrow  contusions  [18]. \nHowever,  MRI is superior  to CT in detection  of bone  marrow  abnormalities  and meniscal  and ligamentous  injuries  \nand may be subsequently  performed  as clinically  indicated. \nMR Arth rography  Knee  \nWith  negative radiographs,  MR arthrography  is not routinely  used as the next imaging study  for the evaluation  of \nsuspected  occult  knee  fractures or internal  derangement . \nMRA Knee  \nWith  negative radiographs,  MRA  is not routinely  used as the next imaging study  for the evaluation  of suspected  \noccult  knee  fractures or internal  derangement . \nMRI Knee  \nMRI has many  distinct advantages for the evaluation  of the injured  knee  in the setting  of negative  radiographs.  \nThe majority  of patients  (93.5%)  who present  with acute  knee  injuries  in the emergency  department  sustained  soft-\ntissue injuries  rather  than osseous injuries  [19].

MRI may also \ndifferentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise \ntherapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. \nOther etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat \npad impingement syndromes, Hoffa\u2019s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome, adhesive \ncapsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes , \nand osteonecrosis [15, 19,36-45].  \nMRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a \njoint effusion. However, contrast -enhanced images ma y be more accurate in diagnosing other causes of chronic \nknee pain , such as Hoffa\u2019s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome, and adhesive \ncapsulitis [15].  In particular, enh ancing synovitis thicker than 2 mm in Hoffa\u2019s fat is correlated with peripatellar \npain [46]. Contrast -enhanced MRI is also useful in quantifying the degree of synovitis and in evaluating \nconditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis [ 17,42,47,48].  \nMR Arthrography  Knee  \nMR arthrography performed with an intra -articular injection of dilute gadolinium solution is typically not \nindicated as a second exam ination  but rather reserved for patients with known prior meniscal surgery, chondral \nand osteochondral lesions , and suspected loose bodies  [10].", "Next \nimaging procedure . \nWhen associated with acute injury, recommendations are covered in the  ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae topic on \n\u201cAcute Trauma to the Knee\u201d  [4].", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 4 Chronic Knee Pain  CHRONIC  KNEE PAIN\nExpert Panel on Musculoskel etal Imaging: Michael G.

Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and \nit can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain \nwith the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. \nTypically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain \npersists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  \nimaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated \nthat approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the \nprior year) radiographs [2 ]. \nThis document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  \u22655 years of age.  The \nvariants discussed include: (1) initial exam ination ; (2) initial radiograph is normal or demonstrates a joint \neffusion; (3) initial radiogr aph demonstrates osteochondritis dissecans (OCD), loose bodies or history of cartilage,  \nor meniscal repair; (4) initial radiograph demonstrates osteoarthritis or chondrocalcinosis; and (5)  initial \nradiograph demonstrates signs of prior (chronic) knee injur y (ie, Segond fract ure, tibial spine avulsion, etc ).  \nTo evaluat e knee pain associated with other conditions, please refer to the following ACR Appropriateness \nCriteria\u00ae topic on:  \u201cOsteonecrosi s of the Hip \u201d [3] for osteonecrosis,  \u201cAcute Trauma to the Knee \u201d for acute knee \ninjuries  [4], \u201cImaging After Total Knee Arthroplasty \u201d for patients with total knee arthroplasty  [5], \u201cSoft-Tissue \nMasses \u201d for a patient with a suspected soft -tissue mass [6], \u201cPrimary Bone Tumors \u201d for a patient with a suspected \nor known bone tumor [ 7], and \u201c Chronic Extremity Joint Pain -Suspected Inflammatory Arthritis \u201d for patient with \nsuspected arthritis  or synovitis [ 8]. \nSpecial Imaging  Considerations  \nKnee radiographs  should include at least one frontal projection of one or both knees (anteroposterior, Rosenberg, \nor tunnel), a tangential patellar view , and a lateral view of the affected knee [2,9]. Standing radiographs more \naccurately reflect medial and lateral compartment cartilage loss than supine radiographs with the posteromedial and posterolateral joint compartments  more accurately assessed using a weight -bearing flexion posteroanterior \nradiograph [9,10]. \nDiscussion of Pro cedures by Variant  \nVariant 1:  Adult or child greater than or equal to 5  year s of age . Chronic knee pain. Initial imaging.  \nRadiography Knee \nRadiographs  should be the initial imaging study for chronic knee pain. In elderly patients, the most common \nsource of  chronic knee pain is osteoarthritis."], ["In randomized studies of patients  with knee  injuries  [23,24] , \nMRI findings  shortened  the diagnostic  completion  workup,  reduced  the number  of additional  diagnostic  procedures,  \nand improve d quality  of life in the first 6 weeks,  potentially  reduc ing productivity loss. \nA retrospective study  by Cecava et al [25] showed  that knee  radiography  is a highly specific screening  test for \ninternal  derangement  in patients  <40 years old with acute knee injury.  In this patient population,  knee  effusion  >10 \nmm on lateral  radiograph  should prompt  consideration  for the knee  MRI examination , which  can potentially  \ndecrease delayed  diagnosis,  improve  patient  outcomes,  and decrease  disability  [25].  \nMagee et al [26] reported  96% sensitivity  and 97% specificity  of 3T MRI in the detection  of meniscal  tears in \ncorrelation  with arthroscopy . However,  a study  by Van Dyck  et al [21] showed  similar  high sensitivities  and \nspeci ficities  of routine  3T and 1.5T MRI examinations  in the evaluation  of meniscal  and ACL  tears with \narthroscopic  correlation.  Routine  3T MRI  protocol  did not significantly  improve  accuracy  for evaluating  the knee  \nmenisci  and ACL  compared  with a similar  1.5T MRI  protocol.  \nMRI can diagnose  the pattern s and severity  of bone  marrow  contusions  that frequently  have  an association  with the \nspecific mechanisms of injury  and can predict  associated  soft-tissue injuries  [27,28] . In a study by Song  et al [28],", "ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 10 Acute  Trauma  to the Knee  US study  by Dai et al including  551 patients  from  7 prospective  studies revealed  pooled sensitivity  of 88% and \nspecificity  of 90% in diagnosis  of meniscal  injuries  [46]. \nAnother  meta -analysis of 4 US studies including  246 patients  revealed  pooled sensitivity  of 90% and specificity  of \n97% in the diagnosis  of ACL  injuries  [47]. An US study  in correlation  with MRI  and pivot  shift testing  suggested  \na potential utility  of US examination  in diagnosis  of the anterolateral  ligament injury  [48]. Wang  et al [49] found  \n2-D US a potentially  useful  tool in diagnosis  of posterior  cruciate ligament  injuries  with a posterior  cruciate ligament  \nthickness \u22656.5 mm as a recommended  diagnostic  criterion.  \nVariant  4: Skeletally  immature  child.

CT may diagnose  or predict  \nligamentous  injuries  [14,15,50,51]  and predict  menisc al [15,50,51]  injuries. However,  MRI is superior  to CT in \nevaluation  of bone  marrow  lesions [27-29], meniscal  [21,26]  and ligamentous  [21,31-34]  injuries , and may be \nsubsequently  performed  as clinically  indicated.  \nMR Arth rography  Knee  \nWith  negative radiographs,  MR arthrography  is not routinely  used as the next imaging study  for the evaluation  of \nsuspected  occult  knee  fractures or internal  derangement . \nMRA Knee  \nWith  negative radiographs,  MRA  is not routinely  used as the next imaging study  for the evaluation  of suspected  \noccult  knee  fractures or internal  derangement.  \nMRI Knee  \nMRI should  be the next imaging modality  to evaluate for the presence of radiographically  occult  fractures  and/or  \ninternal  derangements of the acutely  injured knee.  With  its superb  contrast  resolution  and multiplanar  imaging  \ncapability , MRI  is proven to be a highly accurate imaging modality  in the evaluation  of bone  marrow  contusions  \nand occult  fractures [27-29] as well as meniscal  [21,26]  and ligamentous  injuries  [21,31-34] . \nBone  Scan  with  SPECT  or SPECT/CT  Knee  \nTc-99m  bone  scan with SPECT/CT  would not be the next best imaging study  to evaluate for radiographically  occult  \nfractures and/or  internal  derangement.  \nEven-Sapir et al [37] showed  promising results of a SPECT study  in diagnosis  of the ACL  and meniscal  tears and \nthe associated  bone  contusions  in patients with acute knee trauma  with arthroscopic  and MRI correlation . However,  \na more  recent  SPECT study  with arthroscopic  correlation  by Wertman  et al [39] showed  a lower  sensitivity,  \nspecificity , and accuracy  than MRI in evaluating  meniscal  injuries . \nUS Knee  \nUS would not be the next best imaging study  to evaluate for radiographically occult  fractures and/or  internal  \nderangement  of the acutely  injured  knee .

Chronic ankle  pain can be caused by a variety \nof osseous or soft -tissue abnormalities, either alone or in combination. For assessing chronic ankle pain, there are \nmultiple imaging options, including radiography, stress radiography,  computed tomography (CT)  radionuclide \nbone scanning, ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and various injection procedures. Injection \nproce dures include arthrography, CT arthrography, MR arthrography, and diagnostic injection with anesthetic \nagents. Although there are numerous causes for chronic ankle pain, common etiologies include osteoarthritis, \nosteochondral injury, tendon abnormalities, ligament abnormalities and instability, and impingement.  \nOverview of Imaging Modalities  \nRadiography Radiographs can provide information about the osseous and soft -tissue structures about the ankle. Routine \nradiographs of the ankle typically include anteroposterior, lateral, and mortise views, the latter obtained by internally rotating the foot 15 to 20 degrees.  Stress radiographs can be used to assess ankle instability  [1,2]; \nhowever , some have questioned their accuracy [3 ,4]. \nCT \nCT is not routinely used as a first -line imaging tool in chronic ankle pain, but it is more sensitive than \nradiographs, particularly for osseous abnormalities  [5]. CT arthrography may be more accurate than MR \narthrography for the identification of osteochondral abnormalities  [6]. \nBone Scan  \nConventional planar bone scintigraphy can assess osseous pathology.  More recently, single -photon emission \ncomputed tomogr aphy (SPECT)  combined with CT has been shown to provide additional information compared \nwith clinical diagnosis and conventional bone scintigraphy for the evaluation of impingement syndromes and soft -\ntissue pathology [7]. In addition, SPECT/CT abnormalities have been shown to significantly correlate with pain  in \nosteochondral lesions  [8]. \nUS \nUS can be used to evaluate for soft -tissue abnormalities, including tendon and ligament tears. In inflammatory \narthritis, it can help in the assessment of disease activity and severity as well as detect subclinical pathology in \nearly disease or after treatment [9 ]. US is ideal for dynamic assessment of peroneal tendon instability [10] and can \nbe used to guide interventions  [11]. Compared with some other modalities, US is less prone to artifacts, such as \nsusceptibility, motion, magic angle , and streak artifact, but dynamic assessment may be limited in cases of pain.  \nMRI  \nMRI is the imaging test that globally evaluates all anatomic structures, including ligaments, tendons, cartilage, \nand bone  [12,13]. Most studies have shown that MRI is highly accurate for evaluation of ligament, tendon,  and \n \naPrincipal Author and Panel Chair,  VA San Diego Healthcare System, San Diego, California . bResearch Author, University of California San Diego Medical \nCenter, San Diego, California.  cUniversity of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.  dRush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois; \nAmerican College of Physicians.  ePenn State Milton S.

Overall \nsensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs \nin the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral \nand oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar \ncoalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs \non the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have \nbeen found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable \nmethods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  \nRadiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review \nby Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for \nradiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.  \nRadiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  \nusually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, \nosteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite \nversus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess \nwith radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton\u2019s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other \ncauses of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg\u2019s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals \nor soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . \nThough radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in \npatients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The \ncombination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a \nspecificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15]. \nUS Foot  \nUltrasound (US) is usually not indicate d as the first imaging  study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain, but may \nbe performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of pathologic conditions of the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, \nand other conditions such as tarsal tunnel syndrome, Morton\u2019s  neuroma , plantar plate tears,  and intermetatarsal \nbursitis. \nVariant 2: Persistent posttraumatic foot pain.

Grossterlinden et al  [52] compared MRI and \nradiography and showed that 15% of ligamentous injuries (including sprains, partial tears, and complete tears) at \nthe syndesmosis in acute ankle injuries on M RI demonstra ted no fracture on radiography.  \nRare pantalar dislocations without associated talar or other fracture can be assessed on CT or MRI and have high \nrates of osteonecrosis, osteoarthritis, and infection  [71]. \nRadiography Ankle Stress Views  \nStress radiograph s may be useful in assessing syndesmotic instability, particularly in supination external rotation \nankle injuries according to the Lauge -Hansen classification. Lee et al [72]  noted that tibiotalar tilt angle and anterior \ntibiofibular space measurements were affected when the anterior tibiofibular and posterior talofibular ligaments \nwere injured (confirmed on MRI) in 299 patients . Lateral stress testing with widening of the tibiofibular clear space \nhas been shown to be  an indicator of syndesmotic injury , with the traditional external rotation stress test shown to \nbe a poor indicator when t he deltoid ligament is injured [73] . \nRadiography Leg \nMaisonneuve fracture (syndesmotic injury of the ankle in combination with a proximal fibular fracture) may be \noverlooked as a result of  lack of pain at the fibula. Careful palpation of the proximal fibula should be performed \nwith radiographic evaluation of the entire tibia and fibular if focal tenderness is present [74] . \nUS Ankle  \nUS is not typically the next line of evaluation  of syndesmotic injuries.

Radiographs normal or nonspecific. Suspect carpal tunnel syndrome.  Next \nstudy. \nUS Wrist \nSeveral meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the \ncarpal  tunnel  inlet) is highly accurate for identifying carpal  tunnel syndrome  diagnosed clinically or with the \ncombination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US \nvaries depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the \nmeasurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary \nexamination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel \nsyndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal \ntunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, \nclinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of \ncarpal tunnel syndrome. US may be appropriate in cases where this initial evaluation is equivocal.  \nMRI Wrist  \nHistorically, carpal tunnel syndrome has been diagnosed based on clinical signs and sympt oms and confirmed by \nthe results of electrodiagnostic studies [67].

The MRI findings that have been reported in wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome \u2014\nincluding nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing\u2014may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value \nin patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68]. In rare cases of secondary carpal tunnel syndrome, MRI may identify \na mass lesion compressing the median nerve. There is some evidence that the length of T2 hyperintensity in the \nmedian nerve can help prognosticate the success of surgery [69] and that the shape and signal of the nerve predict \nclinical response to a steroid injection in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome [70 ].

Kransdorf, MD.n \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nChronic foot pain is a frequent clinical complaint with approximately 14% to 42% of adults in the United States \nreporting foot problems, often with significant impact on mobility, difficulty performing daily activities , and \nincreased risk of falling, particularly in older individuals [1,2] . Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a \nsignificant improvement in health-related quality of life with effective treatment of foot pain [3] . Estimating the \nprevalence of chron ic foot pain is challenging, because there is no consensus regarding the definition of chronic \npain in the literature. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines chronic pain as any pain persisting \npast the normal healing time, suggesting 3 months in case of chronic pain of benign causes.  \nWomen are more commonly affected , and forefoot conditions are more frequent. Persistent pain for more than 6  \nyears has been reported in 51% of women between 70 to 75 years of age [4]. Because of  the wide range of causes \nof chronic foot pain, assessment of these patients with imaging studies in addition to a dedicated clinical \nexamination is often needed [1] . \nThe guidelines of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons divide heel pain into plantar heel pain,  usually \nrelated to pathology of the plantar fascia, and posterior heel pain,  usually related to pathology of  the Achilles tendon, \nand treatment options vary from nonoperative treatments to surgical procedures [5] . \nChronic foot pain in children, symptoms related to soft -tissue or bone neoplasms and pain related to infectious \nconditions, inflammatory arthropathies, or other systemic diseases are beyond the scope of this document. \nEvaluation of patients with neuropathic foot or Charcot arthropathy is addressed in the ACR Appropriateness \nCriteria\u00ae topic on \u201c Suspected Osteomyelitis of the Foot in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus \u201d [6]. Posttraumatic \nentities affecting the ankle,  including instability, arthrosis, osteochondral defects, osteonecrosis, and tendinop athies,  \nare discussed in  ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae topic on \u201cChronic Ankle Pain \u201d [7]. Infectious and inflammatory \narthropathies are discussed in ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae topic s on \u201cSuspected Osteomyelitis, Septic Arthritis, \nor Soft Tissue Infection (Excluding Spine and Diabetic Foot) \u201d [8] and \u201c Chronic Extremity Joint Pain \u2013Suspected \nInflammatory Arthritis \u201d [9]. Acute traumatic in juries of the foot including Lisfranc injuries are discussed in  ACR \nAppropriateness Criteria\u00ae topic on \u201cAcute Trauma to the Foot \u201d [10]. \nInitial Imaging Definition \nImaging at the beginning of the care episode for the medical condition defined by the variant. More than one \nprocedure can be considered usually appropriate in the initial imaging evaluation when  \n\u2022 There are procedures that are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedu re will be ordered to \nprovide the clinical information to effectively manage the patient\u2019s care)  \nOR \n\u2022 There are complementary procedures (ie, more than one procedure is ordered as a set or \nsimultaneously in which  each procedure provides unique clinical information to effectively manage \nthe patient\u2019s care)."], ["ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 10 Chronic Wrist Pain  importantly, though, the finding of enhancing bone marrow \u201cedema\u201d (osteitis) on MRI studies in patients with \nearly RA is proving to be the best single predictor of future disease progression and functional dete rioration, even \ncompared to serologies and clinical measures [27, 28,32-34].  \nUS Wrist  \nThe diagnosis of a specific inflammatory arthritis is typically established based on clinical and laboratory \nanalysis. Advanced imaging is usually performed to determine disease activity, guide management decisions, and prognosticate outcomes. In patients with RA, US  of the wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints can  show \ninflammation  as active synovitis. Identifying active synovitis with power Doppler assessment is a useful adjunct \nin making an early diagnosis of RA when a pati ent with early arthritis does not meet the 2010 criteria established \nby the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism [20]. The presence of \nsynovitis predicts progression of erosions [31 ] and erosions themselves [35]. US can also depict small bone \nerosions with high spatial resolution; h owever, US is less sensitive to erosions that occur on the radial or ulnar \nsides of the inner carpal bones because direct scanning of these regions is blocked, unlike the dorsal and volar \nbone surfaces. Furthermore, unlike MRI, US cannot show changes within the bone marrow, which are  the \nstrongest prognosticator s for disease progression in RA [27, 28,32-34].  In patients with established inflammatory \narthritis who are undergoing therapy, judging progression or reduction of synovitis may be more difficult with \nsequential US compared to sequential MRI.  \nMR Arthrography  Wrist  \nMR arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected inflammatory \narthritides. \nCT Wrist  \nWhile CT is more sensitive than radiographs for erosions, CT is not routinely used for the diagnosis and \nmanagement of patients with suspected inflammatory arthritides . \nCT Arthrography  Wrist  \nCT arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected inflammatory \narthritides. \nBone Scan  Wrist  \nBone scan does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients  with suspected inflammatory \narthritides. \nArthrography  Wrist  \nRadiographic arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected \ninflammatory arthritides. \nVariant 4: Chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or show nonspecific ar thritis. Exclude infection. Next \nstudy. \nAspiration  Wrist  \nNo literature directly addresses the appropriateness of imaging studies beyond radiographs in patients with \nsuspected infection in the wrist. However, generalizing from experience with septic arthrit is in other joints, joint \naspiration should not be delayed in order to obtain advanced imaging studies. In cases of suspected septic arthritis, \npercutaneous aspiration of the wrist is indicated, even when radiographs appear normal. Aspirates should be \nanalyzed by cell count, gram stain, and appropriate cultures. Microscopic crystal analysis should also be obtained \nif there is a possibility of gout, acute pseudogout, or hydroxyapatite deposition disease. Aspiration can be \nperformed without imaging guidance i f the joint is distended, but either fluoroscopy or US  may be useful if a \nspecific compartment is to be targeted.  \nMRI Wrist  \nThere may be a role for MRI with IV contrast enhancement in the staging of infections (for example, to delineate the location and extent of soft-tissue abscesses)  after aspiration has been performed.  Especially in chronic cases, \nMRI with IV contrast may be useful to identify a fluid collection or joint effusion to target  for aspiration.  \nHowever, MRI is usually not appropriate as the next study after radiographs for suspected wrist infections.  \nMR Arthrography  Wrist  \nMR arthrography is not routinely used to evaluate suspected wrist infection.", "ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 8 Chronic  Extremity  Joint  Pain radiographic  progression [10-12].  The evidence is inconclusive  as to whether  MRI or US should be considered  the \npreferred  method for evaluation  of RA [18]. \nUS has been  used to evaluate for osseous abnormalities  in the setting  of chronic  inflammatory  arthritis. Compared  \nwith radiography,  US has been  shown  to demonstrate a 6.5-fold  increase in the number  of detected  erosions of the \nmetacarpophalangeal  joints  [12], but it is less accurate when  compared  with CT [11]. The f alse-positive  rate for US \nin detection  of metacarpophalangeal  joint erosions  has been  reported  as high as 29% [29]. Regardless,  large  erosions  \nidentified  with US at the second  and third  metacarpophalangeal  joints, the distal  ulna,  and the fifth \nmetatarsophalangeal  joint are highly specific for and predictive  of RA [30]. US may also show  imaging  findings  \nassociated  with enthesitis  [25], with findings  of enthesitis  on power  Doppler  imaging  having  an accuracy  of 85.6% \nin distinguishing  peripheral  spondyloarthritis  versus nonspondyloarthropathy [31]. Studies  have  also found US to \nbe helpful  in differentiating  RA and psoriatic  arthritis  [32,33] ; for example,  enthesitis  is a finding often  seen in \nspondyloarthritis  but not seen in RA. Increased  distance between  the nail and distal  phalanx in patients  with psoriatic  \narthritis  and cutaneous  psoriasis is reported  to have  an 80% sensitivity  and a 71% specificity  [34]. \nUS is also useful  in the evaluation  for synovitis  and tenosynovitis,  aided  by the detection  of hyperemia via color  or \nDoppler  signal  [23]. Power  Doppler  US is more  accurate for the diagnosis  of synovitis  and has a higher  correlation  \nwith disease activity  compared  with grayscale US [35,36] . Synovitis  on power  Doppler  US and grayscale US are \nboth associated  with the development  of radiographic  erosions  in patients  with RA compared  with grayscale US \n[37,38] . Newer  techniques  for detecting  microvascularization  associated  with joint inflammation  like multimodal  \nphotoacoustic/ US and ultra-microangiography have  shown  promise  as indicators  of disease activity  [39,40] . \nUS also provides  prognostic  information  (such  as detecting  synovitis)  that is linked to disease progression [13], \nalthough  mild synovial  hypertrophy as an isolated  finding  is not specific and has limited  relevance [41]. In the \nevaluation  of the finger  joints  with US, dorsal  evaluation  is recommended  over palmar  [42].

It has been \nshown that MRI has a significant effect in the diagnostic and therapeutic decisions made by orthopedic surgeons \nthanks to an increase in their confidence levels and change in treatment [34] . MRI is believed to be a sensitive and \nreliable method to evaluate patients with metatarsalgia and Morton\u2019s  neuroma  with a sensitivity of 87%, specificity \nof 100%, accuracy of 89%, PPV of 100% , and NPV of 60% in surgically treated patients [35] . In a meta- analysis,  \nMRI had  a pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio , and negative likelihood ratio of 93%, 68%, 1.89,  \nand 0.19, respectively [36]. Increased fluid within the intermetatarsal bursa, which suggest s bursitis, is well \ndemonstrated on MRI [37] . Although the use of gadolinium does not seem essential to detect Morton\u2019s  neuroma s \n[38], it may facilitate its detection  because of  the improved soft -tissue contrast [32,39] . \nMRI is widely accepted as the imaging study  of choice for diagnosis of plantar plate tears. In a prospective study, \nSung et al [40] found high accuracy (96%), sensitivity (95%), specificity (100%), PPV (100%), and NPV (67%) for \nMRI with surgical correlation.

Similar to MRI, US is considered a reliable method \nto evaluate patients with Morton\u2019s  neuroma . US has the advantage of allowing clinical correlation during \nexamination. High sensitivities for US and MRI (83% \u201396% and 82% \u201396%, respectively) with no significant \ndifferences between the two modalities were found in a meta- analysis [36].

Given that, some of the find ings in patients with plantar fasciitis are nonspecific; these findings can also \nbe seen in asymptomatic patients.  MRI should always be correlated with clinical symptoms to avoid overcalling \nplantar fasciitis. Although no significant differences have been found in plantar fascia thickness on US and MRI, \nMRI is currently considered the most sensitive imaging study  in the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis [53]. There is no \nrelevant literature supporting the routine use of contrast in the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis or tears.  \nUS Foot  \nUS has shown good sensitivity (80%) and specificity (88%) in the dia gnosis of plantar fasciitis when compared to \nMRI [54].

Kapoor et al [56]  showed higher \nsensitivity and specificity of US elastography when compared to US in the detection of plantar fasciitis (95% and \n100% versus 66% and 75%, respectively) , using  MRI as the reference standard. US has been shown to be useful in \nthe diagnosis of complete and partial tears of the plantar fascia [57]. Some authors regard US to be superior to MRI \nin differentiating true fiber interruption and tearing of the plantar fascia from edema [58]. \nVariant 5: Nonradiating chronic midfoo t pain of suspected osseous origin. Radiographs negative or \nequivocal. Clinical concern includes occult fracture, or painful accessory ossicles. Next imaging study.  \nBone Scan Foot  \nBone scintigraphy is a sensitive but not specific technique to detect occult  fractures because of  its capability to \ndetect increased osteoblastic activity. Although bone scans may reveal focal uptake at the site of a radiographically \noccult fracture, given the anatomical complexity of the foot particularly the midfoot, precise localization may be \nlimited [59]. SPECT/CT may improve the diagnosis of patients with suspected fractures because of the more precise \nanatomical localization [60].  \nSymptomatic accessory navicular bones were initially studied with Tc-99m -MDP bone scans and were repo rted to \nshow increased radiotracer uptake at the synchondrosis,  apparently  due to the chronic stress reaction [61] . A \nnegative bone scan can exclude the presence of a symptomatic accessory ossicle, but positive findings lack \nspecificity [62]. Isotope bone scans , when combined with CT , may be positive in cases of painful accessory ossicles \nbut remain rel ative ly insensitive for some soft -tissue pathology [63].  \nCT Foot  \nCT is useful for the detection of radiographically occult fractures. Almeida et al [64]  reported visualization of \nChopart fractures on  CT and/or MRI in one -third of cases initially not diagnosed on radiographs . CT also has utility \nin the diagnosis of occult fractures involving the subtalar joint as demonstrated in the study by Choi et al [6 5]. CT \nis a primary imaging technique in patients with high-energy polytrauma and complex fractures, because radiographs \nhave only poor to moderate sensitivity  in this clinical setting [66] . More recently, dual -energy CT has been reported \nas a useful technique in the detection of bone marrow edema , with excellent performance in the appendicular \nskeleton, with a sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 93% [67].

Differentiation between a bipartite \nversus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess \nwith radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton\u2019s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other \ncauses of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg\u2019s infraction , and stress fractures.

The \ncombination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a \nspecificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15]. \nUS Foot  \nUltrasound (US) is usually not indicate d as the first imaging  study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain, but may \nbe performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of pathologic conditions of the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, \nand other conditions such as tarsal tunnel syndrome, Morton\u2019s  neuroma , plantar plate tears,  and intermetatarsal \nbursitis. \nVariant 2: Persistent posttraumatic foot pain.

There are scenarios in which no imaging beyond baseline \nradiographs is necessary, but in other situations advanced imaging has added value for diagnostic eva luation and \ntreatment planning.  \nOverview of Imaging Modalities  \nRadiographs  \nImaging evaluation of the painful wrist should begin with radiog raphs [1,2]. This simple study may establish a \nspecific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, \nimpaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -\nanterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or \nmore oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling \n[3]. A v ariety of stress positions and maneuvers can be performed to elicit dynamic instability that is not visible \non standard radiographs [ 4]. Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. \nAdditionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ]. \nIn the past , fluoroscopic observation was used to establish the diagnosis of dynamic wrist inst ability.

However, while it is sensitive to bone abnormalities, scintigraphy \nsuffers from a lack of specificity [6 ]. Furthermore, bone scans cannot detect soft -tissue abnormalities  such as  \nlesions of the ligaments, tendons, and cartilage, all of which are often responsible for chronic wrist pain.  \nArthrography  \nConventional (x-ray) arthrography can be performed with contrast injection into the radiocarpal joint al one or into \nthe radiocarpal, mi dcarpal, and distal radioulnar joints ( 3-phase technique) for the diagnosis of triangular \nfibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tear and intrinsic ligament perforations. A recent meta -analysis found only \nmoderate pooled sensitivity (76%) for the detection of full -thickness TFCC tears (82% for 3 -phase technique and \n72% for single -injection arthrograms)  [7]. However, arthrography is unable to reliably show the size, shape, and \nstability of TFCC defects and is insensitive to partial-thickness tears. Similarly, while conventional arthrography can be used to diagnose full -thickness defects in the intrinsic intercarpal ligaments, it is unable to identify which \ncomponents of those ligaments are affected, to distinguish degenerative from traumatic lesions, to find partial-\nthickness ligament tears, to demonstrate abnormalities of the extrinsic ligaments, or to show extra-articular \n \naPrincipal Author,  Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri.", "In other patients, nonspecific radiologic findings (including those in the soft  tissues) combined with the history and physical examination may be \nsufficient for clinical diagnosis, or may suggest preferred secondary imaging studies.  \nMRI  \nMRI is no t routinely used in the initial evaluation of chronic wrist pain.", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 12 Chronic Wrist Pain  CT Wrist  \nCT, with or without IV  contrast, is not routinely used to further e valuate ulnar -sided chronic wrist pain when \nradiographs are normal or nonspecific.  \nBone Scan  Wrist  \nBone scan is not routinely used to further evaluate ulnar -sided chronic wrist pain when radiographs are normal or \nnonspecific . \nVariant 6: Radial -sided chroni c wrist pain.

IV contrast seldom provides added benefit in patients w ith radial -sided wrist \npain but may increase sensitivity for ligament lesions if MR arthrography is desired but direct joint injection is not \nfeasible.  \nMR Arthrography  Wrist  \nDirect MR arthrography (with contrast injection either into the radiocarpal joint or into all three  compartments of \nthe wrist) may be appropriate in this scenario; the examination has higher sensitivity than noncontrast -enhanced \nMRI\u2014even when performed at 3.0 T \u2014for diagnosis of complete and incomplete scapholunate and lunotriquetral \nligament tears [3 ,8,38]. For the scapholunate ligament, direct MR  arthrography also allows more accurate \ndetermination of which specific segments of the ligament are torn compared to conventional MRI [43], which has \nimportant biomechanical implications for wrist stability. Direct MR arthrography also has an advantage over \nnoncontrast -enhanced MRI for diagnosing extrinsic ligament abnormalities [44].  \nCT Arthrography  Wrist  \nThe accuracy of CT arthrography and MR arthrography are similar for lesions of the scapholunate ligament [8 ]. \nCompared to conventional MRI, CT arthrography may be more sensitive for tears of the biomechanically \nimportant dorsal ligament fibers [16]. In contrast to MRI and MR arthrography, CT arthrography is less sensitive \nfor diagnosis of extra -articular findings (like ganglion cysts and tendon disorders) t hat can cause radial -sided pain.  \nCT arthrography may be appropriate in this scenario.  \nCT Wrist  \nCT, with or without IV contrast,  is not routinely used to further evaluate chronic radial -sided wrist pain when \nradiographs are normal or nonspecific.  \nUS Wrist  \nWhile some investigators have tried high-resolution US with or  without arthrography for diagnosing intrinsic \nligament [41,42], its sensitivity in comparison to MRI, MR arthrography, and CT arthrography is unknown. \nAdditionally, imaging with US is largely limited to the dorsal fibers of the ligaments [42]. US may be appropriate \nin cases of suspected de Quervain disease (stenosing tenosynovitis of the abductor pollicis longus and extensor \npollicis brevis tendon compartment), where preoperative identification of a septum or subcompartmentalization \nwithin the first dorsal compartment with US may affect surgical management [18,19]. US may be appropriate in \npatients with radial -sided pain in cases where extra-articular pathology is the primary consideration.  \nArthrography  Wrist  \nConventional (x-ray) arthrography has largely been supplanted by CT arthrogra phy and MR arthrography because \nthese cross-sectional studies are better able to predict which fibers of the scapholunate ligament are torn and \nwhether any repairable fibers remain , both of which are important features that affect operative management . \nAdditionally, while fibrocartilage and ligament perforations are moderately associated with ulnar -sided wrist pain, \nthere is a poor correlation between ligament lesions and radial -sided pain [45].

Radiographs normal or nonspecific. Suspect carpal tunnel syndrome.  Next \nstudy. \nUS Wrist \nSeveral meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the \ncarpal  tunnel  inlet) is highly accurate for identifying carpal  tunnel syndrome  diagnosed clinically or with the \ncombination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US \nvaries depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the \nmeasurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary \nexamination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel \nsyndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal \ntunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, \nclinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of \ncarpal tunnel syndrome. US may be appropriate in cases where this initial evaluation is equivocal.  \nMRI Wrist  \nHistorically, carpal tunnel syndrome has been diagnosed based on clinical signs and sympt oms and confirmed by \nthe results of electrodiagnostic studies [67]. MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in cases in which this  \ninitial evaluation is equivocal. The MRI findings that have been reported in wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome \u2014\nincluding nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing\u2014may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value \nin patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68]. In rare cases of secondary carpal tunnel syndrome, MRI may identify \na mass lesion compressing the median nerve. There is some evidence that the length of T2 hyperintensity in the \nmedian nerve can help prognosticate the success of surgery [69] and that the shape and signal of the nerve predict \nclinical response to a steroid injection in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome [70 ].

MRI is useful for diagnosing infectious and noninfectious tenosynovitis in \nboth the flexor and extensor wrist compartments [46]. Occult ganglion cysts are also easily identified with MRI, \nbut some authors recommend use of IV contrast to distinguish ganglia from synovitis [ 47]. For noncystic soft-\ntissue masses, MRI may demonstrate findings that are diagnostic for certain benign conditions (eg, lipomas, \nhemangiomas, benign nerve sheath tumors), and can stage the extent of involvement for nonspecific masses ( see \nthe ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae topic on \u201c Soft-Tissue Masses \u201d [48]). \nUS Wrist  \nWrist US or MRI (without or without  and with IV contrast) are alternative initial examinations that are usually \nappropriate in this setting.

CT may have a role in cases in which calcification or ossification \nis demo nstrated radiologically, or in the staging of a lesion that is first evaluated by MRI or US , but CT with or \nwithout IV contrast are usually not appropriate initial examinations for a suspected soft -tissue mass.  \nMR Arthrography  Wrist  \nMR arthrography is not routinely used to evaluate a palpable mass or ganglion cyst.  \nCT Arthrography  Wrist  \nCT arthrography is not routinely used to evaluate a palpable mass or ganglion cyst.  \nBone Scan  Wrist  \nBone scan is not routinely used to evaluate a palpable mass or ganglion c yst. \nArthrography  Wrist  \nRadiographic arthrography  is not routinely used to evaluate a palpable mass or ganglion cyst . \nVariant 10: Chronic wrist pain.

In patients with persistent symptoms thought to be due to an occult wrist \nfracture, MRI can be used as an alternative to presumptive casting and repeat radiographs [ 12].

Radiographs normal or nonspecific . Next study.  \nMRI Wrist  \nBoth traumatic and degenerative lesions of the TFCC can produce chronic, ulnar -sided wrist pain . MRI is highly \naccurate for lesions involving the radial (central) zone of the disc, especially with the use of high -resolution fast \nspin-echo or 3-D grad ient-recalled pulse sequences [36]. There is some evidence suggesting that MRI performed \nwith a 3.0 T system is even more accurate than MRI performed with a 1.5 T system for TFCC lesions [37], but \nthere are no studies comparing the accuracy of the two field s trengths in the same patients. The sensitivity for \ntears of the ulnar attachment of the disc and the peripheral attachments (the ulnocarpal ligaments) are only fair \nwith noncontrast -enhanced wrist MRI [ 12,36]. IV contrast seldom provides added benefit in patients with ulnar -\nsided wrist pain but may increase sensitivity for TFCC lesions if MR arthrography is desired but direct joint \ninjection is not feasible. \nMR Arthrography  Wrist  \nDirect MR arthrography (performed with contrast injection of the radiocarpal or distal radioulnar compartments, \nalone or in combination) does result in better diagnostic accuracy for the T FCC compared with conventional MRI, \nespecially for ulnar -sided lesions [26, 38], even when compared to conventio nal MRI performed with a 3.0 T \nmagnet [7,8,39]. The same is true for intrinsic ligament injuries, such as those of the lunotriquetral ligament, \nwhich can produce ulnar -sided pain [7 ,8,39]. Performing either MR arthrography or noncontrast -enhanced MRI is \nusually appropriate in this scenario.  \nCT Arthrography  Wrist  \nThe accuracy of CT arthrography is superior to MRI  and similar to that  of MR arthrography for TFCC and \nintrinsic ligament lesions [8,40]. In addition, CT arthrography appears to be mor e accurate than either MRI or  MR \narthrography for identifying articular cartilage defects in the wrist [38]. In contrast to MRI and MR arthrography, \nCT arthrography is less sensitive to lesions occurring outside of the joint (like abnormalities of the extensor carpi \nulnaris tendon) that can result in ulnar -sided pain.  For these reasons, CT arthrography may be appropriate in this \nsetting , especially if there is a contraindication to MRI or if artifact from metallic implants produce too much \nartifact on MRI.  \nArthrography  Wrist  \nConventional (x-ray) arthrography\u2014performed with contrast injection into one  or more  wrist compartments\u2014has \nmoderate accuracy for the diagnosis of TFCC perforations [7 ]."], ["As such,  noncontrast  MRI should be considered  as the next imaging test following  \nradiographic  evaluation  of the hip joint [25-34].

CT kne e without IV contrast may also be useful to \nconfirm a prior osseous injury.  \nCT with IV contrast is not usually indicated to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  \nCT without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated to eva luate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous \nknee injury.  \nCT Arthrography  Knee  \nCT arthrography may be used to evaluate the menisci, articular cartilage, and the presence of loose bodies with \nreported sensitivities and specificities ranging from 86 % to 100%  [16,62-64 ]. \nMRI Knee  \nMRI without IV contrast may be indicated when radiographs demonstrate a small osseous fragment along the \nmedial patellar margin or if there is a clinical concern for prior or chronic patellar dislocation -relocation.  MRI can \nassess the integrity of the medial patellofemoral ligament and medial patellar retinaculum, define the extent of \ncartilage injury, and identify loose bodies [41].  MRI is useful for evaluating Osgood-Schlatter or Sinding -Larsen -\nJohansson syndrome [41].  If the radiograph suggests prior anterior cruciate ligament  injury, MRI can effectively \nevaluate the menisci , but evaluation for associated cartilage lesions is less useful [65].  \nMRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) \nosseous knee injury.  \nMR Arthrography  Knee  \nMR arthrography is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with s igns of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  \nUS Knee  \nUS is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  \nBone Scan Knee  \nRadionuclide bone scan is usually not indicated to evaluate patients with signs of prior  (chronic) osseous knee \ninjury.  \nImage -Guided Aspiration Knee  \nJoint aspiration is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  \nSummary of Recommendations  \n\u2022 Variant 1:  Radiographs  of the knee  are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of  chronic knee pain in \npatients greater than or equal to 5 years of age.  \n\u2022 Variant 2:  MRI knee without  IV contrast is usually appropriate in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of \nage with chronic knee pain when initial knee  radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion.  \n\u2022 Variant 3:  MRI knee without  IV contrast is usually appropriate  in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of \nage with chronic knee pain when initial knee radiographs demonstrate OCD,  loose bodies, or history of \ncartilage or meniscal repair.  \n\u2022 Variant 4:  (1) MRI knee without IV contrast  or (2)  knee aspiration or (3)  CT knee without  IV contrast may \nbe appropriate  in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of age with chronic knee pain when initial \nradiographs de monstrate degenerative changes or chondrocalcinosis.

New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or \npatients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee \npain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the \norigin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. \nSubchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed \nspontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to \nelderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs \noften initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, \nand progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is \nsuspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria\n\u00ae \ntopic on \u201c Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae \u201d [28]. \nSome patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using \nquantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs \nexhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ]. \nPatellofemoral car tilage loss is also associated with chronic knee pain , with active knee pain correlated with \nBMLs [30,31]. Similar to CT, MRI can calculate various anatomic measurements associated with patellofemoral \nsubluxation/dislocation and lateral patellofemoral friction syndrome [32-34]. Bone marrow edema in the classic \nlocation for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also \ndifferentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise \ntherapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. \nOther etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat \npad impingement syndromes, Hoffa\u2019s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome, adhesive \ncapsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes , \nand osteonecrosis [15, 19,36-45].  \nMRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a \njoint effusion. However, contrast -enhanced images ma y be more accurate in diagnosing other causes of chronic \nknee pain , such as Hoffa\u2019s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome, and adhesive \ncapsulitis [15].  In particular, enh ancing synovitis thicker than 2 mm in Hoffa\u2019s fat is correlated with peripatellar \npain [46]. Contrast -enhanced MRI is also useful in quantifying the degree of synovitis and in evaluating \nconditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis [ 17,42,47,48].  \nMR Arthrography  Knee  \nMR arthrography performed with an intra -articular injection of dilute gadolinium solution is typically not \nindicated as a second exam ination  but rather reserved for patients with known prior meniscal surgery, chondral \nand osteochondral lesions , and suspected loose bodies  [10].", "ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 10 Acute  Trauma  to the Knee  US study  by Dai et al including  551 patients  from  7 prospective  studies revealed  pooled sensitivity  of 88% and \nspecificity  of 90% in diagnosis  of meniscal  injuries  [46]. \nAnother  meta -analysis of 4 US studies including  246 patients  revealed  pooled sensitivity  of 90% and specificity  of \n97% in the diagnosis  of ACL  injuries  [47].

CT arthrography provides  a \ncomparable alternative  to MR arthrography in the evaluation  of rotator  cuff tendon tears [16,17] . CT arthrography \nis able to detect  very subtle  articular  surface cuff defects,  but, because of lack of contrast  extension  from  the \nglenohumeral  joint space,  it is less effective at demonstrating bursal  surface or intrasubstance tears,  which  are \ntypically  well seen with MRI or US [18]. \nCT Shoulder  With  IV Contrast  \nThere is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of CT shoulder  with IV contrast  in the evaluation  of chronic  \nshoulder  pain when  rotator  cuff disorder  or subacromial  subdeltoid bursitis  is suspected.  \nCT Shoulder  Without  and With  IV Contrast  \nThere is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of CT shoulder  without  and with IV contrast  in the evaluation  of \nchronic  shoulder  pain when  rotator  cuff disorder  or subacromial  subdeltoid  bursitis  is suspected.  \nCT Shoulder  Without  IV Contrast  \nCT shoulder  without  IV contrast  is of limited  utility  when  evaluating  for rotator  cuff tear or subacromial  subdeltoid  \nbursitis. Noncontrast  CT can sometimes  demonstrate fatty infiltration  of rotator  cuff muscles with a corresponding \nrotator  cuff tear, although  the overall  sensitivity  of this finding  is low [19]. CT may demonstrate a high-riding  \nhumeral  head  or remodeling  of the acromial  undersurface in patients  with large  rotator  cuff tears.  However,  this \nfinding  is generally  seen on initial radiographs , and CT does not allow  for characterization  of the underlying tear \nbecause CT lacks the soft-tissue contrast  resolution  necessary  to adequately  evaluate the rotator  cuff tear itself.

See the separate ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae topics  on \u201cChronic  Extremity  Joint  Pain-Suspected  \nInflammatory  Arthritis \u201d [2], \u201cImaging After  Shoulder  Arthroplasty \u201d [3], \u201cPrimary  Bone  Tumors \u201d [4], \u201cSoft-Tissue \nMasses \u201d [5], and \u201cShoulder  Pain-Traumatic \u201d [6] if further guidance  is needed  for potential alternative  causes of \nshoulder  pain.  \nSpecial Imaging  Considerations   \nSeveral  studies have  looked for ways to shorten  typical  shoulder  conventional  MRI or MR arthrogram  protocols  \nwhile  maintaining  diagnostic  accuracy.  Isotropic  3-D imaging has been  increasingly  used as a substitute  for \nconventional  multiplanar  2-D MRI,  with a similar  sensitivity  and specificity  for rotator  cuff tear and labral  \nabnormalities  at a lower  scan time [7,8] . Faster  scans can also be performed  using 2-D fast spin echo  sequences  \nwith parallel  imaging , which  produce  similar  findings  as seen on conventional  MRI [9]. \nInitial Imaging  Definition \nInitial imaging  is defined  as imaging  at the beginning of the care episode for the medical  condition defined  by the \nvariant.  More  than one procedure  can be considered  usually  appropriate  in the initial imaging  evaluation  when : \n\u2022 There are procedures  that are equivalent  alternatives (ie, only one procedure  will be ordered  to \nprovide  the clinical  information  to effectively  manage the patient\u2019s  care)  \nOR \n\u2022 There are complementary  procedures  (ie, more  than one procedure  is ordered  as a set or \nsimultaneously  where each procedure  provides  unique  clinical  information  to effectively  manage  \nthe patient\u2019s  care).  \n \naPanel Vice- chair, University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, Virginia. bPanel Chair, Mayo Clinic Arizona, Phoenix, Arizona. cUniversity of \nWisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin. dStanford University, Stanford, California, Primary care physician. eMayo Clinic, \nRochester, Minnesota. fHospital for Special Surgery, New York, New York.", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 12 Chronic Shoulder Pain  Image -Guided Anesthetic +/- Corticosteroid  Injection  Shoulder  or Surrounding  Structures  \nImage -guided injection  of the glenohumeral  joint for adhesive capsulitis  can be performed  with either  fluoroscopy \nor US guidance . Image -guided cortico steroid  injection  has been  shown  to have  a significant  reduction in pain and \nan improvement  in the range  of motion  for patients  with adhesive capsulitis  [105,106] . Use of US guidance  for \nglenohumeral  cortico steroid  injection  may be more  accurate and produce  a greater  improvement  in pain and \nfunctional  scores relative  to blind  injection  [107] . Patients  with adhesive capsulitis  have  been  found to be the only \ngroup with a statistically  better  outcome  after glenohumeral  joint injection  than other  patients;  thus a positive  \nresponse to a glenohumeral  injection  can be suggestive  of the presence of adhesive capsulitis  in the appropriate  \nclinical  context  [23]. Fluoroscopic  injection  can also demonstrate diagnostic  findings  suggestive of adhesive  \ncapsulitis  including  joint space capacity  <10 mL, diminished axillary  recess,  and irregularity  of the capsular  margin  \n[108] . \nMR Arthrography  Shoulder  \nMengiardi  et al [109]  reported  that thickening  of the coracohumeral  ligament  (specificity  95%,  sensitivity  59%),  \nthickening  of the joint capsule (specificity  86%,  sensitivity  64%) , and obliteration  of the subcoracoid  triangle  \n(specificity  100%,  sensitivity  32%)  are characteristic  MR arthrograph y findings  in adhesive capsulitis . However,  \nfluid  within  the rotator  interval  or along  the axillary  recess due to the arthrogram  injection  itself  can serve as a \nlimitation  to detecting  findings  of adhesive capsulitis  on MRI arthrography.  \nMRI Shoulder  Without  and With  IV Contrast  \nContrast -enhanced  MRI can increase the conspicuity of axillary  recess capsular  thickening [110]  and rotator  interval  \nsoft-tissue thickening [111] , although there  are conflicting  data on the relationship  of this capsular  enhancement  \nwith patient  symptoms  [112] . \nMRI Shoulder  Without  IV Contrast  \nZhao  et al [113]  showed  that coracohumeral  ligament thickening,  anterior  capsule thickening,  and obliteration  of \nthe subcoracoid  fat are the most  characteristic findings  of adhesive capsulitis  on conventional  MRI.  Chi et al [114]  \nfound a sensitivity  of 77% and a specificity  of 53% for adhesive capsulitis  with only coracohumeral  ligament  \nthickening  on noncontrast  MRI,  with a lower  sensitivity  (23%)  but a higher  specificity  (87%)  in patients  who had \nall 3 findings  of adhesive capsulitis , including  coracohumeral  ligament  thickening,  rotator  interval  infiltration, and \naxillary  recess thickening.  \nRadiography Shoulder  Additional Views  \nThere is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of additional  radiographic  views in the evaluation  of chronic  \nshoulder  pain when  adhesive capsulitis  is suspected.  \nUS Shoulder  \nUS in the setting  of potential adhesive capsulitis  is often  used to exclude rotator  cuff tear. Although there are several  \nUS findings  that can be seen in patients  with adhesive capsulitis,  US is not typically  performed  specifically  for this \nindication. Thickening of the coracohumeral  ligament, increased  rotator  interval  soft tissue,  and decrease d external  \nrotation  on dynamic  US are all highly sensitive and specific findings  for adhesive capsulitis  [115]."], ["US-guided injection  of cortico steroid  into the glenohumeral  joint has been  found  to improve  \npain and range  of motion  in patients  with prior  rotator  cuff repair,  without  increasing  the risk of recurrent  rotator  \ncuff tear [149] . There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of image  guided injection  for diagnostic  purposes  \nin evaluation  for recurrent  cuff tear, but it may be of use for diagnosis  in patients with suspected  subacromial  \nsubdeltoid bursitis. \nMR Arthrography  Shoulder  \nMR arthrography is useful  in the evaluation  of the postoperative  rotator  cuff. MR arthrography  can improve  \ndiagnostic  accuracy  over conventional  MRI in patients  who have  had prior  rotator  cuff repair  due to joint distention  \nand improved  signal -to-noise  ratio [150] . Of note,  contrast within  the subacromial  subdeltoid bursa  on routine  and \nMR arthrogram  examinations is a nonspecific finding  that can potentially  be seen in a nonwatertight  rotator  cuff \nrepair  [151] . T2 hyperintensity of the repaired  rotator  cuff tendon is a common postoperative  finding,  particularly  \nin the first 2 years after surgery,  and does not reflect  adequacy  of tendon healing  or clinical  outcome  [152] .", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 15 Chronic Shoulder Pain  Radiography Shoulder  Additional Views  \nGlenohumeral  osteoarthritis  is typically  well visualized  on conventional  radiographic  views,  without  the need  for \nspecial  views.  A standard  axillary  view can demonstrate posterior  subluxation of the humeral  head  and abnormal  \nglenoid morphology in patients with severe osteoarthritis  [145-147] . A measurement  of the critical shoulder  angle  \ncan be drawn  on routine  AP radiographs  by measuring  the angle  between  a line along the glenoid  surface and a line \nfrom  the inferior glenoid to the lateral  acromial  margin;  patients  with a higher  measurement  may be at high risk of \nhaving a full thickness rotator  cuff tear [148] . \nUS Shoulder  \nAlthough secondary  signs  of osteoarthritis  such as osteophytes,  joint effusion , and intra-articular  bodies  can be seen \nwith US [142] , it is not typically  performed  for this indication.  \nVariant  8: Chronic  shoulder  pain.

CT arthrography provides  a \ncomparable alternative  to MR arthrography in the evaluation  of rotator  cuff tendon tears [16,17] . CT arthrography \nis able to detect  very subtle  articular  surface cuff defects,  but, because of lack of contrast  extension  from  the \nglenohumeral  joint space,  it is less effective at demonstrating bursal  surface or intrasubstance tears,  which  are \ntypically  well seen with MRI or US [18]. \nCT Shoulder  With  IV Contrast  \nThere is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of CT shoulder  with IV contrast  in the evaluation  of chronic  \nshoulder  pain when  rotator  cuff disorder  or subacromial  subdeltoid bursitis  is suspected.  \nCT Shoulder  Without  and With  IV Contrast  \nThere is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of CT shoulder  without  and with IV contrast  in the evaluation  of \nchronic  shoulder  pain when  rotator  cuff disorder  or subacromial  subdeltoid  bursitis  is suspected.  \nCT Shoulder  Without  IV Contrast  \nCT shoulder  without  IV contrast  is of limited  utility  when  evaluating  for rotator  cuff tear or subacromial  subdeltoid  \nbursitis. Noncontrast  CT can sometimes  demonstrate fatty infiltration  of rotator  cuff muscles with a corresponding \nrotator  cuff tear, although  the overall  sensitivity  of this finding  is low [19]. CT may demonstrate a high-riding  \nhumeral  head  or remodeling  of the acromial  undersurface in patients  with large  rotator  cuff tears.  However,  this \nfinding  is generally  seen on initial radiographs , and CT does not allow  for characterization  of the underlying tear \nbecause CT lacks the soft-tissue contrast  resolution  necessary  to adequately  evaluate the rotator  cuff tear itself.  CT \nmay be able to directly  demonstrate  some  large rotator  cuff tears  as well as fatty infiltration  of the rotator  cuff \nmusculature;  however , it was found to have  a sensitivity  of 20% for full thickness  rotator  cuff tears in one small  \nstudy [19]. Large  amounts  of fluid  in the subacromial  subdeltoid  bursa  can sometimes be visualized  with CT. \nFDG -PET/CT  Skull Base to Mid-Thigh \nThere is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of FDG -PET/CT skull  base to mid-thigh  in the evaluation  of chronic  \nshoulder  pain when  rotator  cuff disorder  or subacromial  subdeltoid bursitis  is suspected."], ["Postoperative  abnormalities  and associated  conditions  include  patients\u2019  dissatisfaction,  prosthetic  \nloosening,  glenohumeral  instability, polyethylene  wear,  osteolysis,  periprosthetic  fracture,  impingement  (mainly  \nwith reverse  total shoulder  arthroplasti es), tears of the rotator  cuff tendons,  infection, nerve  injury,  and deltoid  \ndysfunction [3].

These  prostheses were preferentially  \nused for younger  patients  with osteoarthritis  [7]. However , reports  of high short -term  failure  rates led to recalls  and \ndecreased  use [8,9] . These articulations  (and also metal  to metal  articulations  at the head  neck  [trunnion] and neck  \nstem  articulation s of modular  components)  may result  in the release of metal  particles and metal  ions leading  to \nmacroscopic necrosis,  osteolysis,  large sterile  hip effusions,  and periprosthetic  solid  and cystic masses termed  \n\u201cpseudotumors\u201d  [10].

Kransdorf,  MD.o  \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nFractures of the proximal femur (commonly referred to as hip fractures)  are a frequent  source of morbidity and \nmortality in elderly osteoporotic patients [1]. Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type \nresult in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men \n[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs \nwill continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of \nlife following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays \nin diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -\nand long-term mortality [6-13]. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of hip fractures is critical. Hip fractures \ncannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded on the basis of physical exam ination  alone ; therefore , imaging plays a \nkey role in early  and accurate diagnosis [14] . \nThe biomechanics of proximal femoral and pelvic fractures that are a result of major trauma differs as these \ninjuries may be seen in any age group, often with additional accompanying high-velocity injuri es of the abdomen \nand pelvis . Motor vehicle \u2013related trauma is the most common  mechanism. Thorough evaluation of the hip may be \nsuperseded  in these instances by the need for resuscitation and diagnosis and treatment of more urgent associated \nvascular or solid organ injuries. Imaging plays an important role not only in the diagnosis of high-velocity \nfractures but also in characterizing fracture mechanism and morphology for treatment planning purposes.  \nHowever, imaging of high-velocity hip fractures occurs in the context of a broader trauma evaluation. A full \ndiscussion of the broader imaging workup of blunt trauma is beyond the scope of this paper and will be covered in \nthe upcoming ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae titled \u201cMajor Blunt Trauma\u201d and will be made available on the \nACR website  when completed . \nTreatment  for both intra - and extracapsular proximal femoral fractures in the elderly is typically surgical fixation  \nbecause of the risk of further fracture displacement and the dangers of prolonged immobilization in the elderly \n[15]. Joint replacement may be  performed for displaced fractures of the femoral neck where the risk of femoral \nhead avascular necrosis is high. Fractures from high -force trauma are also commonly treated with surgical \nfixation for stability to reduce the risk of post -traumatic osteo arthritis. \nDiscussion of Procedures by Variant  \nVariant 1:  Acute hip pain. Fall or minor trauma. Suspect fracture. Initial imaging.  \nRadiography Hip \nRadiography is the initial imaging modality of choice for assessment of acute hip pain with suspected fracture , \nwith the more advanced imaging modalities reserved for instances of clinically suspected fracture in the setting of \nnegative or equivocal radiographs. Radiographs are rapidly obtained and well tolerated by patients. When a \nfracture is demonstrated , freque ntly no more imaging is needed for treatment planning purposes [15 -17]."], ["Galley et al [110]  used optimized  MRI  sequences and found irregular  soft tissue mass,  soft tissue edema,  bone  \ndestruction,  and fistulas  to be significant  features  of periprosthetic  infection, with sensitivities  of 47.4%  to 100% \nand specificities of 73.1%  to 100.0%.

However,  a nondis placed  fracture  \nmay be difficult to see on MRI if there is only mild associated  marrow edema,  and susceptibility  artifact  from  the \nprosthesis may obscure  the pertinent  findings  [72].

The identification  of periprosthetic  infection  is critical  to choosing  \nappropriate  treatment  but diagnosis  can be challenging  [75]. Guidelines  for patient evaluation  have  been  developed  \n[76]. A definition  of periprosthetic  infection  has been  proposed by the musculoskeletal  infection  society  that \nincludes  major  and minor  criteria  but not specifically  imaging criteria  [75]. \nBone  Scan  and Gallium  Scan  Hip \nThe most  recent  data on bone  and gallium  scans for diagnosing periprosthetic  hip infection  are more  than 25 years  \nold because this test has been  largely  replaced  by labeled  leukocyte  and marrow  imaging  and FDG -PET [77-79]. \nBone  Scan and Gallium  Scan  with SPECT  or SPECT/CT Hip \nThere is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of bone  and gallium  scan with SPECT or SPECT/CT of the hip as \nthese tests have  been  replaced  by leukocyte  and bone  marrow  imaging  and FDG-PET for diagnosing  periprosthetic  \nhip infection.  \nBone  Scan  Hip \nBone  scan of the hip is sensitive but not specific for periprosthetic  hip infection.  Performing  the test as a 3-phase  \nbone  scan does not improve  accuracy,  with reported  sensitivity  and specificity  ranging  from  29% to 88% and 50% \nto 92%,  respectively  [61,80 -82]. \nBone  Scan  with  SPECT  or SPECT/CT  Hip \nSchweizer  et al [83] retrospectively  studied  58 total hip prostheses,  including  31 symptomati c and 27 asymptomatic  \nprostheses,  with bone  scan with SPECT/CT.

In 2012,  >670,000 knee  replacement  procedures  were performed  in the United  States  [3], which  represents \nan increase of 86% since 2003  [4]. It is estimated  that 4 million  patients  in the United  States  are currently  living  \nwith a knee  replacement  [5]. By 2030,  it is estimated  that the annual  demand  for primary  TKA  will grow  by 673%  \nto 3.48 million  [6]. Factors contributing  to the rising  number  of TKAs include  population growth;  aging  and \nincreased  longevity of the population;  expanded indications  for performing  TKA,  especially  in individuals  >65 \nyears of age; obesity;  decline in postprocedure  complications;  and increased  patient  demand  [7]. \nThe patient  satisfaction  rate for TKA is relatively  high,  ranging  from  75% to 89% [8]. Around  10% to 30% of the \npatients  report  ongoing pain or are not satisfied  with the result  [9]. Factors,  which  contribute  to patient  \ndissatisfaction , include  unmet  expectations,  functional  limitations,  and postoperative  complications  including pain \n[10]. Most  TKA  patients  expe rience improved outcomes  and long implant survival,  with long-term  TKA failure  \nrates of <1% per year [5]. The growth in the number  of primary  TKA  procedures  has been  accompanied  by increased  \nrates of TKA revision  procedures  [1]. Revision  procedures  for TKAs have  increased  by 5.4 procedures  per 100,000  \npersons  per decade over the period from  1990  to 2002,  with a mean  revision  burden of 8.2%  [11]. Nearly  1.5 million  \nof those  with primary  knee  replacement  are 50 to 69 years  of age, underscoring a large population at risk for revision  \nsurgery  and long-term  complications  [5]. Sharkey  et al [12] reviewed  781 revision  TKAs and found  the most  \ncommon  failure  mechanisms  were  loosening (39.9%),  infection  (27.4%),  instability  (7.5%),  periprosthetic  fracture  \n(4.7%),  and arthrofibrosis  (4.5%) .

Additional imaging  following  radiographs. \nInfection  is a serious complication  of joint arthroplasty  and is reported  in 0.8%  to 1.9%  of TKAs [43]. The frequency  \nof infection  is increasing  as the number  of primary  arthroplasties increases [44]. Infection  may be acute  or delayed , \nwith delayed  infection  defined  as occurring at least 3 months  postoperatively  [45]. In a series,  infection  was \nresponsible  for 37.6%  of early  revisions  and 21.9%  of revisions  performed  >2 years after the initial operation [12]. \nStaphylococcus  aureus  and coagulase-negative  Staphylococcus  species,  including  Staphylococcus  epidermidis,  are \nthe most  common organisms  associated  with these infections  [46]. Both  clinical  findings  and laboratory tests may \nserve useful  in addition  to imaging  studies.  Low-grade  or chronic  TKA  infections  may be difficult to diagnose  \npreoperatively.  Duff  et al [18] noted that diagnosis  of infection  was not obvious  in 53% of knees before  revision  \narthroplasty.  Pain is the most  common  presenting  symptom  of infection, but pain is a nonspecific finding [47]. In \nacute infection,  findings  such as pain,  swelling,  warmth,  erythema,  and fever  are common,  whereas chronic  \ninfections  may be manifested  by pain alone  [44]. Night  pain or pain at rest is characteristic of infection, whereas  \npain on weightbearing  is more  characteristic of mechanical  loosening.  Some  authors  suggest  that infection  needs to \nbe excluded  in all patients  with pain persisting  >6 months  after joint replacement  [18]. \nLaboratory findings  in the setting  of TKA infection  are often  nonspecific.  Peripheral  leukocyte  counts  are not \nelevated  in most  patients  with infected  prostheses.  Erythrocyte  sedimentation  rates (ESRs) are abnormal  in patients  \nwith infection, but this finding  may also be seen in uninfected  patients,  limiting  the usefulness of the test [48]. A \nretrospective review of 68 patients  undergoing hip and knee  revision  surgery  indicated  that C-reactive protein  (CRP)  \nwas significantly  higher  in patients  with infection  compared  with those  with loosening (sensitivity  of 79% for all \nprostheses) ; however , a normal  CRP  level  did not exclude  infection  [49]. CRP  has a sensitivity  of 73% to 91% and \na specificity  of 81% to 86% for the diagnosis  of prosthetic  knee  infection  when  a cutoff  of \u226513.5 mg/L  is used [44].", "Although CRP  can be elevated  after surgery,  under  normal  circumstances  it generally  returns  to baseline within  2 \nmonths  [44]. A large multicenter  study found CRP  and joint aspiration  to be the most  useful  tools  to diagnose  \ninfection  [50]. In an attempt  to construct  an algorithm  for evaluating  TKA infection,  Savarino  et al [51] found that \nabnormal  results  for at least 2 of 3 tests (CRP  [cutoff  0.93 mg/L],  ESR [cutoff 27 mm/h],  and fibrinogen  [cutoff  \n432 mg/dL])  led to accurate results for the diagnosis  of infection  (sensitivity, 93%;  specificity,  100%;  accuracy,  \n97%) . More  recently,  interle ukin-6  has also shown  promise  for diagnosing  infection , with higher  predictive  values \nthan most  other  serologic  markers [52], and has shown  excellent  sensitivity  for detecting  infection  after TKA when  \ncombined with CRP  [53]. The American  Academy  of Orthopaedi c Surgeons  (AAOS ) guidelines  strongly  \nrecommend  the use of ESR, CRP , and serum  interleukin -6 testing  for patients  being assessed  for periprosthetic  joint \ninfection  [54]. Serologic  tests can be hard to interpret  when  underlying inflamm atory  arthropathy is present  [28]. \nMore  recently,  the use of an alpha -defensin  laboratory  test has been  described  for the diagnosis  of periprosthetic  \njoint infection.  Alpha -defensin  is an antimicrobial  peptide  that is naturally  released  by neutrophils  responding to a \npathogen in the synovial  fluid.  Used  as a biomarker  for infection  in synovial  fluid, it has been  demonstrated  to be \nhighly accurate in the diagnosis  of prosthetic  joint infection, nearly  matching  the Musculoskeletal  Infection  Society  \ndefinition  for prosthe tic joint infection  [55-57]. In a study by Deirmengian  et al [56] of 149 synovial  fluid  aspirates,  \nsynovial  fluid  alpha -defensin  tests alone  demonstrated  a sensitivity  of 97% and a specificity  of 96% for the diagnosis  \nof periprosthetic  joint infection, and the combination of synovial  fluid  alpha -defensin  and CRP  tests demonstrated  \na sensitivity  of 97% and a specificity  of 100%  for the diagnosis  of periprosthetic  joint infection . A recent  review  \nsuggests the preoperative  workup for periprosthetic  infection  should include  serum  ESR rate and CRP , serum  D-\ndimer,  synovial  fluid  culture,  cell count , and differential, leukocyte  esterase,  alpha -defensin,  and synovial  fluid  ESR \n[58].", "ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 4 Imaging  After  Total  Knee  Arthroplasty  IMAGING  AFTER  TOTAL  KNEE  ARTHROPLASTY  \nExpert  Panel  on Musculoskeletal  Imaging:  Eric A.

Single -photon emission  CT \n(SPECT) was shown  to improve  accuracy  of bone  scintigraphy  in a small  group of posttransplant  patients  [30], but \nradionucleotide  scintigraphy  is not commonly  performed  for detection  of osteonecrosis.  Early  limited  data for \nPET/ CT have not been  shown  to useful  in diagnosis  of early  osteonecrosis [31]. More  studies are needed  to see if \nPET/CT may be useful  in the detection  of multifocal osteonecrosis.  \nCT Area  of Interest  With  IV Contrast  \nThere is limited  evidence to support  the use of CT with IV contrast  as the initial imaging  study for clinically  \nsuspected  osteonecrosis.", "ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 5 Osteonecrosis  chondrosarcoma  in older  adults  or chondroblastoma  in adolescents).

Of note,  Zhen-Guo\u2019s  study used a rapid  MR \nprotocol  lasting  only 12 to 15 minute  consisting  only of a coronal  short -tau inversion  recovery  sequence with 11.6%  \nof rate of osteonecrosis in patients  with polymyositis/dermatomyositis. \nVariant  3: Known  osteonecrosis with  articular  collapse  by radiographs.

Preoperative  CT, before  total hip arthroplasty , showed  that 21% of femoral  head  \nosteonecrosis  staged  as ARCO  stage I or II on radiographs  to actually be stage III on CT [49]. With  developing  \ntechnologies  in 3-D printing,  CT also plays an important  role. Li et al [50] reported  that a 3-D guide  plate  in core \ndecompression  led to decreased  surgery  time and blood loss. \nMR Arthrography  Area  of Interest  \nThere is limited  evidence to support  the use of MR arthrography for preoperative  planning  of osteonecrosis.   \nMRI Area  of Interest  Without  and With  IV Contrast  \nNot surprisingly,  the volume  of hip synovitis  seen on contrast -enhanced  MRI was found to be increased  after \nfemoral  head  collapse compared  to precollapse [51]. There is limited  evidence to support  the use of MRI without  \nand with IV contrast  for preoperative  planning of osteonecrosis.   \nMRI Area  of Interest  Without  IV Contrast  \nFor epiphyseal  osteonecrosis,  necrotic volume  has been  shown  to be predictive  of future  articular  collapse . When  \nfemoral  head  necrotic volume  is >30%,  femoral  head  progressed  to collapse in 46% to 83% of cases,  whereas \nfemoral  heads with <30% necrotic volume  progressed  to collapse in <5% of cases [13]. Sagittal view has been  \nshown  to be important  in detection  of articular  collapse on MRI [52]. Similarly,  the volume  of necrotic volume  in \nthe humeral  head  (most  often  found in the superior  medial  aspect)  was measured  as the necrotic  angle  on the mid-\ncoronal  plane.  Humeral  heads  with a necrotic angle  <90\u00b0 did not collapse in the subsequent  24 months  follow -up \n[14].", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 9 Malignant or Aggressive Primary Musculoskeletal Tumor  FDG -PET/MRI  Whole  Body  \nThere  is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of FDG -PET/MRI  in the evaluation  of pulmonary  metastases  during  \nsurveillance  of malignant  or aggressive  primary  musculoskeletal  tumors.  The inherent  decreased  spatial  resolution  \nof MRI  compared  with CT raises  doubts  about  the ability  to identify  small  pulmonary  metastases  with FDG -\nPET/MR I as accurately  as CT. MRI of the lungs  relies  heavily  on the ability  to minimize  respiratory  motion.  \nRadiography  Chest  \nChest  radiography  is less sensitive  than CT chest  imaging  for the detection  of pulmonary  nodules.  Whooley  et al \n[57] found  that 83% of asymptomatic  metastases  were  detected  radiographically  with a positive  predictive  value  of \n92% and a negative  predictive  value  of 97%.  However,  the detection  of more  and smaller  pulmonary  metastases  \nwith CT versus  radiography  has definitely  not improved  survival  rates.  Although  radiography  is less sensitive  for \ndetection  of lung metastases,  how that correlates  with clinically  significant  metastases  is less certain.  \nVariant  4: Malignant  or aggressive  primary  bone  tumor.

Local  recurrence  rates  of bone  sarcomas  are reported  to be approximately  10% to 15% \nin patients  with osteosarcoma  and Ewing  sarcoma  [58-61]. Prognosis  is poor for locally  recurrent  malignant  or \naggressive  bone  tumors,  with postrecurrence  5-year survival  rates  reported  approximately  15% to 30% in patients  \nwith osteosarcoma  and 5% in patients  with Ewing  sarcoma  [60,62] . Factors  associated  with poorer  prognosis  in \npatients  with osteosarcoma  were  size of local  recurrence  (>5 cm) and presence  of distant  metastasis  [60]. \nRecommendations  for local  recurrence  surveillance  imaging  vary amongst  expert  guidelines,  although  all \nacknowledge  the benefit  of clinical  evaluation.  Locally  recurrent  bone  tumors  can often  present  as a soft tissue  \nmass,  and in a study  of osteosarcoma  local  recurrences,  the majority  (approximately  75%)  were  soft tissue  masses  \nrather  than bone  lesions  [60]. Some  guidelines  recommend  clinical  exam ination  to be performed  solely , whereas  \nothers  recommend  in combination  with imaging  [49,51,52,63] . Time  to recurrence  also varies  with tumor  histology.  \nMost  osteosarcoma  local  recurrences  have  been  shown  to occur  within  5 years  of resection.  However,  late \nrecurrence  of both osteosarcoma  and Ewing  sarcoma  have  been  reported  [60,61] . In a study  of locally  recurrent  \nosteosarcoma,  survival  rates  decreased  from  30% at 5 years  to 13% at 10 years,  suggesting  long-term follow -up \nbeyond  5 years  is beneficial.

However, an important age-related risk factor for spinal fracture presenting as LBP  is osteoporosis.  As \nbone mass decreases slowly over time, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age, and differs by sex, race, \nethnicity  [10], and comorbidities. In line with the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations for patients  \nages 65 and older being screened for osteoporosis, patients  >65 years of age may be considered at risk for \nosteoporotic fracture when presenting with LBP . \nAdditionally,  for those  patients without  neurologic  compromise  and who present  with minor  risk factors for cancer,  \ninflammatory  back  disease  (eg, ankylosing spondylitis), vertebral  compression  fracture,  or symptomatic  spinal  \nstenosis,  imaging  should be considered  after a trial of therapy  [4]. \nIn the majority  of patients, no specific pathology for LBP can be identified. Also,  studies have  shown  imaging  \nabnormalities  in a substantial  number  of people  without back  pain [11-13].

If an inflammatory  etiology  is \nsuspected  as the cause of LBP, such as ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic  spondylitis, reactive arthritis, or \ninflammatory  bowel  disease\u2013 related  spine  disorders,  please see the ACR  Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae topic  on \n\u201cInflammatory Back Pain: Known or Suspected Axial Spondyloarthropathy \u201d [14]. \nInitial Imaging  Definition \nInitial imaging  is defined  as imaging  at the beginning of the care episode for the medical  condition defined  by the \nvariant.", "One study found no \nstatistically  significant  difference in primary  outcome  after 1 year for patients  \u226565 years of age  who had spine  \nimaging  within  6 weeks after an initial visit for care for LBP versus  similar  patients who did not undergo early  \nimaging  [9].

Initial imaging.  \nA systematic review examining studies that used red flags  as an indication  for screening  found  that of all the red \nflags,  only a history  of cancer  has been  shown  to increase  the probability  of finding spinal  malignancy  [61]. In a \npatient  suspected  of having cancer,  MRI without  and with IV contrast  is considered  superior  in evaluation  of \nlocalizing  disease (intramedullary, intradural -extramedullary,  and extradural)  as well as assessing  extent  of the \nlesion.  For malignant/metastatic  disease,  both bony/marrow  involvement  and neural  compression  from  epidural  \ntumor  are visualized  with high spatial  resolution  [62]. Although CT lumbar  spine  without  IV contrast  can be \nperformed  to evaluate osseous  integrity  (eg, pathologic  fracture)  when  involved with tumor,  intradural  and spinal  \ncord pathologies  are poorly  depicted  on CT. Bone  scan remains invaluable  when  a survey  of the entire  skeleton  is \nindicated  (eg, for metastatic disease) ; however , MRI offers  greater  specificity  than bone  scan,  with comparable  \nsensitivity  and the added  advantage  of providing  anatomic detail  [63]. Although  osseous destruction , as well as \nidentifying  lytic or sclerotic lesions can be detected  on radiography,  at least half of the bone must  be eroded  before  \nthere is a noticeable change on radiographs  [64]. Whole -body  FDG-PET/CT  is typically  not an initial imaging  study  \nbut can be used to evaluate for widespread  metastatic disease and can distinguish  benign versus malignant  \ncompression  fractures [65,66] . \nIn a patient  with suspected  spinal  infection, MRI without  and with IV contrast  is preferred  because of its  high \nsensitivity  and specificity.  MRI can localize the site of infection  and assess the extent  of extradural/epidural  and \nparavertebral  involvement.  The addition  of IV contrast  with fat suppression  is invaluable  in identifying  epidural  \nand paraspinal  abscess [65] and helps  distinguish  abscess from  phlegmon [67].

Kransdorf, MD.q \nSummary of Literature Review  \nBackground/Introduction \nChronic knee pain affects tens of millions of people  in the United States annually , with the pain sometimes highly \ndisabling and often negatively impacting the patient\u2019s quality of life. Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and \nit can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain \nwith the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. \nTypically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain \npersists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  \nimaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated \nthat approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the \nprior year) radiographs [2 ]. \nThis document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  \u22655 years of age.  The \nvariants discussed include: (1) initial exam ination ; (2) initial radiograph is normal or demonstrates a joint \neffusion; (3) initial radiogr aph demonstrates osteochondritis dissecans (OCD), loose bodies or history of cartilage,  \nor meniscal repair; (4) initial radiograph demonstrates osteoarthritis or chondrocalcinosis; and (5)  initial \nradiograph demonstrates signs of prior (chronic) knee injur y (ie, Segond fract ure, tibial spine avulsion, etc ).  \nTo evaluat e knee pain associated with other conditions, please refer to the following ACR Appropriateness \nCriteria\u00ae topic on:  \u201cOsteonecrosi s of the Hip \u201d [3] for osteonecrosis,  \u201cAcute Trauma to the Knee \u201d for acute knee \ninjuries  [4], \u201cImaging After Total Knee Arthroplasty \u201d for patients with total knee arthroplasty  [5], \u201cSoft-Tissue \nMasses \u201d for a patient with a suspected soft -tissue mass [6], \u201cPrimary Bone Tumors \u201d for a patient with a suspected \nor known bone tumor [ 7], and \u201c Chronic Extremity Joint Pain -Suspected Inflammatory Arthritis \u201d for patient with \nsuspected arthritis  or synovitis [ 8]. \nSpecial Imaging  Considerations  \nKnee radiographs  should include at least one frontal projection of one or both knees (anteroposterior, Rosenberg, \nor tunnel), a tangential patellar view , and a lateral view of the affected knee [2,9]. Standing radiographs more \naccurately reflect medial and lateral compartment cartilage loss than supine radiographs with the posteromedial and posterolateral joint compartments  more accurately assessed using a weight -bearing flexion posteroanterior \nradiograph [9,10]. \nDiscussion of Pro cedures by Variant  \nVariant 1:  Adult or child greater than or equal to 5  year s of age .

CT kne e without IV contrast may also be useful to \nconfirm a prior osseous injury.  \nCT with IV contrast is not usually indicated to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  \nCT without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated to eva luate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous \nknee injury.  \nCT Arthrography  Knee  \nCT arthrography may be used to evaluate the menisci, articular cartilage, and the presence of loose bodies with \nreported sensitivities and specificities ranging from 86 % to 100%  [16,62-64 ]. \nMRI Knee  \nMRI without IV contrast may be indicated when radiographs demonstrate a small osseous fragment along the \nmedial patellar margin or if there is a clinical concern for prior or chronic patellar dislocation -relocation.  MRI can \nassess the integrity of the medial patellofemoral ligament and medial patellar retinaculum, define the extent of \ncartilage injury, and identify loose bodies [41].  MRI is useful for evaluating Osgood-Schlatter or Sinding -Larsen -\nJohansson syndrome [41].  If the radiograph suggests prior anterior cruciate ligament  injury, MRI can effectively \nevaluate the menisci , but evaluation for associated cartilage lesions is less useful [65].  \nMRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) \nosseous knee injury.  \nMR Arthrography  Knee  \nMR arthrography is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with s igns of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  \nUS Knee  \nUS is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  \nBone Scan Knee  \nRadionuclide bone scan is usually not indicated to evaluate patients with signs of prior  (chronic) osseous knee \ninjury.  \nImage -Guided Aspiration Knee  \nJoint aspiration is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  \nSummary of Recommendations  \n\u2022 Variant 1:  Radiographs  of the knee  are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of  chronic knee pain in \npatients greater than or equal to 5 years of age.  \n\u2022 Variant 2:  MRI knee without  IV contrast is usually appropriate in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of \nage with chronic knee pain when initial knee  radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion.  \n\u2022 Variant 3:  MRI knee without  IV contrast is usually appropriate  in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of \nage with chronic knee pain when initial knee radiographs demonstrate OCD,  loose bodies, or history of \ncartilage or meniscal repair.  \n\u2022 Variant 4:  (1) MRI knee without IV contrast  or (2)  knee aspiration or (3)  CT knee without  IV contrast may \nbe appropriate  in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of age with chronic knee pain when initial \nradiographs de monstrate degenerative changes or chondrocalcinosis.

Kransdorf, MD.p \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nTraumatic shoulder pain is shoulder pain believed to be directly attributed to a traumatic event, either acute or \nchronic. This pain may be the result of either fracture (the clavicle, scapula, or proximal humerus) or soft -tissue \ninjury (most commonly of the rotator cuff, acromioclavicular ligaments, or labroligamentous complex). The \nincidence of traumatic shoulder injuries is difficult to determine because some injury types, such as low-grade \nacromioclavicular separations or acute rotator cuff tears, are likely under -reported because patients  do not seek \nimmediate medical treatment. However, as with many traumatic injuries, traumatic shoulder pain tends to \ndisproportionately involve young adults and male patients [ 1,2]. \nThe etiology of traumatic shoulder pain can often be made based on clinical examination, radiographs, and \nmechanism of injury. Traumatic shoulder injuries can generally be separated into in juries requiring acute surgical \nmanagement and injuries in which conservative management can be attempted prior to considering surgical \ntreatment. Unstable or significantly displaced fractures and joint instability are injuries most likely requiring acute \nsurgical treatment. Most soft -tissue injuries (such as labral tears and rotator cuff tears) can undergo a period of \nconservative management prior to considering surgery. However, in addition to the specific imaging findings \nrelated to a traumatic injury, indications and timing of surgical treatment of many traumatic shoulder injuries are \ndependent on patient age, comorbidities, current activity level, and expected activity level.  \nImaging of chronic shoulder pain is beyond the scope of this topic  and is cove red in the  ACR Appropriateness \nCriteria\u00ae on \u201cShoulder Pain\u2013 Atraumatic \u201d [3]. \nDiscussion o f Procedures  by Variant  \nVariant 1:  Traumatic shoulder pain.

They can delineate \nshoulder malalignment and most shoulder fractures [ 4,5]. A standard set of shoulder radiographs for trauma \nshould include at least three  views: anterior -posterior (AP) views in internal and external rotation and an axillary \nor scapula-Y view. Axillary or scapula-Y views are vital in evaluating traumatic shoulder injuries as \nacromioclavicular and glenohumeral dislocations can be misclassified on AP  views [6,7]. Radiographs provide \ngood delineation of bony anatomy to assess for fracture and appropriate shoulder alignment, which are the two \nprimary concerns in management of acute traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs should also be performed upright \nsince malalignment of the shoul der can be under -represented on supine radiographs [ 4]. Additional views, such as \nthe Bernageau view, have been sho wn to be effective in demonstrating the degree of bone loss of the glenoid or \nhumeral head [ 8]. \nCT Shoulder  \nComputed tomography ( CT) is better able than radiogr aphs to characteriz e fracture patterns [ 9-11].", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 8 Shoulder Pain \u2013Traumatic  Variant 2: Traumatic shoulder pain.

In the setting of normal shoulder radiographs, the most common causes \nof post -traumatic shoulder pain are soft -tissue injuries such  as rotator cuff and labral tears.  \nMRI Shoulder  \nNoncontrast MRI is a reasonable imaging study in the setting of acute nonlocalized traumatic shoulder pain and \nnoncontributory radiographs. In the acute trauma setting, noncontrast MRI may be preferred to MR arthrography , \nas acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint effusion for assessment of intra -articular \nsoft-tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic \npathology such as capsular and ligament tears [34,35]. MRI is also sensitive for diagnosing bone marrow \ncontusion and has  been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries in pediatric patients [ 36,37]. \nMR Arthrography  Shoulder  \nMR arthrography has been found to be superior to noncontrast MRI in the diagnosis of labroligamentous and \npartial -thickness rotator cuff tears [17,19]. In the acute trauma setting, however, noncontrast MRI may be \npreferred to MR arthrography because acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint \neffusion for assessment of intra-arti cular soft -tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing \nextra-articular soft -tissue traumatic pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [ 34,35]. MRI is also sensitive \nfor diagnosing bone marrow contusion and has been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries \nin pediatric patients [ 36,37]. \nUS Shoulder  \nUS has limited usefulness in patients with traumatic shoulder pain that cannot be localized to the rotator cuff or \nbiceps tendon. I n the post -traumatic setting, US has been shown to detect abnormalities, including proximal \nhumeral fractures [25]; however, recent studies on US performed for non specific shoulder pain have had \nconflicting results. US  for persistent shoulder pain after trauma has been found to diagnose significant pathology, \nprimarily fractures and rotator cuff tears, in 90% of patients [ 25]. However, 40% of patients presenting with \nnonspecific shoulder pain were found to have no significant pathology on US [38]. Additionally,  US has been \ndemonstrated to be inferior to MRI in assessment of labroligamentous, osseous, and rotator cuff pathology [ 17]. \nUS can b e considered as a screening tool in patients with persistent nonspecific shoulder pain after trauma, \nparticularly in an older patient population in whom rotator cuff tears are more common.

Younger patients are more likely to \nhave labroligamentous injury and persistent instability after dislocation compared with older patients [54]. Older \npatients are more likely to have rotator cuff tears in association with shoulder dislocation [ 55]. Coexisting \nhumeral avulsion of the glenohumeral ligament and significant glenoid bone loss have been found in up to 10% of \npatients with recurrent shoulder instability [ 56], which underscores the need to assess both osseous and \nlabroligamentous pathology in patients with shoulder dislocation or instability.

Initial imaging.  \nThe body  regions  covered  in this clinical  scenario  include  the neck,  chest,  abdomen,  pelvis,  humerus/upper  arm, \nshoulder, elbow,  forearm,  wrist,  hand,  hip, femur/thigh, knee,  tibia/lower  leg, ankle,  and foot. \nRadiography Area  of Interest  \nInitial imaging  assessment  of a suspected  musculoskeletal  soft tissue mass  should almost  invariably  begin with \nradiographic  evaluation  and is advocated  by the European Society  for Medical  Oncology\u2013 European Reference  \nNetwork  Clinical Practice  Guidelines  for rare adult  solid  cancers (ESMO -EURACAN)  [9]. Although often  \nconsidered  unrewarding  by clinicians  without  musculoskeletal  expertise,  a study of the radiogra phic evaluation  of \n454 patients  with proven  soft tissue masses demonstrated  positive  results in 62% of cases,  with calcification  \nidentified  in 27% of cases,  bone  involvement  in 22% of cases,  and intrinsic  fat in 11% of cases [10]. Specifically,  \nradiographic  findings  can be diagnostic  or highly  character istic,  such as in the identification  of phleboliths  within  a \nhemangioma,  the osteocartilaginous  masses  of synovial  chondromatosis,  or the peripherally  more  mature  \nossification  of myositis  ossificans,  to name  just a few. In addition, radiographs  can be diagnostic  of an unsuspected  \nskeletal  abnormality  or deformity  that may manifest  as a soft tissue mass.  Even  when  a specific diagnosis  cannot  \nbe provided,  radiographs  may reveal  information  on the type and scope of mineralization, the presence or absence  \nof unsuspected  foreign  matter,  or changes  within  the adjacent  bone.  In general,  radiographic  findings  related  to a \nsoft tissue mass  can provide  helpful  insight  in determining  the next most  appropriate  imaging  modality  for further  \ncharacterization.  Of note,  radiographs  may not demonstrate an associated  abnormality  when  a mass  is small, deep -\nseated,  nonmineralized,  or in an area with complex  anatomy  such as the flank,  paraspinal  region,  groin,  or deep  soft \ntissues of the hands  and feet [11]. \nUS Area  of Interest  \nUltrasound  (US)  has become increasingly  recognized  as an excellent  triage  tool for evaluation  of superficial  soft \ntissue masses [12-15]. This recognition has been  further  supported by a recent  prospective  study of 219 \nhistologically  proven  masses that showed  US had a sensitivity, specificity, positive  predictive  value,  and negative  \npredictive  value  of 93.3%,  97.9%,  45.2%,  and 99.9%,  respectively , for discriminating  benign  from  malignant  \ntumors  in the superficial  soft tissues [16]. The same group  of researchers had similar  results in an earlier  separate  \nretrospective analysis of 247 histologically  proven  masses [17]. However,  although these results highlight  the \nbenefits of US in the initial assessment  of superficial  masses,  the overall  number  of malignancies in both the \nprospective  [16] and retrospective [17] studies was very small  (12 patients  and 11 patients,  respectively).  Another  \nrecent  study of 42 histologically  proven masses concluded that MRI performed  after US does not frequently change  \nthe working diagnosis  or add diagnostic  value,  but again , this study only included  a small  number  of malignancies \nand the value  of MRI for these malignancies was not separately  addressed  in the study  [18].", "ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 5 Soft Tissue  Masses CT Area of Interest  Without  and With  IV Contrast  \nCT does not typically  play a role in the initial evaluation  of a superficial  soft tissue mass.  \nCT Area of Interest  Without  IV Contrast  \nCT does not typically  play a role in the initial evaluation  of a superficial soft tissue mass.  \nFDG -PET/CT  Area  of Interest  \nThere is insufficient  literature  to support  the routine  use of fluorine -18-2 -fluoro -2-deoxy-D -glucose (FDG )-PET/CT  \nfor the initial evaluation  of a soft tissue mass.  \nImage -Guided Biopsy  Area  of Interest  \nThe l iterature  does not support  the use of image -guided biopsy as the initial examination  for a soft tissue mass.  At \nleast 20% to 25% of soft tissue masses can demonstrate features that allow  for confident  diagnosis  based  on MRI \nalone  [23], many  of which  are benign and thus would not warrant  biopsy.

Radiographs  remain  the modality  best suited  \nfor the initial assessment  of a suspected  soft tissue mass  and are the initial study  of choice for orthopedic  oncologists  \n[25,26] . However,  radiographs  have  limitations  and may not reveal  an abnormality  when  a mass is small, deep -\nseated,  nonmineralized,  or in an area with complex  anatomy  such as the flank,  paraspinal  region,  groin,  or deep  soft \ntissues of the hands  and feet [11]. \nUS Area  of Interest  \nThe diagnostic  accuracy  of US is considerably  less when  lesions outside  the subcutaneous tissue are included.  It is \nalso less reliable  for defining deep  masses in large anatomical  areas [27]. Although a recent  prospective  study of \nUS accuracy  in the characterization  of 134 histologically  proven  deep  soft tissue masses showed  promising results,  \nthere were only a small  number  of malignancies in the study cohort , and the investigators  had a high level  of US \nexpertise [28]. Therefore,  US is most appropriate  for superficial  masses that are small  (<5 cm) in size [13] but may \nbe appropriate for deep soft tissue masses in specific settings, such as a deep mass in a thin patient .", "ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 9 Soft Tissue  Masses thus would not warrant  biopsy.

Therefore,  the use \nof US for the final evaluation  and staging  of a deep  soft tissue mass  is not recommended.  \nVariant  4: Soft tissue mass.  Nondiagnostic  radiograph and noncontrast -enhanced  ultrasound.  MRI  \ncontraindicated. Next  imaging  study.  \nThe body regions covered in this clinical scenario include the neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, humerus/upper arm, \nshoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist, hand, hip, femur/thigh, knee, tibia/lower leg, ankle, and foot.  \nCT Area  of Interest  With  IV Contrast  \nCT has become a useful  technique  for the evaluation  of patients  who cannot  undergo MRI and is the modality  of \nchoice in this scenario  [29]. In the evaluation  of suspected  tumors,  contrast  imaging  is especially  useful  in \ndistinguishing vascularized  from  potentially  necrotic regions  of the tumor.  With  modern  CT technology,  \ncalcification  can usually  be distinguished from  vascular  enhancement.  \nOf note, d ual-energy  CT is a relatively  newer  technology that has shown  utility  in evaluation  of soft tissue masses.  \nUsing  the differences in energy  attenuation  of soft tissue at 80 kVp and 140 kVp,  this technique  can allow  \nreconstruction  of virtual noncontrast  CT images as well as significantly  reduce metal  artifact  in the assessment  of \nmetal  implants,  improving the diagnostic  value  of imaging  in the surrounding soft tissues [49,50] . It has also shown  \napplication  in the assessment  of marrow  edema [51,52]  and has been  investigated  in the distinction  of marrow  \nedema from  intramedullary  tumor  invasion [53]. Furthermore,  spectral  CT is emerging  as a useful  tool for \ndistinguishing benign from  malignant  soft tissue masses [54]. \nCT Area  of Interest  Without and With  IV Contrast  \nDual-phase CT without  and with IV contrast  as the next imaging  study for the evaluation  of a soft tissue mass  may \nbe appropriate when MRI is con traindicated . Although single -phase CT with IV contrast is considered most \nappropriate in this clinical scenario given the advent of virtual noncontrast reconstruction with modern dual -source \nCT scanners [31] , a traditional CT without and with  IV contrast can be helpful  for characterization of mineralization \nin an anatomically complex area.  \nCT Area  of Interest  Without IV Contrast  \nThe l iterature  does not support  the use of a single -phase CT without  IV contrast  as the next imaging  study  for the \nevaluation  of a soft tissue mass  when  MRI is contraindicated.  However,  single -phase CT with IV contrast  is a useful  \ntechnique  for the evaluation  of patients  who cannot  undergo  MRI and is the modality  of choice  in this scenario  [29]. \nIn the evaluation  of suspected  tumors,  contrast  imaging  is especially  useful  in distinguishing  vascularized  from  \npotentially  necrotic regions  of the tumor.  With  modern CT techno logy,  calcification  can usually  be distinguished  \nfrom  vascular  enhancement.  Therefore,  CT without  IV contrast  is usually  not beneficial ."], ["ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 4 Chronic Foot Pain  Discussion of Procedures by Variant  \nVariant 1: Chronic foot pain.

Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral \nand oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar \ncoalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs \non the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition.

If radiographs  \nare negative,  MRI can be obtained in select  patients  with forefoot  pain because of its increased  sensitivity  for the \nearly  detection  of metatarsal  head  subchondral  fracture  [54]. \nLisfranc  Injury  \nMRI has been  advocated  as a sensitive diagnostic  test in evaluation  of Lisfranc ligamentous  complex  (especially  \nif the patient  is not able to bear weight),  and 3-D volumetric  acquisitions  have  proven superiority  over orthogonal  \nproton  density  fat-suppressed  imaging [33,38,41- 45].

Both  MRI and US have  been  shown  to be sensitive  for the diagnosis  of acute tendon  \nrupture  or dislocation  in the foot [39].

On initial diagnosis, MRI can be used to  predict t ime to return to play in athletes. \nFredericson et al  [48] retrospectively correlated return to activity with an MRI grading system based on the \npattern of periosteal and marrow edema on T1-weighted  and fat -suppressed T 2-weighted sequences. Similar \nfindings were confirmed in other studies  [49-51] , including  that the finding of abnormal cortical signal intensity \nor a fracture line was of prognostic value [ 51] and that MRI performed better in predicting return to activity than \nradiographs , bone scintigraphy, or CT [50,52]. \nA recent prospective study in university athletes found that MRI grading s everity, total-body bone mineral density \nevaluated by dual -energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and location of injury (ie , cortical or trabecular bone)  \nwere important variables for predicting time to full return to sport [ 31]. In this study, periosteal edema as \ndescribed by Fredericson et al [ 48] was not associated with return to sport . Using the modified grading scale and a \nmultiple regression model, for every 1- unit increase in MRI grade, the time to full return to sport increased by \napproximately 48 days [31] . Furthermore, trabecular st ress injuries (eg , femur neck and pubic bone ) were \nassociated with a longer time to return to sport than cortical bone stress injuries. In addition, decreased bone \nmineral density leads to increased time to return to sport . Therefore, bone mineral density provides additional \ndiagnostic and prognostic information [31]. The model of MRI  grade, trabecular versus cortical bone sit e, and \ntotal-body bone mineral density a ccounted for 68% of the variation in time to return to sport [ 31]. Although \nfurther studies are needed, optimization of bone mass may reduce risk of sustaining str ess injuries or possibly \nreduce recovery time i n athletes with these injuries.  \nIt should be noted that after a diagnosis of stress fracture is made, no additional imaging is typically performed. \nPatients are typically followed clinically until they are pain  free, at which time they can  increase activity in a \ncontrolled manner  [53]. \nVariant 6 : Suspected stress (in sufficiency) fracture , pelvis or hip. First imaging study.  \nSee variant 1.  Pelvic and hip insufficiency fractures have varied presentations and often insidious onset. Patients \nfrequently present with intractable lower back or pelvic pain, with loss of mobil ity and independence  and \nsymptom exacerbation with weight bearing [54]. Insufficiency fractures occur in patients with abnormal bone , be \nit from osteoporosis, irradiated bone, or resumpt ion of activity postarthropl asty as typical examples. Insufficiency \nfractures also occur at fairly predictable sites, including the sacrum , supra -acetabular ilium, superior and inferior \npubic rami,  and pubic bone . Radiographs should be the initial imaging modality in patients with low back and/or \npelvic pain. Anterior -posterior ( AP) and lateral lumbar spine and AP pelvis radiographs are usually obtained. \nBecause of  overlying bowel gas, fecal material, vascular calcifications, sacral curvature, and/or copious soft \ntissue, the sensitivity of radiographs is low  [55]. Radiographs may be more likely to be negative initially in older \nor osteoporotic patients with insuffi ciency fractures, particularly when they occur in the pelvis or sacrum  where \nthere is more overlapping soft tissue [ 17]. However, if the findings are conclusive for insufficiency fracture, no \nfurther imaging need be performed.  \nVariant 7 : Suspected stress (insufficiency) fracture, pelvis or hip.

Detection of osseous change is more limited in areas covered by prominent overlapping soft tissue [17]. If the \nosseous reaction involve s cortical bone, then endosteal/periosteal callus may be visible with or without a fracture \nline through the cortex. If the trabecular bone is involved, then stress fractures are often more  subtle, progressing \nfrom patchy areas of increased density into linear areas of sclerosis, oriented perpendicular to the trabeculae.  \nAlthough bone scans were regarded as the gold-standard examination for many years, MRI is extremely sensitive \nand demonstrates stress abnormalities as early as bone scintigraphy  and with as much sensitivity  [11-14] . The \nrecent literature favors MRI as the procedure of choice for making an early diagnosis of both varieties of stress \nfractures [15-28]. In this regard, MRI outperforms radiography,  bone scintigraphy, and CT. Furthermore, MRI \nexamination of an osseous stress injury contains  prognostic as well as diagnostic information  [30,31]. \nCT is not typically used as a first - or second -line imaging tool  but may offer an adjunctive role when other \nimaging modalities are equivocal  [23]. Although  superior to radiography, it is less sensitive than nuclear \nscintigraphy and MRI  [19]. \nStress fractures in the femur most often occur in the femoral neck and represent up to 7% of all stress fractures  \n[39]. Lateral \u201ctension -type \u201d femoral neck stress fractures are inherently unstable and prone to displacement  [40] \nand are high-risk fractures, often necessitating percutaneous screw fixation  [41]. Medial \u201ccompression -type \u201d \nfemoral n eck stress fractures are low risk [40] and can be treated with a non\u2013 weight -bearing  regimen  [42]. \nFinally, stress fractures of the femoral head are high  risk in healthy patients and , if not recognized promptly, have \nincreased  rates of delayed union, nonunion, displacement, and avascular necrosis [17]. Given the importance of \nrecognizing these high-risk fractures in the femoral head and neck, MRI is the preferred second -line study after  \ninitial negative  radiographs to prevent delayed diagnosis.  \nVariant 3: Suspected stress (fatigue) fracture, excluding hip  and vertebrae. Negative radiographs. Next \nimaging study.  \nSee variant 2. Certain stress fractures are considered high  risk based on a tendency for nonunion or delayed union. \nHigh -risk stress fractures include the anterior tibial diaphysis, lateral femoral neck and femoral head (see variant \n2), patella, medial malleolus, navicular, fifth metatarsal base, proximal second metatarsal, tibial hallux sesamoid, \nand talus  [43]. \nThe second -line test to diagnose a stress fracture should be guided by the location of the patient \u2019s pain and \nlikelihood of high-risk injury. A follow -up radiographic examination has increased sensitivity compared to initial \nradiographs [8] but is less sensitive than MRI. MRI is extremely sensitive and demonstrates stress abnormalities \nas early as bone scintigraphy and with as much sensitivity [ 11-14]. The recent literature favors MRI as the \nprocedure of choice for making an early diagnosis of both varieties of stress fractures [ 15-28 ]. MRI is also \nconsiderably more specifi c than bone scintigraphy [ 19,23]. Stress injuries in athletes that are not identified and \nmanaged in a timel y fashion can progress to more serious fractures. Preventive strategies, including identifying \nand modifying risk factors, may help deter progression to frank fractures [31,44,45]. \nA circumstance that deserves specific attention is the longitudinal stress fracture, particularly in the tibia. Up to \n25% may appear n ormal on radiographs, but CT or MRI findings are characteristic [ 13,46]. MRI is very sensitive \nto the bone marrow e dema accompanying these longitudinal fractures and may give a misleadingly aggressive \nappearance [38].", "Correlat ion of  clinical history, pattern , and site recognition \nwith radiographic findings  is usually specific [1,2,4,5,7]. Nevertheless, stress fractures are frequently occult on \ninitial radiographs  [1], with conventional radiographs having a sensitivity of 15% to 35% [8]. Early radiographic \nfindings are often nonspecific (subtle periosteal reaction , gray cortex sign) or even nonexistent. Late radiographic \nfindings are often suggestive in appearance  and include  linear sclerosis (often perpe ndicular to the major \ntrabecular lines), periosteal reaction , patchy endosteal sclerosis, and soft -tissue swelling . Additionally, \nradiographs may remain negative depending on the timing of re imaging , the patient\u2019s metabolic bone status, and \nthe type and lo cation of the fracture. Thus, radiographs are specific but significantly insensitive. Despite this \nlimitation, all authorities agree that radiographs should be the initial imaging modality; if the findings are \nconclusive, no further imaging need be perform ed. \nVariant 2: S uspected stress (fatigue) fracture, hip.

Neuropathic  osteoarthropathy  is a \nprogressive  process affecting  the bones,  joints , and soft tissue of the foot and ankle.  Delay  in the diagnosis  may \nlead to derangement  of the bony architecture of the foot, deformity,  recurrent  foot ulcerations,  cellulitis,  \nosteomyelitis , and amputation [4]. \nImaging findings  should not be interpreted  in isolation. Clinical  features that suggest  osteomyelitis  include  an \nulcer  area >2 cm\u00b2, an elevated  erythrocyte  sedimentation  rate level  of >70 mm/hour,  positive probe -to-bone  test, a \nnonhealing  ulcer  for 6 months,  erythema,  fever,  and elevated  white blood cell (WBC) count  [2,5,6]. A negative  \nprobe -to-bone  test may exclude  the diagnosis  of osteomyelitis  with a high negative  predictive  value  [7]. The \nInfectious  Diseases Society  of American  recommends performing  the probe -to-bone  test on any diabetic  foot \ninfection  with an open wound [8]. Deep  wound cultures correlate well with osseous cultures and provide  a \nsensitive method in assessing  and targeting  likely  pathogens  that cause osseous infections  [9]. \nFor the diabetic  foot with a clinical  examination  suggesting crepitus where soft-tissue gas associated  with wet \ngangrene  is suspected,  please see the ACR  Appropria teness  Criteria\u00ae topic  on Suspected  Osteomyelitis,  Septic  \nArthritis, or Soft Tissue Infection  (Excluding  Spine  and Diabetic Foot)  for appropriate  guidance  [10]. \nDiscussion  of Procedures  by Variant  \nVariant  1: Suspected  osteomyelitis of the foot in patients  with  diabetes  mellitus.

Ac ute thoracic or lumbar spine injury detected on \nradiographs or noncontrast CT. Neurologic abnormalities. Next imaging study. \nCT Myelography Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nCT myelography can be performed to assess for traumatic spinal canal narrowing that is due to disc herniation or \nepidural hematoma and to assess for preganglionic nerve root avulsions. Ho wever, as with conventional CT, CT \nmyelography is inferior to MRI in assessing cord contus ion, cord hemorrhage, and postganglionic nerve root \ninjuries [40,41,43,57]. Performance of thoracolumbar CT myelogram can also be technically challenging, \nparticularly in patients with suspected  unstable thoracolumbar spine injury. \nCT Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nCT does play a role in the initial assessment of thoracic and lumbar spine injury. However, CT is significantly \ninferior to MRI in identifying many soft-tissue pathologies,  such as cord contusion, epidural hematoma, and nerve \nroot avulsions that can cause neurologic deficits re quiring surgical intervention [40,41,43,57]. Therefore, CT \nshould not be considered adequate for excluding signifi cant soft-tissue pathology in patients presenting with \nthoracolumbar spine trauma and neurologic deficit. \nMRI Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nMRI should be performed in patients who have possible spinal  cord injury, in whom there is clinical concern for \ncord compression that is due to disc protrusion or hema toma, and in those suspected of ligamentous instability. \nMRI is valuable for characterizing the cause of myelopathy in  patients with spinal cord  injury. The severity of the \ninjury\u2014including extent of intramedullary hemorrhage , length of edema, and evidence of cord transection\u2014\ncontributes to predicting outcome. Compression of the cord  by disc herniation, bone fragments, and hematomas is \nbest displayed on MRI, and MRI may be used to guide su rgical interventions [41,43]. For these reasons, the MRI \nexamination should include T2-weighted images as well as gradient-echo images. In the subacute and chronic \nstages after cord trauma, MRI can help define the extent of  cord injury. This is particularly important in patients \nwho suffer late deterioration, which is sometimes cau sed by treatable etiologies like the development or \nenlargement of intramedullary cavities,  such as a post-traumatic syringomyelia. \nAlthough numerous research studies ha ve reported a potential value of diffusion MRI for characterizing spinal \ncord injury [111], technical problems have prevented wid espread application of this technique to human studies. \nThe current utility of diffusion MRI for assessing cord trauma remains unknown. \nSummary of Recommendations \n\uf0b7 Variant 1: Imaging is not recommended for the initial imaging of patients \u226516 years of age and <65 years of \nage with suspected acute blunt cervi cal spine trauma when imaging is  not indicated by NEXUS or CCR \nclinical criteria and the patient meets low-risk criteria. \n\uf0b7 Variant 2: CT cervical spine without IV contrast is usually  appropriate for the initial imaging of patients \u226516 \nyears of age with suspected acute blunt trauma of the cervical spine when imaging is indicated by NEXUS or \nCCR clinical criteria. \n\uf0b7 Variant 3: MRI cervical spine without IV contrast is usua lly appropriate as the next imaging study for \npatients \u226516 years of age with suspected acute blunt trauma of the cervical spine and confirmed or suspected \ncervical spinal cord or nerve root injury, with or  without traumatic injury identified on cervical CT. \n\uf0b7 Variant 4: CT cervical spine without IV contrast and MRI cervical spine without IV contrast are usually \nappropriate for patients \u226516 years of age with acute cervical spine injury detected on radiographs and \ntreatment planning for mechanically unstable spine.

Blunt trauma meeting criteria for thoracic and lumbar \nimaging. Initial imaging. \nImaging is a crucial component in assessment of thoracic and lumbar spine injury. Fr om 1998 to 2011, there was \nan adjusted annual increase of approximately 8% in thor acolumbar spine fractures in patients involved in motor \nvehicle collisions [15]. Thoracolumbar fractures are cha llenging to identify clinically, with only 48% to 75% of \nthoracolumbar injuries identified on clinical examination [16-18]. Unlike cervical injuries, well-defined clinical \ncriteria have not been established to determine when thor acolumbar imaging is appropriate in the setting of blunt \ntraumatic injury. Since clinical examination has poor sen sitivity for identifying thoracolumbar injuries, any high-\nrisk patient (mid line thoracolumbar tenderness, high-energ y mechanism of injury, or >60 years of age), as well as \nunexaminable patients (intoxicated, GCS <15, distracting injury), should undergo imaging of the thoracolumbar \nspine. Screening of the entire spine is advised, as an es timated 20% of spine injuries will have a second associated \nspinal injury at a noncontiguous level [26,27]. \nRadiography  Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nIt is well established that CT outperforms radiographs in  the diagnosis of thoracolumbar spine fractures [104-\n108]. Radiographs have a reported sens itivity of 49% to 62% for identifying thoracic spine fractures and 67% to \n82% sensitivity for identifying lumbar spine fractures [ 104,107,108] compared with the reported sensitivity of \n94% to 100% for identifying thoracolumbar spine fract ures using CT [104,107,108]. However, the clinical \nsignificance of fractures missed on radiographs is uncertain . If screening of the thoracolumbar spine is performed \nusing radiographs, imaging should consis t of anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the thoracic and lumbar \nspine with additional \u201cswimmer\u2019s lateral\u201d view of the upper thoracic spine if this region is obscured by the \noverlying shoulders. \nCT Myelography Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nThere is no role for CT myelography in the in itial assessment of thoraco lumbar spine injury. \nCT Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nCT is the gold standard for identifying fractures of the t horacolumbar spine with a reported sensitivity of 94% to \n100% [104,107-110]. In addition to identifying thoracolumbar spine injuri es, CT is excellent for delineating soft-\ntissue injuries of the chest, abdomen, and pelvic regi on that often accompany spinal fractures. However, CT \nimaging of the thoracolumbar spine is more commonly pe rformed as part of CT evaluation of the entire thorax, \nabdomen, and pelvis in trauma patients with high index of suspicion for soft-tissue injuries or who cannot be \ncleared by clinical examination. It is debated whethe r dedicated reformatted images using collimated field-of-\nviews centered on the thoracolumbar spine with dedicated  \u201chard kernel\u201d image algorithms are more accurate for \nidentifying bony pathology. Recent studi es indicate that identification of thoracolumbar spine fractures on routine \nthoracic, abdomen, and pelvic CT imaging using routine body large fields of view and \u201csoft kernel\u201d image \nalgorithms is comparable to dedicated thoracolumbar spine reformatted images. Se nsitivity of thoracolumbar \nspine fracture detection using routine body imaging prot ocols has been reported at 94% to 99% compared with \n97% to 99% sensitivity using dedicated thoracolumbar spin e protocols with no statistically significant difference \nin sensitivity between the two protocols [109,110].", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 14 Suspected Spine Trauma patients with ligament injury identified on MRI had an abnormality identified on flex ion-extension radiographs. \nFurthermore, flexion-extension radiographs carry  the real danger of producing neurologic injury. \nCT Myelography Cervical Spine \nThere is no role for myelography in assessment of an obt unded patient without traumatic injury identified on CT \nin the absence of physical examination signs  of spinal cord or nerve root injury. \nCTA Head and Neck \nPatients presenting with a neurologic abnormality that is unexplained by a diagnosed cervical spine injury should \nbe evaluated for blunt cerebrovascular injury [65]. \nMRI Cervical Spine \nThe utilization of MRI in obtunded trauma patients is contr oversial.

Corey, MD.v \nSummary  of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nIn the United  States,  acute low back  pain (LBP),  with or without radiculopathy , is the leading  cause of years lived  \nwith disability  and the third  ranking cause of disability -adjusted  life years  [1]. It is the fifth most  common  reason  \nfor a physician  visit in the United  States  and accounts for approximately  3% of visits  to the emergency  department  \n[2]. \nThe American  College  of Physicians and the American  Pain Society  classify  LBP into the following  broad  \ncategories:  nonspecific LBP, back  pain potentially  associated  with radiculopathy or spinal  stenosis,  and back  pain \npotentially  associated  with another  specific spinal  cause [3]. Additionally,  guidelines  from  the American  College  \nof Physicians and the American  Pain Society  [3,4]  emphasize a focused  history  and physical  examination,  \nreassurance,  initial pain management  medications if necessary,  and consideration  of physical  therapies without  \nroutine  imaging  in patients  with nonspecific  LBP. Duration  of symptoms  also helps  guide  treatment  algorithms  in \npatients  with acute,  subacute,  or chronic  LBP. Additionally, assessment  of psychosocial  risk factors when  obtaining  \npatient  history  is a strong predictor  of patients  who are predisposed  to developing chronic  disabling LBP problems  \n[3]. \nAlthough there  is great  variability  in the definition  of acute and subacute  LBP, for the purposes  of this guideline,  \nwe will use the Institute  for Clinical Systems  Improvement  definitions  of 0 to 4 weeks to define  acute LBP,  4 to 12 \nweeks for subacute LBP, and >12 weeks for chronic  LBP [5]. \nIt is clear  that uncomplicated  acute  LBP and/or  radiculopathy is a benign,  self-limited  condition  that does not \nwarrant  any imaging studies [4,6,7] . Imaging is considered  in those  patients who have  had up to 6 weeks of medical  \nmanagement  and physical  therapy  that resulted  in little or no improvement  in their back  pain.  It is also considered  \nfor those  patients  presenting  with red flags , raising  suspicion  for a serious underlying  condition,  such as cauda \nequina  syndrome  (CES),  malignancy,  fracture,  or infection  (see Table 1). \n \naUniversity of Utah Health, Salt Lake City, Utah. bResearch Author, University of Utah Medical Center, Salt Lake City, Utah. cPanel Chair, University of \nUtah, Salt Lake City, Utah. dPanel Vice- Chair, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Saint Louis, Missouri. eUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, \nPennsylvania. fThe Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio. gMontefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.", "One study found no \nstatistically  significant  difference in primary  outcome  after 1 year for patients  \u226565 years of age  who had spine  \nimaging  within  6 weeks after an initial visit for care for LBP versus  similar  patients who did not undergo early  \nimaging  [9].

However, an important age-related risk factor for spinal fracture presenting as LBP  is osteoporosis.  As \nbone mass decreases slowly over time, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age, and differs by sex, race, \nethnicity  [10], and comorbidities. In line with the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations for patients  \nages 65 and older being screened for osteoporosis, patients  >65 years of age may be considered at risk for \nosteoporotic fracture when presenting with LBP . \nAdditionally,  for those  patients without  neurologic  compromise  and who present  with minor  risk factors for cancer,  \ninflammatory  back  disease  (eg, ankylosing spondylitis), vertebral  compression  fracture,  or symptomatic  spinal  \nstenosis,  imaging  should be considered  after a trial of therapy  [4]. \nIn the majority  of patients, no specific pathology for LBP can be identified.

It is the fifth most  common  reason  \nfor a physician  visit in the United  States  and accounts for approximately  3% of visits  to the emergency  department  \n[2]. \nThe American  College  of Physicians and the American  Pain Society  classify  LBP into the following  broad  \ncategories:  nonspecific LBP, back  pain potentially  associated  with radiculopathy or spinal  stenosis,  and back  pain \npotentially  associated  with another  specific spinal  cause [3]. Additionally,  guidelines  from  the American  College  \nof Physicians and the American  Pain Society  [3,4]  emphasize a focused  history  and physical  examination,  \nreassurance,  initial pain management  medications if necessary,  and consideration  of physical  therapies without  \nroutine  imaging  in patients  with nonspecific  LBP. Duration  of symptoms  also helps  guide  treatment  algorithms  in \npatients  with acute,  subacute,  or chronic  LBP. Additionally, assessment  of psychosocial  risk factors when  obtaining  \npatient  history  is a strong predictor  of patients  who are predisposed  to developing chronic  disabling LBP problems  \n[3]. \nAlthough there  is great  variability  in the definition  of acute and subacute  LBP, for the purposes  of this guideline,  \nwe will use the Institute  for Clinical Systems  Improvement  definitions  of 0 to 4 weeks to define  acute LBP,  4 to 12 \nweeks for subacute LBP, and >12 weeks for chronic  LBP [5]. \nIt is clear  that uncomplicated  acute  LBP and/or  radiculopathy is a benign,  self-limited  condition  that does not \nwarrant  any imaging studies [4,6,7] .

Very  rarely,  patients  may \ndevelop hematomyelia and subsequently acute myelopathy because of an intrameduallary  AVM  or spinal  artery  \naneurysm  rupture  [29,30] . Acute ischemic myelopathy can also develop in the setting  of fibrocartilaginous  embolic  \ndisease [31].

Advanced imaging is usually performed to determine disease activity, guide management decisions, and prognosticate outcomes. In patients with RA, US  of the wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints can  show \ninflammation  as active synovitis. Identifying active synovitis with power Doppler assessment is a useful adjunct \nin making an early diagnosis of RA when a pati ent with early arthritis does not meet the 2010 criteria established \nby the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism [20]. The presence of \nsynovitis predicts progression of erosions [31 ] and erosions themselves [35]. US can also depict small bone \nerosions with high spatial resolution; h owever, US is less sensitive to erosions that occur on the radial or ulnar \nsides of the inner carpal bones because direct scanning of these regions is blocked, unlike the dorsal and volar \nbone surfaces. Furthermore, unlike MRI, US cannot show changes within the bone marrow, which are  the \nstrongest prognosticator s for disease progression in RA [27, 28,32-34].  In patients with established inflammatory \narthritis who are undergoing therapy, judging progression or reduction of synovitis may be more difficult with \nsequential US compared to sequential MRI.  \nMR Arthrography  Wrist  \nMR arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected inflammatory \narthritides. \nCT Wrist  \nWhile CT is more sensitive than radiographs for erosions, CT is not routinely used for the diagnosis and \nmanagement of patients with suspected inflammatory arthritides . \nCT Arthrography  Wrist  \nCT arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected inflammatory \narthritides. \nBone Scan  Wrist  \nBone scan does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients  with suspected inflammatory \narthritides. \nArthrography  Wrist  \nRadiographic arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected \ninflammatory arthritides. \nVariant 4: Chronic wrist pain.

However, generalizing from experience with septic arthrit is in other joints, joint \naspiration should not be delayed in order to obtain advanced imaging studies. In cases of suspected septic arthritis, \npercutaneous aspiration of the wrist is indicated, even when radiographs appear normal. Aspirates should be \nanalyzed by cell count, gram stain, and appropriate cultures. Microscopic crystal analysis should also be obtained \nif there is a possibility of gout, acute pseudogout, or hydroxyapatite deposition disease. Aspiration can be \nperformed without imaging guidance i f the joint is distended, but either fluoroscopy or US  may be useful if a \nspecific compartment is to be targeted.  \nMRI Wrist  \nThere may be a role for MRI with IV contrast enhancement in the staging of infections (for example, to delineate the location and extent of soft-tissue abscesses)  after aspiration has been performed.  Especially in chronic cases, \nMRI with IV contrast may be useful to identify a fluid collection or joint effusion to target  for aspiration.  \nHowever, MRI is usually not appropriate as the next study after radiographs for suspected wrist infections.  \nMR Arthrography  Wrist  \nMR arthrography is not routinely used to evaluate suspected wrist infection.", "In other patients, nonspecific radiologic findings (including those in the soft  tissues) combined with the history and physical examination may be \nsufficient for clinical diagnosis, or may suggest preferred secondary imaging studies.  \nMRI  \nMRI is no t routinely used in the initial evaluation of chronic wrist pain.", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 11 Chronic Wrist Pain  CT Wrist  \nWhile CT with IV contrast enhancement can depict abscesses, it is usually not appropriate  for evaluation of \nsuspected wrist infections.  \nCT Arthrography  Wrist  \nCT arthrography is not routinely used to eval uate suspected wrist infection.  \nUS Wrist  \nThere may be a role for US in the staging of infections (for example, to delineate the location and e xtent of soft -\ntissue abscesses) after aspiration has been performed.

Radiographs normal or nonspecific . Next study.  \nMRI Wrist  \nBoth traumatic and degenerative lesions of the TFCC can produce chronic, ulnar -sided wrist pain . MRI is highly \naccurate for lesions involving the radial (central) zone of the disc, especially with the use of high -resolution fast \nspin-echo or 3-D grad ient-recalled pulse sequences [36]. There is some evidence suggesting that MRI performed \nwith a 3.0 T system is even more accurate than MRI performed with a 1.5 T system for TFCC lesions [37], but \nthere are no studies comparing the accuracy of the two field s trengths in the same patients. The sensitivity for \ntears of the ulnar attachment of the disc and the peripheral attachments (the ulnocarpal ligaments) are only fair \nwith noncontrast -enhanced wrist MRI [ 12,36]. IV contrast seldom provides added benefit in patients with ulnar -\nsided wrist pain but may increase sensitivity for TFCC lesions if MR arthrography is desired but direct joint \ninjection is not feasible. \nMR Arthrography  Wrist  \nDirect MR arthrography (performed with contrast injection of the radiocarpal or distal radioulnar compartments, \nalone or in combination) does result in better diagnostic accuracy for the T FCC compared with conventional MRI, \nespecially for ulnar -sided lesions [26, 38], even when compared to conventio nal MRI performed with a 3.0 T \nmagnet [7,8,39]. The same is true for intrinsic ligament injuries, such as those of the lunotriquetral ligament, \nwhich can produce ulnar -sided pain [7 ,8,39]. Performing either MR arthrography or noncontrast -enhanced MRI is \nusually appropriate in this scenario.  \nCT Arthrography  Wrist  \nThe accuracy of CT arthrography is superior to MRI  and similar to that  of MR arthrography for TFCC and \nintrinsic ligament lesions [8,40]. In addition, CT arthrography appears to be mor e accurate than either MRI or  MR \narthrography for identifying articular cartilage defects in the wrist [38]. In contrast to MRI and MR arthrography, \nCT arthrography is less sensitive to lesions occurring outside of the joint (like abnormalities of the extensor carpi \nulnaris tendon) that can result in ulnar -sided pain.  For these reasons, CT arthrography may be appropriate in this \nsetting , especially if there is a contraindication to MRI or if artifact from metallic implants produce too much \nartifact on MRI.  \nArthrography  Wrist  \nConventional (x-ray) arthrography\u2014performed with contrast injection into one  or more  wrist compartments\u2014has \nmoderate accuracy for the diagnosis of TFCC perforations [7 ]."], ["Summary  of Recommendations \n\u2022 Variant  1: Radiography is usually appropriate for the initial imaging of clinically suspected osteonecrosis.  \n\u2022 Variant  2: MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for clinically suspected \nosteonecrosis following normal or suspicious radiographs.

However, MRI has \nbeen shown to be equivalent to CT for a ssessing both glenoid and humeral head bone loss [ 12,18,53], and CT is \nlimited in the assessment of cartilaginous Hill -Sachs lesions [11]. In addition, CT cannot assess injury to \nsoft-tissue structures like the labroligamentous complex, which further limits its usefulness in evaluating Bankart \nlesions.

MRI has been shown to have similar performance to CT in the evaluation of Hill-Sachs \nlesions and glenoid bone loss [12,18]. MR arthrography has also been found to be reliable in diagnosi ng anterior \nshoulder instability and labroligamentous injuries [58,59]. MR arthrography has specifically o utperformed \nnoncontrast MRI in assessment of glenohumeral ligament and anterior labral injuries [ 17,19], which ar e \ncommonly seen in shoulder instability. MR arthrogr aphy has also outperformed noncontrast MRI in diagnosis of \nrotator cuff tears [17,19], which is a common associated finding in older patients with shoulder dislocation. \nHowever, high sensitivities reported for MR arthrography in the detection of labral pathology may not be \napplicable to patients with clinically unstable shoulders. A retrospective review of 90 patients with clinically \nunstable shoulders selected for arthroscopy [ 60] found that MR arthrography had a sensitivity of 65% for \ndetection of labral  tears. The authors proposed that this discrepancy with prior studies was the result of different \npatient selection criteria (clinically unstable in their study versus less-specific symptoms such as shoulder pain in \nothers) and the interpretation of MR art hrography by experienced musculoskeletal radiologists [ 60]. For this \ndocument, it is assumed the procedure is performed and interpreted by an expert.  \nMRI Shoulder  \nMRI without contrast may be pre ferred to MR arthrography in the setting of acute shoulder dislocation when a \npost-traumatic joint effusion is present to provide sufficient visualization of soft -tissue structures. In the subacute \nor chronic setting, the glenohumeral joint effusion is usually too small to provide adequate joint distention for \noptimal assessment  of soft -tissue structures. Non contrast MRI has been shown to be inferior to MR arthrography \nin diagnosing labroligamentous and rotator cuff injuries [17,19]. Non contrast MRI performs comparably to CT in \nevaluating glenoid and humeral head bone loss [ 12,18], which may obviate the need for noncontrast CT . \nCT Arthrography  Shoulder  \nCT arthrography is effective in evaluation of shoulder instability. CT arthrogr aphy is comparable to MR \narthrography in the diagnosis of Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions [12] , and moderate agreement has been found \nbetween readers for diagnosing ant erior capsule laxity on CT arthrography. However, CT arthrography has been \nshown to be inferior to MR arthrography in assessing partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [12], which makes CT \narthrography less desirable in older patients with dislocation/instability where rotator cuff tears are common. CT \narthrography may be considered in a patient with shoulder dislocation/instabili ty and contraindication to MRI.  \nCT Shoulder  \nNoncontrast CT has historically been performed to assess bone loss in patients with recurrent dislocation or \nchronic instability. However, recent studies have shown MRI to be equivalent to CT in assessment of glenoid and \nhumeral head bone loss [12,18], which places in question the need for noncontrast CT in the assessment of \nshoulder instability. Noncontrast CT is als o unable to assess rotator cuff and labroligamentous pathology \ncommonly seen in shoulder dislocations/instability.

Coexisting \nhumeral avulsion of the glenohumeral ligament and significant glenoid bone loss have been found in up to 10% of \npatients with recurrent shoulder instability [ 56], which underscores the need to assess both osseous and \nlabroligamentous pathology in patients with shoulder dislocation or instability.

This \nlesion can be identified by absence of ulnar collateral ligament and the presence of a hypoechoic mass proximal to \nthe apex of the metacarpal tubercle [64].

Jersey finger refers to avulsion injury of flexor digitorum profundus from  insertion at base of distal \nphalanx. In patients with jers ey finger, MRI is commonly used to evaluate the level of tendon retraction, the \nquality of the tendon stump, and the associated injuries including pulley injuries [16]. In clinically equivocal \ncases, MRI may demonstrate injury to the central slip or the extensor hood [ 16]. \nMRI allows for the assessment of pulley system lesions [ 66,67]. MRI can accurately depict the pulley system, \nparticularly the A2 and A4 pulleys, with lower sensitivity for A3 and A5 pulleys [ 70].
