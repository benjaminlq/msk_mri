Nonlocalized shoulder pain. Negative radiographs . Next imaging \nstudy. \nAppropriately positioned  radiographs can exclude shoulder dislocation and most displaced fractures as the \netiology for post -traumatic shoulder pain. In the setting of normal shoulder radiographs, the most common causes \nof post -traumatic shoulder pain are soft -tissue injuries such  as rotator cuff and labral tears.  \nMRI Shoulder  \nNoncontrast MRI is a reasonable imaging study in the setting of acute nonlocalized traumatic shoulder pain and \nnoncontributory radiographs. In the acute trauma setting, noncontrast MRI may be preferred to MR arthrography , \nas acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint effusion for assessment of intra -articular \nsoft-tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic \npathology such as capsular and ligament tears [34,35]. MRI is also sensitive for diagnosing bone marrow \ncontusion and has  been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries in pediatric patients [ 36,37]. \nMR Arthrography  Shoulder  \nMR arthrography has been found to be superior to noncontrast MRI in the diagnosis of labroligamentous and \npartial -thickness rotator cuff tears [17,19]. In the acute trauma setting, however, noncontrast MRI may be \npreferred to MR arthrography because acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint \neffusion for assessment of intra-arti cular soft -tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing \nextra-articular soft -tissue traumatic pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [ 34,35]. MRI is also sensitive \nfor diagnosing bone marrow contusion and has been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries \nin pediatric patients [ 36,37]. \nUS Shoulder  \nUS has limited usefulness in patients with traumatic shoulder pain that cannot be localized to the rotator cuff or \nbiceps tendon. I n the post -traumatic setting, US has been shown to detect abnormalities, including proximal \nhumeral fractures [25]; however, recent studies on US performed for non specific shoulder pain have had \nconflicting results. US  for persistent shoulder pain after trauma has been found to diagnose significant pathology, \nprimarily fractures and rotator cuff tears, in 90% of patients [ 25]. However, 40% of patients presenting with \nnonspecific shoulder pain were found to have no significant pathology on US [38]. Additionally,  US has been \ndemonstrated to be inferior to MRI in assessment of labroligamentous, osseous, and rotator cuff pathology [ 17]. \nUS can b e considered as a screening tool in patients with persistent nonspecific shoulder pain after trauma, \nparticularly in an older patient population in whom rotator cuff tears are more common. However, a low threshold \nshould be maintained for performing additi onal imaging in the setting of a noncontributory shoulder US  \nexam ination . \nCT Shoulder  \nCT has virtually no usefulness in diagnosing common traumatic soft -tissue injuries such as rotator cuff tears, \nlabroligamentous injuries, and muscle tears. Although CT is  the gold standard for diagnosing and characterizing \nfractures, MRI has been shown to be equivalent to CT in diagnosing the nondisplaced fractures that are typically \nmissed on radiographs.  \nCT Arthrography  Shoulder  \nCT is inferior to MRI and US  in diagnosing virtually all extra -articular traumatic soft -tissues injuries. CT is \nconsidered the gold standard in identifying fractures . However, MRI has shown to be equivalent to CT in \nassessing bone loss [12,18], and MRI is usually adequate for diagnosing the nondisplaced fractures that are \ntypically missed on conventional radiographs. CT arthrography is able to reliably evaluat e for glenohumeral \ncartilage injury, SLAP tears, and labroligamentous injuries [ 12,39] but is generally considered inferior to MRI in \ndiagnosing  rotator cuff and soft -tissue Bankart lesions [ 12].", "However, this is not common \npractice, and US has been shown to be inferior to MRI in diagnosing the common structural abnormalities \nassociated with shoulder instability, such as labroligamentous injuries, Hill -Sachs lesions, and partial rotator cuff \ntears [17]. \nFDG -PET/CT  Skull Base to Mid-Thigh \nThere is no role for FDG-PET/CT  in assessment of shoulder instability . \nBone Scan  Shoulder  \nThere is no role for bone scintigraphy in assessment of shoulder instability . \nVariant 7: Traumatic shoulder pain.

MR arthrography has also been found to be reliable in diagnosi ng anterior \nshoulder instability and labroligamentous injuries [58,59]. MR arthrography has specifically o utperformed \nnoncontrast MRI in assessment of glenohumeral ligament and anterior labral injuries [ 17,19], which ar e \ncommonly seen in shoulder instability. MR arthrogr aphy has also outperformed noncontrast MRI in diagnosis of \nrotator cuff tears [17,19], which is a common associated finding in older patients with shoulder dislocation. \nHowever, high sensitivities reported for MR arthrography in the detection of labral pathology may not be \napplicable to patients with clinically unstable shoulders. A retrospective review of 90 patients with clinically \nunstable shoulders selected for arthroscopy [ 60] found that MR arthrography had a sensitivity of 65% for \ndetection of labral  tears. The authors proposed that this discrepancy with prior studies was the result of different \npatient selection criteria (clinically unstable in their study versus less-specific symptoms such as shoulder pain in \nothers) and the interpretation of MR art hrography by experienced musculoskeletal radiologists [ 60]. For this \ndocument, it is assumed the procedure is performed and interpreted by an expert.  \nMRI Shoulder  \nMRI without contrast may be pre ferred to MR arthrography in the setting of acute shoulder dislocation when a \npost-traumatic joint effusion is present to provide sufficient visualization of soft -tissue structures. In the subacute \nor chronic setting, the glenohumeral joint effusion is usually too small to provide adequate joint distention for \noptimal assessment  of soft -tissue structures. Non contrast MRI has been shown to be inferior to MR arthrography \nin diagnosing labroligamentous and rotator cuff injuries [17,19]. Non contrast MRI performs comparably to CT in \nevaluating glenoid and humeral head bone loss [ 12,18], which may obviate the need for noncontrast CT . \nCT Arthrography  Shoulder  \nCT arthrography is effective in evaluation of shoulder instability. CT arthrogr aphy is comparable to MR \narthrography in the diagnosis of Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions [12] , and moderate agreement has been found \nbetween readers for diagnosing ant erior capsule laxity on CT arthrography. However, CT arthrography has been \nshown to be inferior to MR arthrography in assessing partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [12], which makes CT \narthrography less desirable in older patients with dislocation/instability where rotator cuff tears are common. CT \narthrography may be considered in a patient with shoulder dislocation/instabili ty and contraindication to MRI.  \nCT Shoulder  \nNoncontrast CT has historically been performed to assess bone loss in patients with recurrent dislocation or \nchronic instability. However, recent studies have shown MRI to be equivalent to CT in assessment of glenoid and \nhumeral head bone loss [12,18], which places in question the need for noncontrast CT in the assessment of \nshoulder instability. Noncontrast CT is als o unable to assess rotator cuff and labroligamentous pathology \ncommonly seen in shoulder dislocations/instability. In general, CT should be reserved for patients with a \ncontraindication to MRI or patients in whom MRI assessment of bone loss is limited.  \nUS Shoulder  \nThere is no defined role for US  in the assessment of shoulder dislocation  or instability.

Kransdorf, MD.p \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nTraumatic shoulder pain is shoulder pain believed to be directly attributed to a traumatic event, either acute or \nchronic. This pain may be the result of either fracture (the clavicle, scapula, or proximal humerus) or soft -tissue \ninjury (most commonly of the rotator cuff, acromioclavicular ligaments, or labroligamentous complex). The \nincidence of traumatic shoulder injuries is difficult to determine because some injury types, such as low-grade \nacromioclavicular separations or acute rotator cuff tears, are likely under -reported because patients  do not seek \nimmediate medical treatment. However, as with many traumatic injuries, traumatic shoulder pain tends to \ndisproportionately involve young adults and male patients [ 1,2]. \nThe etiology of traumatic shoulder pain can often be made based on clinical examination, radiographs, and \nmechanism of injury. Traumatic shoulder injuries can generally be separated into in juries requiring acute surgical \nmanagement and injuries in which conservative management can be attempted prior to considering surgical \ntreatment. Unstable or significantly displaced fractures and joint instability are injuries most likely requiring acute \nsurgical treatment. Most soft -tissue injuries (such as labral tears and rotator cuff tears) can undergo a period of \nconservative management prior to considering surgery. However, in addition to the specific imaging findings \nrelated to a traumatic injury, indications and timing of surgical treatment of many traumatic shoulder injuries are \ndependent on patient age, comorbidities, current activity level, and expected activity level.  \nImaging of chronic shoulder pain is beyond the scope of this topic  and is cove red in the  ACR Appropriateness \nCriteria\u00ae on \u201cShoulder Pain\u2013 Atraumatic \u201d [3]. \nDiscussion o f Procedures  by Variant  \nVariant 1:  Traumatic shoulder pain. Any etiology . Initial imaging . \nRadiography Shoulder  \nRadiographs are the preferred initial study performed in the setting of traumatic shoulder pain . They can delineate \nshoulder malalignment and most shoulder fractures [ 4,5]. A standard set of shoulder radiographs for trauma \nshould include at least three  views: anterior -posterior (AP) views in internal and external rotation and an axillary \nor scapula-Y view. Axillary or scapula-Y views are vital in evaluating traumatic shoulder injuries as \nacromioclavicular and glenohumeral dislocations can be misclassified on AP  views [6,7]. Radiographs provide \ngood delineation of bony anatomy to assess for fracture and appropriate shoulder alignment, which are the two \nprimary concerns in management of acute traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs should also be performed upright \nsince malalignment of the shoul der can be under -represented on supine radiographs [ 4]. Additional views, such as \nthe Bernageau view, have been sho wn to be effective in demonstrating the degree of bone loss of the glenoid or \nhumeral head [ 8]. \nCT Shoulder  \nComputed tomography ( CT) is better able than radiogr aphs to characteriz e fracture patterns [ 9-11].", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 11 Shoulder Pain \u2013Traumatic  Variant 5: Traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs show Bankart  or Hill-Sachs lesion. Next imaging  study. \nBankart and Hill -Sachs lesions are common findings associated with transient shoulder dislocation. Bankart \nlesions have a particularly high association with transient shoulder dislocations [50], and a transient shoulder \ndislocation should be presumed if a Bankart lesion is present. A close association exists bet ween Bankart and \nHill-Sachs lesions [ 51], and one should be sought out whenever the other is identified on radiographs. Both \nBankart and Hill -Sachs lesions can present as nonosseous  lesions that are occult on r adiographs and noncontrast \nCT. \nMRI Shoulder  \nSimilar to MR arthrography, noncontrast MRI is comparable to CT in evaluating glenoid and humeral head bone \nloss [12,18]. In general, noncontrast MRI performs well in diagnosing labroligamentous injuries [ 20,52]. \nHowever, noncontrast MRI is considered inferior to MR arthrography for assessing labroligamentous pathology \nfrequently associated with Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions [ 17,19]. Noncontrast MRI is a good alternative to MR \narthrography in the setting of acute injury when significant glenohumeral joint effusion is present to assist in \nvisualization of intra -articular soft -tissue pathology.  \nMR Arthrography  Shoulder  \nMR arthrography is the preferred study for evaluating subacute or chronic Bankart lesions because of  its soft -\ntissue contrast. Multiple studies have shown MR arthrography to be reliable in diagnosing labroligamentous \ninjuries [12,17,52] and superior to noncontrast MRI for this indication [ 17,19]. MR arthrography has been shown \nto be equivalent to CT in the assess ment of glenoid and humeral head bone loss [ 12,18], while being superior to \nCT in assessment of labroligamentous in juries [12]. MR arthrography is also able to delineate humeral head and \nglenoid cartilage, which can be important because some Hill -Sachs lesions affect  cartilage only  [11]. \nCT Shoulder  \nNoncontrast CT has historically been used to assess Hill -Sachs and bony Bankart lesions. However, MRI has \nbeen shown to be equivalent to CT for a ssessing both glenoid and humeral head bone loss [ 12,18,53], and CT is \nlimited in the assessment of cartilaginous Hill -Sachs lesions [11]. In addition, CT cannot assess injury to \nsoft-tissue structures like the labroligamentous complex, which further limits its usefulness in evaluating Bankart \nlesions. CT should be reserved for patients with a contraindication to MRI or patients in whom MRI assessment \nof bone loss is limited.  \nCT Arthrography  Shoulder  \nCT arthrography has sho wn fair agreement between observers and is comparable to MR arthrography in \ndiagnosing Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions [ 12,13]. However, CT arthrography is inferior to MRI in diagnosing \nother soft -tissue pathology [ 12]. CT arthrography can be considered a reasonable imaging alterna tive in patients \nwith contraindication to MRI. \nUS Shoulder  \nThere is no role for US  in assessment of Bankart or Hill -Sachs lesions. US  has been demonstrated to be inferior to \nMRI in diagnosing both labroligamentous injury and Hill -Sachs lesions [ 17]. \nFDG -PET/CT  Skull Base to Mid-Thigh \nThere is no role for FDG-PET/CT  in assessment of  Bankart or Hill -Sachs lesions.  \nBone Scan  Shoulder  \nThere is no role for bone scintigraphy in assessment of Bankart or Hill -Sachs lesions.  \nVariant 6: Traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs normal.  Physical examination and history consistent \nwith dislocation event  or instability . Next imaging study.", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 10 Chronic Shoulder Pain  US Shoulder  \nUS is reported  to be 98% sensitive and 94% specific for calcium  hydroxyapatite  in the rotator  cuff tendons  [71], \nalthough  identification  may be challenging if the area of calcium  deposition  is small . At times  US may have  \ndifficulty  distinguishing calcific  deposits  from  heterotopic  ossification  because both can result  in dense shadowing  \nat US. US can be used if there  is concern  for concomitant  rotator  cuff tendon tear and may be a better  modality  than \nMRI in this situation  given the difficulty  of distinguishing  calcium  from  normal  tendon at MRI.  \nVariant  4: Chronic  shoulder  pain. Suspect  labral pathology  or shoulder  instability.  Initial radiographs  \nnormal  or inconclusive. Next  imaging  study.  \nBone  Scan  Shoulder  \nThere is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of bone  scan shoulder  in the evaluation  of chronic  shoulder  pain \nwhen  labral  pathology  or shoulder  instability  is suspected.  \nCT Arthrography  Shoulder  \nCT arthrograms  have  been  shown  to be an accurate modality  in the assessment  of shoulder  instability  because of  its \ndepiction  of osseous,  cartilaginous,  and labroligamentous  injuries  [18,72] . Labral  evaluation  in the postoperative  \nsetting  may be better  with CT arthrography than MRI  in patients  with metallic  suture  anchors  [73] and has been  \nused to evaluate for healing  after superior  labrum  anterior -to-posterior  (SLAP)  repair  [74]. Dual -energy  CT \narthrography  has a similar  diagnostic  performance  as MR arthrography  [75]. Although CT arthrography aids in the \nevaluation  of underlying soft tissues,  the injected  contrast  may limit evaluation  of the underlying osseous structures,  \nand cortical  fragments in the injected  contrast  solution  often  have a similar  attenuation  to cortical  bone  [76]. Other  \nlimitations  include  the need  for an invasive  arthrography procedure  and poor assessment  of bone  marrow  edema  \n[72]. \nCT Shoulder  With  IV Contrast  \nThere is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of CT shoulder  with IV contrast  in the evaluation  of chronic  \nshoulder  pain when  labral  pathology or shoulder  instability  is suspected.  \nCT Shoulder  Without  and With  IV Contrast  \nThere is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of CT shoulder  without  and with IV contrast  in the evaluation  of \nchronic  shoulder  pain when  labral  pathology or shoulder  instability  is suspected.  \nCT Shoulder  Without  IV Contrast  \nCT is helpful  for assessing  bony  glenoid deficiency  as well as the size of a Hill-Sachs deformity  when  surgery  is a \nconsideration  but is not effective at evaluating  the labrum.  CT is often  preferable  to MRI when  evaluating  for small  \nfracture  fragments of the glenoid rim and assessing  bone  stock  in patients  with recurrent  dislocation  [77-79]. Three-\ndimensional  reconstructions  can be used to quantify  osseous defect  width  and glenoid  surface area [80,81] . CT can \nalso be used to measure the size of a Hill-Sachs defect  [82,83] , which  has become more  important  with the \ndevelopment  of the glenoid track  concept  for determining  instability  [84,85] . In the postoperative  setting, CT can \nbe used to evaluate integration  of bone  graft  from  a coracoid  transfer  with the underlying glenoid [86,87] .", "Next imaging study. \nShoulder dislocation or instability is most co mmon in the anterior direction. Younger patients are more likely to \nhave labroligamentous injury and persistent instability after dislocation compared with older patients [54]. Older \npatients are more likely to have rotator cuff tears in association with shoulder dislocation [ 55]. Coexisting \nhumeral avulsion of the glenohumeral ligament and significant glenoid bone loss have been found in up to 10% of \npatients with recurrent shoulder instability [ 56], which underscores the need to assess both osseous and \nlabroligamentous pathology in patients with shoulder dislocation or instability. Glenoid morphology and bone \nloss can play a significant factor in recurrent shoulder dislocations [15, 16,57], which may require bone grafting in \norder to restore stability [ 57]."], ["Noncontrast  and contrast -enhanced  MRI have  overall similar  diagnostic  utility  for evaluation  of the sacroiliac joints  \nin axSpA  [107-111] .

Uptake on PET/CT has also been  shown  to correlate with clinical  disease activity  in patients with \naxSpA  [66,67] ; however,  there is conflicting  evidence regarding the extent  to which  tracer  uptake  correlates with \nspecific inflammatory  and structural  lesions seen on CT and MRI resulting  in uncertain ty about  its diagnostic  utility  \n[64,67- 72]. In one study,  the interreader  reliability  of diagnosing  sacroiliitis  on PET/CT was poor and substantially  \nlower  than that for MRI or CT [67]. In a small  study using  radiographs  as the reference standard,  F-18-fluoride  \nPET/CT had a sensitivity  of 80% and specificity  of 77% for the detection  of sacroiliitis  in AS, although  there are \ninherent  limitations  in the use of radiographs  as the reference standard  for diagnosing  axSpA  [73]. Given  the \navailable data,  the utility  of PET/CT in the diagnosis  of axSpA , including its utility  in assessment  of the spine,  is \nuncertain  at this time.  \nMRI Spine  Area  of Interest  \nAlthough MRI  of the sacroiliac joints  has high utility  for the diagnosis  of axSpA,  some  patients  will not demonstrate  \nimaging  features of axSpA  in the sacroiliac joints  on MRI as indicated  by sensitivities  of all studies to varying \ndegrees below  100%  [22], and therefore  some  patients may need  further imaging  evaluation  with MRI given that it \nis the imaging  modality  of choice for the diagnosis  of axSpA  [1,3,19,22] . Studies  have  shown  widely varying  \ndegrees of isolated  spinal  involvement  on MRI in axSpA  ranging from  1% to 49% [19,59-63,114,115] . Therefore,  \nimag ing of the spine  is beneficial  for patients  in whom  there is suspicion  for axSpA  but imaging  of the sacroiliac \njoints  has been  negative.  Some  authors  have  shown  the utility  of using  whole -spine  or whole -body  MRI to identify  \nthe burden of disease rather  than selecting  specific areas of the spine  to image  because findings  may be potentially  \nisolated  to any portion of the spine  [10,59,63,89,114,120-122] . \nThe spine  MRI  findings  of axSpA  include  the active inflammatory  changes of spondylitis  and spondylodiscitis,  the \ninflammatory  changes of the costovertebral  joints,  costotransverse joints,  and facet  joints  and areas of enthesitis  \nalong other  vertebral  ligamentous  attachments [123] . The chronic  structural  changes of fatty deposition,  erosions,  \nand syndesmophytes  are also characteristic findings  [123] . One study showed  that the presence of two or more  \ncorner  inflammatory  lesions had a sensitivity  of 69% and specificity  of 94% for AS and that lateral  vertebral  \ninflammatory  lesions had high specificity  of 97% [120] .", "ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 12 Inflammatory  Back  Pain US Spine  Area  of Interest  \nUS is not beneficial  as a diagnostic  tool for the evaluation  of sacroiliitis  in patients  with suspected  axSpA  because \nof its lack of established  diagnostic  utility  [22]. Importantly,  US provides  limited  evaluation  of the superficial  \nposterior  margins  of the spine,  and therefore  many  structural  details  are not demonstrated.

The prevalen ce of axSpA  is estimated  to be between  0.9% to 1.4%  in the \nUnited  States  adult  population [2]. There  is a genetic component  to axSpA,  including  a strong  association  with \nHLA-B27 , which  is positive  in 74% to 89% of patients  [1]. Patients  with axSpA  often  present  before  age 45 with \nchronic  back  pain and stiffness and may have  elevated  inflammatory  markers  [3]. A clinical hallmark  is the presence  \nof inflammatory  back  pain,  which  is present  in 70% to 80% of patients  [4]. There are varying definitions  for \ninflammatory  back  pain,  although  characteristically  this pain includes the following  features:  insidious  onset,  \nimprovement  with exercise,  no improvement  with rest, occurring  at night,  and age of onset  <40 years of age [4]. \nInflammatory  back  pain symptoms,  depending on the criteria  used,  have  been  reportedly been  present  in 5% to 6% \nof the general  adult  population  [5], and in up to 15% of patients  in the primary  care setting  [6]. Although recognition  \nof axSpA  is improving,  a mean  delay  of 4.9 years from  onset  of symptoms  to diagnosis  was recently  reported , \nhighlighting the challenge of establishing  this diagnosis  early  in the disease course  [7]. \nPatients  with axSpA  suffer from  an inflammatory  arthropathy  of the axial  skeleton  that classically  involves  the \nsacroiliac  joints  initially  [3]. There is some  heterogeneity in disease distribution  within  axSpA  subtypes . Patients  \nwith AS typically  develop bilateral  sacroiliitis , whereas patients  with other  subtypes , such as psoriatic  \nspondyloarthritis , develop either  unilateral  or bilateral  sacroiliitis  [8]. Classically,  axSpA  after first involving the \nsacroiliac joints and then may progress  to involve  the spine . However,  the pattern  of disease can be variable with a \nminority  of patients  having isolated  spine  involvement  [3]. The thoracic spine  and thoracolumbar  junction  are the \nmost  common  sites of spinal  involvement  [9-13]. The inflammatory  changes of enthesitis,  synovitis,  and osteitis  in \naxSpA  result s in bone  erosion,  sclerosis,  bone  formation,  and potentially  ankylosis  at sites of involvement  [1].", "ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 10 Inflammatory  Back  Pain attention  to identify  associated  morphologic  findings  such as disc degeneration  or osteophytes  that favor  \ndegenerative changes rather  than axSpA , because both inflammatory  and fatty lesions can occur  in degenerative  \nchanges [124] . \nContrast -enhanced  MRI can demonstrate active inflammatory  changes of the sacroiliac joints  and spine  in axSpA,  \nalthough  multiple  studies show  that noncontrast  and contrast -enhanced  MRI have  overall  similar  diagnostic  utility  \nfor axSpA  [9,107-111,125- 129]. Contrast -enhanced  MRI has been  reported  to increase the diagnostic  confidence  \nand reliability  of MRI interpretation  in 2 studies [9,107] . \nUS Sacroiliac  Joints   \nUS is not suggested  as a routine  diagnostic  modality  for the evaluation  of sacroiliitis  in patients  with suspected  \naxSpA  because of  its lack of established  diagnostic  utility  [22]. Importantly,  US provides  evaluation  limited  to the \nsuperficial  posterior  margins  of the sacroiliac joints, and therefore  many  structural  details  are not demonstrated.  \nMany  of the available  studies examine  the utility  of Doppler  evaluation.  It has been  shown  that patients  with active \nsacroiliitis  because of  axSpA  have  lower  Doppler  US resistive indices than healthy  controls  or patients with \nosteoarthritis  at the sacroiliac joints  [130-132] .

One study \nreported  higher  sensitivity  of contrast -enhanced  US compared  with conventional  US [134,135] . A recent  systematic  \nreview of US of the sacroiliac joints  in spondyloarthritis  reported  a median  sensitivity  of 90% and specificity  of \n89% in seven  of those  studies,  although with variation  in the method of evaluation  and reference standard . The \nauthors  concluded that there  is not enough  evidence to support  the use of US for the diagnosis  of axSpA  [136] . \nUS Sacroiliac  Joints  and Spine  Area  of Interest  \nUS is not suggested  as a routine  diagnostic  modality  for the evaluation  of sacroiliitis  in patients  with suspected  \naxSpA  because of  its lack of established  diagnostic  utility  [22].

These procedures are equivalent alternatives.", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 5 Acute Hand and Wrist Trauma  Most fractures of the thumb are visible on a 2-view radiographic examination, although there is a slight increase \nin dia gnostic yield with the addition of an oblique projection [ 13], which can be obtained along with a PA \nexamination of the whole hand.  \nIn patients with suspected finger tendon injuries, radiographs are used to detect fracture fragments, as large \nfragments may require open reduction and internal fixation.  Radiographs are usually sufficient for  the evaluation \nof osseous \u201cmallet\u201d injuries, which include bony avulsion at the insertion of the extensor mechanism of the finger \nto the distal interphalangeal joint [16]. In these injuries, involvement of more than one -third of the articular \nsurface usually requires operative fixation.  Palmar displacement of the distal phalanx or an interfragmentary gap \nof >3 mm is also an indication for surgery [ 16]. With extensor tendon injuries, radiographs are commonly used to \nassess for bone involve ment and determine need for operative fixation [ 17]. \nCT Area of Interest  \nIn patients with intra -articular fractures seen on radiography , CT shows articular fracture fragment displacement, \ndepression, and comminution more accurately than conventional radiographs [ 7,9,10]. CT measurements of \narticular surface gap and step -off are more reproducible than radiographs [7]. The addition of 3- D surface -\nrendered reconstructions to the standard 2 -D CT images has been shown to change operative management in up to \n48% of intra -articular distal radius fractures [8]. \nThere is no evidence to support the use of CT with intravenous  (IV) contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist \ntrauma.  \nMRI Area of Interest  \nMRI is not indicated initially in this clinical setting. \nUS Area of Interest  \nUS is not indicated initially in this clinical setting. \nBone Scan Area of  Interest  \nBone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  \nVariant 2: Suspect acute hand or wrist trauma.

Next imaging \nstudy. \nRadiograph y Area of Interest  \nIn patients with clinical suspicion of hand or wrist fracture and negative radiographs, one option is to place the \npatient in a short arm cast and repeat the radiographs at 10  to 14 days [ 13]. The downside of this option is that it \nresults in delay of diagnosis , which may lead to functional impairment . \nCT Area of Interest  \nWhen the initial radiographs are equivocal, CT  without IV contrast  is commonly used to exclude or confirm \nsuspected wrist fractures [18]. CT shows intra-articular extension of distal radius fractures more frequently than \nradiography.  Three-dimensional reconstructions can be particularly helpful in preoperative planning for complex \narticular injuries  [7,8]. \nCT should be used to exclude an occult fracture of the upper extremity. Unlike MRI, CT cannot evaluate for \nconcomitant ligamentous injuries  [19-21 ]. \nCT is useful in diagnosing injuries that are difficult to recognize on radiographs, such as carpometacarpal joint \nfracture dislocations. For metacarpal and digital  fractures, CT is usually not indicated during acute injury [ 22]. \nThere is no evidence to support the use of CT with IV contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist trauma.  \nMRI Area o f Interest  \nWhen initial radiographs are normal but there is high clinical suspicion for fracture, MRI without IV contrast can \ndetect fractures of the distal radius and carpal bones [12,23-25] . One study of patients in which the radiographic \nfindings did not explain the clinical symptoms reported that the MRI led to a change in diagnosis in 55% of \npatients and a change in patient management in 66%  [12]. However, another study of patients with acutely injured \nwrists reported that the MRI did not predict the need for treatment better than the combination of physical \nexamination and radiography [ 23].

Kransdorf, MD.o \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nHand injuries account for approximately 20% of emergency department visits [ 1]. According to the National \nHospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey , 1.5% of all emergency department visits involve  hand and wrist \nfractu res. Distal radius fractures are especially common, accounting for up to 18% of fractures in the elderly [ 2,3]. \nBecause of increasing rates of osteoporosis, the incidence of distal radius fractures has been increasing [ 4]. \nAlthough most distal radius fractures in e lderly patients are managed non operatively, the use of internal fixation is \nincreasing. Internal fixation has a much higher cost than nonopera tive treatment as well as increased rates of \nhospitalization [5]. \nFor most patients with trauma to the hand and wrist, conventional radiographs provide sufficient diagnostic \ninformation to guide the treating physician.  However, delayed diagnosis is common because distal radius and \nscaphoid fractures may be radiographically occult  [6]. When initial radiographs  are normal but there is high \nclinical suspicion for fracture, further imaging with additional radiographic pr ojections, CT, or MRI  is \nappropriate . If associated soft -tissue injury is clinically suspected, CT, CT arthrography, MR I, MR arthrography, \nor ultrasound (US) may be indicated  [7-10]. \nSuccessful treatment of distal radius fractures requires restoration of radial length, inclination, and tilt, as well as \nthe realignment of the articular fracture fragments [9,11]. The presence of a coronally  oriented fracture line, die -\npunch depression, or more than three articular fracture fragments are common indications for operative reduction \n[8]. Operative fixation resulting in < 2 mm of residual articular surface step-off is usually considered necessary to \navoid long-term complications , such as osteoarthritis [9 ,12]. \nDiscussion of Procedures by Variant  \nVariant 1: Acute blunt or penetrating trauma to the hand or wrist. Initial imaging.  \nRadiograph y Area of Interest  \nRadiography is  always indicated as the initial imaging for suspected acute hand and wrist trauma.  For m ost joints \nof the extremities, especially those involving the wrist, hand, and fingers, a radiographic examination that \nincludes only 2 views is not adequate for detecting fractures [13]. For patients with suspected  distal radius \nfractures, a 3-view examination  of the wrist  usually includes a posteroanterior (PA) , a lateral, and a 45\u00b0 \nsemi pronated oblique view  [11]. One study [ 14] reports that a fourth projection\u2014a semisupinated oblique \u2014\nincreases diagnostic yield for distal radius fractures.  \nA standard 3 -view radiographic examination of the hand shows most fractures and dislocations of the metacarpals \nand phalanges [ 13]. For phalangeal injuries, some centers include a PA examination of the entire hand, whereas \nothers limit the examination to the injured finger.  An internally rotated oblique project ion, in addition to the \nstandard externally rotated oblique, increases diagnostic yield for phalangeal fractures [15]. \n                                                 \naResearch Author, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston Salem, North Carolina. bWake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston \nSalem, North Carolina.", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 14 Chronic Wrist Pain  sheaths) are well depicted with MRI. MRI is useful for diagnosing infectious and noninfectious tenosynovitis in \nboth the flexor and extensor wrist compartments [46]. Occult ganglion cysts are also easily identified with MRI, \nbut some authors recommend use of IV contrast to distinguish ganglia from synovitis [ 47]. For noncystic soft-\ntissue masses, MRI may demonstrate findings that are diagnostic for certain benign conditions (eg, lipomas, \nhemangiomas, benign nerve sheath tumors), and can stage the extent of involvement for nonspecific masses ( see \nthe ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae topic on \u201c Soft-Tissue Masses \u201d [48]). \nUS Wrist  \nWrist US or MRI (without or without  and with IV contrast) are alternative initial examinations that are usually \nappropriate in this setting. US  is useful for examining extra -articular soft tissue s, such as suspected ganglion cysts \n[17],  with an accuracy similar to that  of MRI.  \nCT Wrist  \nThere is no support in the literature for CT in the initial diagnosis of a palpable mass or suspected ganglion cyst \nwith normal or nonspecific radiologic findings. CT may have a role in cases in which calcification or ossification \nis demo nstrated radiologically, or in the staging of a lesion that is first evaluated by MRI or US , but CT with or \nwithout IV contrast are usually not appropriate initial examinations for a suspected soft -tissue mass.  \nMR Arthrography  Wrist  \nMR arthrography is not routinely used to evaluate a palpable mass or ganglion cyst.  \nCT Arthrography  Wrist  \nCT arthrography is not routinely used to evaluate a palpable mass or ganglion cyst.  \nBone Scan  Wrist  \nBone scan is not routinely used to evaluate a palpable mass or ganglion c yst. \nArthrography  Wrist  \nRadiographic arthrography  is not routinely used to evaluate a palpable mass or ganglion cyst . \nVariant 10: Chronic wrist pain. Suspect occult fracture or stress fracture. Radiographs nondiagnostic. \nNext study.  \nMRI Wrist  \nEither MRI without I V contrast or CT without IV contrast is usually appropriate in this scenario. MRI is highly \nsensitive to changes in bone marrow composition, and thus is frequently used to identify radiographically occult \nacute fractures throughout the skeleton, including in the wrist (see the ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae topic on \n\u201cAcute Hand and Wrist Trauma\u201d [49]). In patients with persistent symptoms thought to be due to an occult wrist \nfracture, MRI can be used as an alternative to presumptive casting and repeat radiographs [ 12]. MRI is also \nsensitive to stress fractures and stress injuries of the physes, for example, in gymnasts [50].  IV contrast does not \nadd to the examination and is usually not appropriate.  \nCT Wrist  \nEither CT without IV contrast or MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate in this scenario. CT can provide high-detail imaging of bone cortex a nd trabeculae and thus can be used to identify radiographically occult  \nfractures and stress fractures. Acquisition times are shorter for CT compared to MRI, and CT may be easier to \nperform in patients who are casted. However, MRI\u2019s sensitivity for bone bru ises and soft -tissue injuries is greater \nthan CT. In specific circumstances\u2014like suspected fractures of the hook of the hamate\u2014 CT may be preferable to \nMRI.

Radiographs normal or nonspecific. Suspect carpal tunnel syndrome.  Next \nstudy. \nUS Wrist \nSeveral meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the \ncarpal  tunnel  inlet) is highly accurate for identifying carpal  tunnel syndrome  diagnosed clinically or with the \ncombination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US \nvaries depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the \nmeasurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary \nexamination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel \nsyndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal \ntunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, \nclinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of \ncarpal tunnel syndrome. US may be appropriate in cases where this initial evaluation is equivocal.  \nMRI Wrist  \nHistorically, carpal tunnel syndrome has been diagnosed based on clinical signs and sympt oms and confirmed by \nthe results of electrodiagnostic studies [67]. MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in cases in which this  \ninitial evaluation is equivocal. The MRI findings that have been reported in wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome \u2014\nincluding nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing\u2014may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value \nin patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68]. In rare cases of secondary carpal tunnel syndrome, MRI may identify \na mass lesion compressing the median nerve. There is some evidence that the length of T2 hyperintensity in the \nmedian nerve can help prognosticate the success of surgery [69] and that the shape and signal of the nerve predict \nclinical response to a steroid injection in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome [70 ]. MR neurography \nmay be an option in patients with suspected carpal tunnel syndrome.

There are no comparable studies of the hand and wrist.  \nMRI may be useful in certain circumstances,  such as with complicated foreign bodies.  MRI helps identify foreign \nbodies by the presence of air or metal susceptib ility artifact or adjacent edema or fibrosis.

According to the National \nHospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey , 1.5% of all emergency department visits involve  hand and wrist \nfractu res. Distal radius fractures are especially common, accounting for up to 18% of fractures in the elderly [ 2,3]. \nBecause of increasing rates of osteoporosis, the incidence of distal radius fractures has been increasing [ 4]. \nAlthough most distal radius fractures in e lderly patients are managed non operatively, the use of internal fixation is \nincreasing. Internal fixation has a much higher cost than nonopera tive treatment as well as increased rates of \nhospitalization [5]. \nFor most patients with trauma to the hand and wrist, conventional radiographs provide sufficient diagnostic \ninformation to guide the treating physician.  However, delayed diagnosis is common because distal radius and \nscaphoid fractures may be radiographically occult  [6]. When initial radiographs  are normal but there is high \nclinical suspicion for fracture, further imaging with additional radiographic pr ojections, CT, or MRI  is \nappropriate . If associated soft -tissue injury is clinically suspected, CT, CT arthrography, MR I, MR arthrography, \nor ultrasound (US) may be indicated  [7-10]. \nSuccessful treatment of distal radius fractures requires restoration of radial length, inclination, and tilt, as well as \nthe realignment of the articular fracture fragments [9,11]. The presence of a coronally  oriented fracture line, die -\npunch depression, or more than three articular fracture fragments are common indications for operative reduction \n[8]. Operative fixation resulting in < 2 mm of residual articular surface step-off is usually considered necessary to \navoid long-term complications , such as osteoarthritis [9 ,12]. \nDiscussion of Procedures by Variant  \nVariant 1: Acute blunt or penetrating trauma to the hand or wrist. Initial imaging.  \nRadiograph y Area of Interest  \nRadiography is  always indicated as the initial imaging for suspected acute hand and wrist trauma.  For m ost joints \nof the extremities, especially those involving the wrist, hand, and fingers, a radiographic examination that \nincludes only 2 views is not adequate for detecting fractures [13]. For patients with suspected  distal radius \nfractures, a 3-view examination  of the wrist  usually includes a posteroanterior (PA) , a lateral, and a 45\u00b0 \nsemi pronated oblique view  [11]. One study [ 14] reports that a fourth projection\u2014a semisupinated oblique \u2014\nincreases diagnostic yield for distal radius fractures.  \nA standard 3 -view radiographic examination of the hand shows most fractures and dislocations of the metacarpals \nand phalanges [ 13]. For phalangeal injuries, some centers include a PA examination of the entire hand, whereas \nothers limit the examination to the injured finger.  An internally rotated oblique project ion, in addition to the \nstandard externally rotated oblique, increases diagnostic yield for phalangeal fractures [15]. \n                                                 \naResearch Author, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston Salem, North Carolina. bWake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston \nSalem, North Carolina.", "In other patients, nonspecific radiologic findings (including those in the soft  tissues) combined with the history and physical examination may be \nsufficient for clinical diagnosis, or may suggest preferred secondary imaging studies.  \nMRI  \nMRI is no t routinely used in the initial evaluation of chronic wrist pain.", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 5 Acute Hand and Wrist Trauma  Most fractures of the thumb are visible on a 2-view radiographic examination, although there is a slight increase \nin dia gnostic yield with the addition of an oblique projection [ 13], which can be obtained along with a PA \nexamination of the whole hand.  \nIn patients with suspected finger tendon injuries, radiographs are used to detect fracture fragments, as large \nfragments may require open reduction and internal fixation.  Radiographs are usually sufficient for  the evaluation \nof osseous \u201cmallet\u201d injuries, which include bony avulsion at the insertion of the extensor mechanism of the finger \nto the distal interphalangeal joint [16]. In these injuries, involvement of more than one -third of the articular \nsurface usually requires operative fixation.  Palmar displacement of the distal phalanx or an interfragmentary gap \nof >3 mm is also an indication for surgery [ 16]. With extensor tendon injuries, radiographs are commonly used to \nassess for bone involve ment and determine need for operative fixation [ 17]. \nCT Area of Interest  \nIn patients with intra -articular fractures seen on radiography , CT shows articular fracture fragment displacement, \ndepression, and comminution more accurately than conventional radiographs [ 7,9,10]. CT measurements of \narticular surface gap and step -off are more reproducible than radiographs [7]. The addition of 3- D surface -\nrendered reconstructions to the standard 2 -D CT images has been shown to change operative management in up to \n48% of intra -articular distal radius fractures [8]. \nThere is no evidence to support the use of CT with intravenous  (IV) contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist \ntrauma.  \nMRI Area of Interest  \nMRI is not indicated initially in this clinical setting. \nUS Area of Interest  \nUS is not indicated initially in this clinical setting. \nBone Scan Area of  Interest  \nBone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  \nVariant 2: Suspect acute hand or wrist trauma. Initial radiographs nega tive or equivocal. Next imaging \nstudy. \nRadiograph y Area of Interest  \nIn patients with clinical suspicion of hand or wrist fracture and negative radiographs, one option is to place the \npatient in a short arm cast and repeat the radiographs at 10  to 14 days [ 13]. The downside of this option is that it \nresults in delay of diagnosis , which may lead to functional impairment . \nCT Area of Interest  \nWhen the initial radiographs are equivocal, CT  without IV contrast  is commonly used to exclude or confirm \nsuspected wrist fractures [18]. CT shows intra-articular extension of distal radius fractures more frequently than \nradiography.  Three-dimensional reconstructions can be particularly helpful in preoperative planning for complex \narticular injuries  [7,8]. \nCT should be used to exclude an occult fracture of the upper extremity. Unlike MRI, CT cannot evaluate for \nconcomitant ligamentous injuries  [19-21 ]. \nCT is useful in diagnosing injuries that are difficult to recognize on radiographs, such as carpometacarpal joint \nfracture dislocations. For metacarpal and digital  fractures, CT is usually not indicated during acute injury [ 22]. \nThere is no evidence to support the use of CT with IV contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist trauma.  \nMRI Area o f Interest  \nWhen initial radiographs are normal but there is high clinical suspicion for fracture, MRI without IV contrast can \ndetect fractures of the distal radius and carpal bones [12,23-25] . One study of patients in which the radiographic \nfindings did not explain the clinical symptoms reported that the MRI led to a change in diagnosis in 55% of \npatients and a change in patient management in 66%  [12]. However, another study of patients with acutely injured \nwrists reported that the MRI did not predict the need for treatment better than the combination of physical \nexamination and radiography [ 23]. More importantly, there was no difference in outcomes  with MRI compared \nwith radiography [24].", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 16 Chronic Wrist Pain  Arthrography  Wrist  \nOnce a scaphoid fracture is identified, Radiographic arthrography does not contribute to the evaluation for \ncomplications of the fracture.  \nVariant 12: Chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or nonspecific. Suspect carpal tunnel syndrome.  Next \nstudy. \nUS Wrist \nSeveral meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the \ncarpal  tunnel  inlet) is highly accurate for identifying carpal  tunnel syndrome  diagnosed clinically or with the \ncombination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US \nvaries depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the \nmeasurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary \nexamination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel \nsyndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal \ntunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, \nclinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of \ncarpal tunnel syndrome. US may be appropriate in cases where this initial evaluation is equivocal.  \nMRI Wrist  \nHistorically, carpal tunnel syndrome has been diagnosed based on clinical signs and sympt oms and confirmed by \nthe results of electrodiagnostic studies [67]. MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in cases in which this  \ninitial evaluation is equivocal. The MRI findings that have been reported in wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome \u2014\nincluding nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing\u2014may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value \nin patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68]. In rare cases of secondary carpal tunnel syndrome, MRI may identify \na mass lesion compressing the median nerve. There is some evidence that the length of T2 hyperintensity in the \nmedian nerve can help prognosticate the success of surgery [69] and that the shape and signal of the nerve predict \nclinical response to a steroid injection in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome [70 ]. MR neurography \nmay be an option in patients with suspected carpal tunnel syndrome.  The use o f IV contrast does not contribute to \ndiagnosis and is usually not appropriate.  \nMR Arthrography  Wrist  \nMR arthrography is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.  \nCT Wrist  \nCT, with or without IV  contrast, is not routinely used to diagnose carpa l tunnel syndrome.  \nCT Arthrography  Wrist  \nCT arthrography is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.  \nBone Scan  Wrist  \nBone scan is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.  \nArthrography  Wrist  \nRadiographic arthrography  is not routinely us ed to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome . \nSummary of Recommendations  \n\u2022 Wrist radiographs are indicated as the best initial imaging examination in patients with chronic wrist pain. \n\u2022 When radiographs are normal or equivocal and a patient has persistent symptoms wi th an unclear diagnosis, \nMRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate.  \n\u2022 In patients with suspected inflammatory arthritis, MRI either with or without IV contrast is usually \nappropriate if guidance for management or prognostication is needed.  \n\u2022 Patients with  suspected wrist infection should undergo aspiration.  \n\u2022 When radiographs are normal or equivocal in a patient with ulnar -sided pain, either MRI without IV contrast \nor an MR arthrogram of the wrist is usually appropriate.  \n\u2022 When radiographs are normal or equivocal in a patient with radial -sided pain, MRI without IV contrast is \nusually appropriate.", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 10 Chronic Wrist Pain  importantly, though, the finding of enhancing bone marrow \u201cedema\u201d (osteitis) on MRI studies in patients with \nearly RA is proving to be the best single predictor of future disease progression and functional dete rioration, even \ncompared to serologies and clinical measures [27, 28,32-34].  \nUS Wrist  \nThe diagnosis of a specific inflammatory arthritis is typically established based on clinical and laboratory \nanalysis. Advanced imaging is usually performed to determine disease activity, guide management decisions, and prognosticate outcomes. In patients with RA, US  of the wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints can  show \ninflammation  as active synovitis. Identifying active synovitis with power Doppler assessment is a useful adjunct \nin making an early diagnosis of RA when a pati ent with early arthritis does not meet the 2010 criteria established \nby the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism [20]. The presence of \nsynovitis predicts progression of erosions [31 ] and erosions themselves [35]. US can also depict small bone \nerosions with high spatial resolution; h owever, US is less sensitive to erosions that occur on the radial or ulnar \nsides of the inner carpal bones because direct scanning of these regions is blocked, unlike the dorsal and volar \nbone surfaces. Furthermore, unlike MRI, US cannot show changes within the bone marrow, which are  the \nstrongest prognosticator s for disease progression in RA [27, 28,32-34].  In patients with established inflammatory \narthritis who are undergoing therapy, judging progression or reduction of synovitis may be more difficult with \nsequential US compared to sequential MRI.  \nMR Arthrography  Wrist  \nMR arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected inflammatory \narthritides. \nCT Wrist  \nWhile CT is more sensitive than radiographs for erosions, CT is not routinely used for the diagnosis and \nmanagement of patients with suspected inflammatory arthritides . \nCT Arthrography  Wrist  \nCT arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected inflammatory \narthritides. \nBone Scan  Wrist  \nBone scan does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients  with suspected inflammatory \narthritides. \nArthrography  Wrist  \nRadiographic arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected \ninflammatory arthritides. \nVariant 4: Chronic wrist pain.

However, generalizing from experience with septic arthrit is in other joints, joint \naspiration should not be delayed in order to obtain advanced imaging studies. In cases of suspected septic arthritis, \npercutaneous aspiration of the wrist is indicated, even when radiographs appear normal. Aspirates should be \nanalyzed by cell count, gram stain, and appropriate cultures. Microscopic crystal analysis should also be obtained \nif there is a possibility of gout, acute pseudogout, or hydroxyapatite deposition disease. Aspiration can be \nperformed without imaging guidance i f the joint is distended, but either fluoroscopy or US  may be useful if a \nspecific compartment is to be targeted.  \nMRI Wrist  \nThere may be a role for MRI with IV contrast enhancement in the staging of infections (for example, to delineate the location and extent of soft-tissue abscesses)  after aspiration has been performed.  Especially in chronic cases, \nMRI with IV contrast may be useful to identify a fluid collection or joint effusion to target  for aspiration.  \nHowever, MRI is usually not appropriate as the next study after radiographs for suspected wrist infections.  \nMR Arthrography  Wrist  \nMR arthrography is not routinely used to evaluate suspected wrist infection.", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 7 Chronic Wrist Pain  CHRONIC WRIST PAIN\nExpert Panel on Musculoskeletal Imaging:  David A.

The choice of imaging modality depends on the patient\u2019s \npresentation and the clinical questions being asked. There are scenarios in which no imaging beyond baseline \nradiographs is necessary, but in other situations advanced imaging has added value for diagnostic eva luation and \ntreatment planning.  \nOverview of Imaging Modalities  \nRadiographs  \nImaging evaluation of the painful wrist should begin with radiog raphs [1,2]. This simple study may establish a \nspecific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, \nimpaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -\nanterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or \nmore oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling \n[3]. A v ariety of stress positions and maneuvers can be performed to elicit dynamic instability that is not visible \non standard radiographs [ 4]. Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. \nAdditionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ]. \nIn the past , fluoroscopic observation was used to establish the diagnosis of dynamic wrist inst ability. However, in \nmost practices,  fluoroscopy is used either for g uidance during wrist injections  or as an adjunct to arthrography.  \nPercutaneous aspiration of the wrist \u2014which is indicated in cases of suspected septic arthritis or to assess for intra-\narticular crystals\u2014can be carried out with either fluoroscopic or ultrasound (US) guidance  if needed . \nScintigraphy  \nBone scintigraphy has been used for diagnosing occult wrist fractures and as a screening procedure in patients \nwith wrist pain and negative radi ographs. However, while it is sensitive to bone abnormalities, scintigraphy \nsuffers from a lack of specificity [6 ]. Furthermore, bone scans cannot detect soft -tissue abnormalities  such as  \nlesions of the ligaments, tendons, and cartilage, all of which are often responsible for chronic wrist pain.  \nArthrography  \nConventional (x-ray) arthrography can be performed with contrast injection into the radiocarpal joint al one or into \nthe radiocarpal, mi dcarpal, and distal radioulnar joints ( 3-phase technique) for the diagnosis of triangular \nfibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tear and intrinsic ligament perforations. A recent meta -analysis found only \nmoderate pooled sensitivity (76%) for the detection of full -thickness TFCC tears (82% for 3 -phase technique and \n72% for single -injection arthrograms)  [7]. However, arthrography is unable to reliably show the size, shape, and \nstability of TFCC defects and is insensitive to partial-thickness tears. Similarly, while conventional arthrography can be used to diagnose full -thickness defects in the intrinsic intercarpal ligaments, it is unable to identify which \ncomponents of those ligaments are affected, to distinguish degenerative from traumatic lesions, to find partial-\nthickness ligament tears, to demonstrate abnormalities of the extrinsic ligaments, or to show extra-articular \n \naPrincipal Author,  Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri."], ["US Hand  \nDynamic US allows direct visualization of subluxation/dislocation of the extensor tendon while the patient flexes \nthe metacarpophalangeal joint [16,75]. \nUS helps evaluate injured flexor tendons and, in cases of completel y lacerated tendons,  helps identify the location \nof the proximal tendon stump [76].", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 4 Acute Hand and Wrist Trauma  ACUTE HAND AND WRIST TRAUMA\nExpert Panel on Musculoskeletal Imaging: Maha Torabi, MDa; Leon Lenchik, MDb; Francesca D.

Radiographs are usually sufficient for  the evaluation \nof osseous \u201cmallet\u201d injuries, which include bony avulsion at the insertion of the extensor mechanism of the finger \nto the distal interphalangeal joint [16]. In these injuries, involvement of more than one -third of the articular \nsurface usually requires operative fixation.  Palmar displacement of the distal phalanx or an interfragmentary gap \nof >3 mm is also an indication for surgery [ 16].

CT shows intra-articular extension of distal radius fractures more frequently than \nradiography.  Three-dimensional reconstructions can be particularly helpful in preoperative planning for complex \narticular injuries  [7,8]. \nCT should be used to exclude an occult fracture of the upper extremity.

Dynamic examination shows the relationship of the aponeurosis to the \nretracted ligament stump [65] . \nUS allows for diagnosis of pulley system injuries [ 66,67]. \nBone Scan Hand \nBone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  \nVariant 6: Initial radiographs showing metaca rpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, or distal \ninterphalangeal joint malalignment in the absence of fracture.

MRI may be used to assess \ncapsule and collateral ligament injuries of the proximal interphalangeal  and metacarpophalangeal joints [68]. \nFor flexor tendon injuries, Rubin et al [ 69] reported a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of  100% in cadavers.  \nDrap\u00e9 et al  [58] reported sensitivity and specificity of 100% for diagnosis of tendon re -tears after flexor tend on \nrepair and a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 100% for diagnosis of peritendinous adhesions in 63 injured \nfingers.  Jersey finger refers to avulsion injury of flexor digitorum profundus from  insertion at base of distal \nphalanx. In patients with jers ey finger, MRI is commonly used to evaluate the level of tendon retraction, the \nquality of the tendon stump, and the associated injuries including pulley injuries [16]. In clinically equivocal \ncases, MRI may demonstrate injury to the central slip or the extensor hood [ 16]. \nMRI allows for the assessment of pulley system lesions [ 66,67]. MRI can accurately depict the pulley system, \nparticularly the A2 and A4 pulleys, with lower sensitivity for A3 and A5 pulleys [ 70]. Hauger et al  [70] reported \ndirect identification of A2  and A4 pulleys in 12 of 12 cases (100%) and direct diagnosis of an abnormal A2 pulley \nin 100% and A4 pulley in 91% of 33 cases.  \nFor volar plat e injuries, MRI may be used to diagnose tears that do not involve the underlying bone [71]. This is \nimportant  because untreated lesions can result in contractures or joint laxity [ 72]. \nMRI of the extensor system has not been as well studied as that of the flexor system.  Drap\u00e9 et al [73] reported a \nsensitivity of 89 % to 92% for evaluation of normal sagittal bands of the extensor hood.  For the detection of \nextensor hood injuries, MRI sensitivity ranges from 28% to 85% [ 74]. \nMRI is especially useful for detection of ulnar collateral ligament and radial collateral ligament injuries.  \nPfirrmann et al [74] reported a sensitivity of 67% and a specificity of 91% for collateral ligament injuries of the \nlesser metacarpophalangeal joints. With MR arthrography, sensitivity and specificity increased to 75% and 98%, \nrespectively [74].", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 13 Chronic Wrist Pain  Variant 7: Chronic wrist pain.

Kransdorf, MD.n \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nIn patients with chronic wrist pain, imaging studies are  an important adjunct to history, physical examination, \nlaboratory testing, and electrophysiology studies. The choice of imaging modality depends on the patient\u2019s \npresentation and the clinical questions being asked. There are scenarios in which no imaging beyond baseline \nradiographs is necessary, but in other situations advanced imaging has added value for diagnostic eva luation and \ntreatment planning.  \nOverview of Imaging Modalities  \nRadiographs  \nImaging evaluation of the painful wrist should begin with radiog raphs [1,2]. This simple study may establish a \nspecific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, \nimpaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -\nanterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or \nmore oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling \n[3]. A v ariety of stress positions and maneuvers can be performed to elicit dynamic instability that is not visible \non standard radiographs [ 4]. Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. \nAdditionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ]. \nIn the past , fluoroscopic observation was used to establish the diagnosis of dynamic wrist inst ability. However, in \nmost practices,  fluoroscopy is used either for g uidance during wrist injections  or as an adjunct to arthrography.  \nPercutaneous aspiration of the wrist \u2014which is indicated in cases of suspected septic arthritis or to assess for intra-\narticular crystals\u2014can be carried out with either fluoroscopic or ultrasound (US) guidance  if needed . \nScintigraphy  \nBone scintigraphy has been used for diagnosing occult wrist fractures and as a screening procedure in patients \nwith wrist pain and negative radi ographs. However, while it is sensitive to bone abnormalities, scintigraphy \nsuffers from a lack of specificity [6 ]. Furthermore, bone scans cannot detect soft -tissue abnormalities  such as  \nlesions of the ligaments, tendons, and cartilage, all of which are often responsible for chronic wrist pain.  \nArthrography  \nConventional (x-ray) arthrography can be performed with contrast injection into the radiocarpal joint al one or into \nthe radiocarpal, mi dcarpal, and distal radioulnar joints ( 3-phase technique) for the diagnosis of triangular \nfibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tear and intrinsic ligament perforations. A recent meta -analysis found only \nmoderate pooled sensitivity (76%) for the detection of full -thickness TFCC tears (82% for 3 -phase technique and \n72% for single -injection arthrograms)  [7]. However, arthrography is unable to reliably show the size, shape, and \nstability of TFCC defects and is insensitive to partial-thickness tears. Similarly, while conventional arthrography can be used to diagnose full -thickness defects in the intrinsic intercarpal ligaments, it is unable to identify which \ncomponents of those ligaments are affected, to distinguish degenerative from traumatic lesions, to find partial-\nthickness ligament tears, to demonstrate abnormalities of the extrinsic ligaments, or to show extra-articular \n \naPrincipal Author,  Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri.", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 6 Acute Hand and Wrist Trauma  Like CT, MRI shows intra -articular extension of distal radius fractures more frequently than radiography.  Unlike \nCT, MRI shows concomitant ligament  injuries, including tears of the scapholunate ligament, which may affect \nsurgical treatment [26,27]. Despite these advantages,  MRI performed immediately at the time of injury has little \nadded value for determining which patients go on to surgery [ 23]. \nMRI is especially useful in evaluating  hand soft -tissues injuries, including the collateral ligaments, volar plates, \ntendons, and pulleys. For metacarpal and digital fractures, MRI is usually not indicated during acute injury [ 22]. \nThere is no evidence to support the use of MRI with IV contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist trauma.  \nUS Area of Interest  \nUS may have a limited utility  for evaluating bone injuries. Christiansen et al  [28] reported 47% sensitivity and \n61% specificity of US  for the detection of scaphoid fractures . They concluded that US  is not suitable for the early \ndiagnosis of scaphoid fracture.  In contrast, Hauger et al  [29] reported that using cortical disruption as a diagnostic \ncriterion on US is an accurate sign for detecting occult fractures of the scaphoid waist. Further study of US  for the \ndiagnosis of occult fractures is needed . \nBone Scan Area of  Interest  \nBone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  \nVariant 3: Acute wrist fracture on radiographs. Suspect wrist tendon or ligament trauma. Next imaging \nstudy. \nRadiography Wrist  \nAssessment of carpal instability with conventional radiographs requires careful attention to radiographic \npositioning.  In low -grade injuries, radiographs are usually normal.  Scapholunate diastasis of >4 mm and dorsal til t \nof the lunate of > 10\u00b0 suggests dorsal intercalated segmental instability  [30,31]. Lunotriquetral dias tasis with \nscapholunate angle < 30\u00b0 and capitolunate angle of > 30\u00b0 suggests volar intercalated segmental instability  [30]. \nCT Arthrography  Wrist  \nWhen conventional radiographs do not show carpal malalignment, CT arthrography may be used to diagnose \nligamentous tears,  causing dynamic instability [ 32,33]. There is a g rowing body of literature comparing the \ndiagnostic accuracy of MR I (at 1.5T or 3T), MR arthrography (indirect or direct at 1.5T  or 3T) , and CT \narthrography.  Overall , CT arthrography is reported to have the highest sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.  \nFor the detection of scapholunate ligament tear, CT arthrography has sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of \nnearly 100%.  For the detection of lunotriquetral ligament tear, CT arthrography has approximately 100% \nsensitivity, 80% specificity, and 90% accuracy.  Compared with arthroscopy, CT arthrography has 80%  to 100% \nsensitivity for scapholunate and lunotriquetral ligament tears [ 33-35 ]. \nCompared to MR arthrography,  CT arthrography detects partial ligament tears more accurately, detects articular \ncartilage defects more accurately, and has greater interobserver agreement [ 33]. Both CT arthrography and MR \narthrography have a very high accuracy for diagnosing tears of the scapholunate ligament and lunotriquetral \nligament; both are more  accurate than conventional MRI [ 36]. \nThe accuracy of CT arthrography for extrinsic ligament injuries is unknown [ 37]. \nCT Wrist  \nCT is not indicated in this clinical setting. \nMRI Wrist  \nWhen conventional radiographs do not show carpal malalignment, MRI is commonly used to diagnose \nligamentous tears.

Kransdorf,  MD.o  \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nFractures of the proximal femur (commonly referred to as hip fractures)  are a frequent  source of morbidity and \nmortality in elderly osteoporotic patients [1]. Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type \nresult in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men \n[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs \nwill continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of \nlife following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays \nin diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -\nand long-term mortality [6-13]. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of hip fractures is critical. Hip fractures \ncannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded on the basis of physical exam ination  alone ; therefore , imaging plays a \nkey role in early  and accurate diagnosis [14] . \nThe biomechanics of proximal femoral and pelvic fractures that are a result of major trauma differs as these \ninjuries may be seen in any age group, often with additional accompanying high-velocity injuri es of the abdomen \nand pelvis . Motor vehicle \u2013related trauma is the most common  mechanism. Thorough evaluation of the hip may be \nsuperseded  in these instances by the need for resuscitation and diagnosis and treatment of more urgent associated \nvascular or solid organ injuries. Imaging plays an important role not only in the diagnosis of high-velocity \nfractures but also in characterizing fracture mechanism and morphology for treatment planning purposes.  \nHowever, imaging of high-velocity hip fractures occurs in the context of a broader trauma evaluation. A full \ndiscussion of the broader imaging workup of blunt trauma is beyond the scope of this paper and will be covered in \nthe upcoming ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae titled \u201cMajor Blunt Trauma\u201d and will be made available on the \nACR website  when completed . \nTreatment  for both intra - and extracapsular proximal femoral fractures in the elderly is typically surgical fixation  \nbecause of the risk of further fracture displacement and the dangers of prolonged immobilization in the elderly \n[15]. Joint replacement may be  performed for displaced fractures of the femoral neck where the risk of femoral \nhead avascular necrosis is high. Fractures from high -force trauma are also commonly treated with surgical \nfixation for stability to reduce the risk of post -traumatic osteo arthritis. \nDiscussion of Procedures by Variant  \nVariant 1:  Acute hip pain. Fall or minor trauma. Suspect fracture. Initial imaging.  \nRadiography Hip \nRadiography is the initial imaging modality of choice for assessment of acute hip pain with suspected fracture , \nwith the more advanced imaging modalities reserved for instances of clinically suspected fracture in the setting of \nnegative or equivocal radiographs. Radiographs are rapidly obtained and well tolerated by patients. When a \nfracture is demonstrated , freque ntly no more imaging is needed for treatment planning purposes [15 -17].", "ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 10 Chronic  Hip Pain Radiography Hip Additional Views \nFor further evaluation  of disorders  such as dysplasia or FAI, specialized  views such as the false  profile  or elongated  \nfemoral  neck  lateral  (Dunn)  views  can provide  more  detailed  evaluation  of the anatomy  of the femoral  head  and \nneck  and the degree of acetabular  coverage of the femoral  head  [47]. \nUS Hip \nIn general,  US is limited  in its use for evaluating  osseous structures.  However,  there is limited  literature  that \ndemonstrates that US can be used to evaluate osseous features of FAI such as the alpha -angle  [73]. However,  US is \nnot able to adequately  evaluate osseous abnormalities  deep  to the cortex.  One of the advantages  of US is its ability  \nto dynamically  evaluate for extra-articular  soft tissue  impingement.  US is not as sensitive as MRI or CT \narthrography  for the detection  of labral  tears  [17], but it can be useful  for the detection  and localization  of paralabral  \ncysts for aspiration  and injection  [39,41] . \nVariant  4: Chronic  hip pain.

Next imaging \nstudy. \nMRI Pelvis and Affected Hip \nThere is considerable literature regarding the use of noncontrast MRI for the detection of radiographically occult \nproximal femoral fractures. An early study by Quinn et al  [37] found MRI to be 100% accurate for fracture \ndetection in patients with indeterminate radiographs using clinical outcomes as the gold standard. A s ubsequent \nstudy by Pandey et  al [38] found no missed fractures in 10 of 33 patients with negative MRIs , all of whom were \nfollowed clinically for at least 6 mo nths. A 2008 study showed 99% sensitivity of MRI, both for proximal femoral \nfractures and fractures of the pelvis [39] . With multiple studies indicating near 100% sensitivity for proximal \nfemoral fracture, it has been suggested that a negative MRI may allow for confident discharge from the \nemergency department and reduce the number of cautionary admissions [23,29] . Conversely, rapid diagnosis of \nsurgical fractures reduces delay to treatment  with associated improved  outcomes [10]. \nSeveral additional studies have also shown  high diagnostic a ccuracy for diagnosis of both pelvis fractures and \nsoft-tissue injuries in addition to fractures of the proximal femur [28,30,39] . This versatility is important as many \nseries have shown a high incidence of extrafemoral trauma in patients with acute hip pain and negative \nradiographs. For exampl e, in the study by Ohishi et al  [30], of 113 patients , 38% had fractures of the proximal \nfemur and 33% had fractures of t he pelvis.  In another retrospective series, Dominguez et al  [21] found pelvic \nfractures to be more common than proximal femur fractures in this patient population,  emphasizing the \nimportance of accuracy in the assessment of extrafem oral trauma . Although many of these pelvic fractures and \nsoft-tissue injuries may not be treated surgically , correct diagnosis allows for appropriate conservative treatment , \nincluding protected weight -bearing, pain  control, deep vein thrombosis  prophylaxis, and skilled rehabilitation.  \nIn addition to its increased sensitivity for fracture detection, MRI has been shown to be useful in characterizing \nfracture morpholog y. Seemingly isolated fractures of the greater trochanter diagnosed on radiography frequent ly \nhave intertrochanteric extension when evaluated with MRI [22]. In a classic stud y of 30 patients, Schultz et al  \n[40] demonstrated the use of MRI to accurately depict the extent of the fracture line in these radiographically \noccult intertrochanteric fractures. There is an increasing trend to treat  incomplete intertrochanteric fractur es \nconservatively . For example,  in a s mall s eries of 8 patients, Alam et al  [41] found that of the 5 patients treated \nconservatively, none went on to complete their fracture."], ["The results of the pelvic  radiograph can help the clinician  for the selection  of additional  imaging  \ntechniques  and for comparison  with studies such as MRI,  CT, radionuclide  bone  scans,  and fluoride  PET [13-15].", "Measurements can be performed  on radiography,  CT, and MRI [42-44,47,48] .

Kransdorf,  MD.o  \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nFractures of the proximal femur (commonly referred to as hip fractures)  are a frequent  source of morbidity and \nmortality in elderly osteoporotic patients [1]. Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type \nresult in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men \n[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs \nwill continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of \nlife following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays \nin diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -\nand long-term mortality [6-13]. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of hip fractures is critical. Hip fractures \ncannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded on the basis of physical exam ination  alone ; therefore , imaging plays a \nkey role in early  and accurate diagnosis [14] . \nThe biomechanics of proximal femoral and pelvic fractures that are a result of major trauma differs as these \ninjuries may be seen in any age group, often with additional accompanying high-velocity injuri es of the abdomen \nand pelvis . Motor vehicle \u2013related trauma is the most common  mechanism. Thorough evaluation of the hip may be \nsuperseded  in these instances by the need for resuscitation and diagnosis and treatment of more urgent associated \nvascular or solid organ injuries. Imaging plays an important role not only in the diagnosis of high-velocity \nfractures but also in characterizing fracture mechanism and morphology for treatment planning purposes.  \nHowever, imaging of high-velocity hip fractures occurs in the context of a broader trauma evaluation. A full \ndiscussion of the broader imaging workup of blunt trauma is beyond the scope of this paper and will be covered in \nthe upcoming ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae titled \u201cMajor Blunt Trauma\u201d and will be made available on the \nACR website  when completed . \nTreatment  for both intra - and extracapsular proximal femoral fractures in the elderly is typically surgical fixation  \nbecause of the risk of further fracture displacement and the dangers of prolonged immobilization in the elderly \n[15]. Joint replacement may be  performed for displaced fractures of the femoral neck where the risk of femoral \nhead avascular necrosis is high. Fractures from high -force trauma are also commonly treated with surgical \nfixation for stability to reduce the risk of post -traumatic osteo arthritis. \nDiscussion of Procedures by Variant  \nVariant 1:  Acute hip pain. Fall or minor trauma. Suspect fracture. Initial imaging.  \nRadiography Hip \nRadiography is the initial imaging modality of choice for assessment of acute hip pain with suspected fracture , \nwith the more advanced imaging modalities reserved for instances of clinically suspected fracture in the setting of \nnegative or equivocal radiographs. Radiographs are rapidly obtained and well tolerated by patients. When a \nfracture is demonstrated , freque ntly no more imaging is needed for treatment planning purposes [15 -17].", "ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 10 Chronic  Hip Pain Radiography Hip Additional Views \nFor further evaluation  of disorders  such as dysplasia or FAI, specialized  views such as the false  profile  or elongated  \nfemoral  neck  lateral  (Dunn)  views  can provide  more  detailed  evaluation  of the anatomy  of the femoral  head  and \nneck  and the degree of acetabular  coverage of the femoral  head  [47]. \nUS Hip \nIn general,  US is limited  in its use for evaluating  osseous structures.  However,  there is limited  literature  that \ndemonstrates that US can be used to evaluate osseous features of FAI such as the alpha -angle  [73]. However,  US is \nnot able to adequately  evaluate osseous abnormalities  deep  to the cortex.  One of the advantages  of US is its ability  \nto dynamically  evaluate for extra-articular  soft tissue  impingement.  US is not as sensitive as MRI or CT \narthrography  for the detection  of labral  tears  [17], but it can be useful  for the detection  and localization  of paralabral  \ncysts for aspiration  and injection  [39,41] . \nVariant  4: Chronic  hip pain. Suspect  labral tear.  Radiographs  negative  or nondiagnostic. Next  imaging  \nstudy. \nBone  Scan  Hip \nThere is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of bone  scan of the hip for the workup of an acetabular  labral  tear \nin a patient  with chronic  hip pain.  \nCT Arthrography  Hip \nSome  authors  have  shown  that CT arthrography  can be useful  in the detection  of acetabular  labral  tears [17,74] , \nwhich  may be associated  with FAI, but other  authors  have  shown  that CT arthrography is not very good for the \ndetection  of labral  tears [18].  \nCT Hip With  IV Contrast  \nThere is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of CT hip with IV contrast  for the workup  of an acetabular  labral  \ntear in a patient  with chronic  hip pain.  \nCT Hip Without  and With  IV Contrast  \nThere is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of CT hip without and with IV contrast  for the workup  of an \nacetabular  labral  tear in a patient  with chronic  hip pain.  \nCT Hip Without  IV Contrast  \nBecause of  its inherent  poor contrast  resolution,  there  is no relevant  literature  support ing the use of CT hip without  \nIV contrast  for the workup of an acetabular  labral  tear in a patient  with chronic  hip pain.  \nFluoride  PET/CT Skull Base to Mid-Thigh \nThere is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of fluoride  PET/CT skull base to mid-thigh in the evaluation  of \nchronic  hip pain thought  to be due to a labral  tear. \nImage -Guided Anesthetic +/- Corticosteroid  Injection  Hip Joint  or Surrounding  Structures  \nDiagnostic joint injections  are safe and useful  tools  for confirming  the etiology  of pain, such as a labral  tear or \nsymptomatic  paralabral  cyst [20-22]. \nMR Arthrography  Hip \nDirect  MR arthrography,  with the intraarticular  injection  of a 1:200 solution  of gadolinium  chelate in saline,  has \nbeen  established  as a reliable  technique  for diagnosing acetabular  labral  tears [75-80]  that are frequently  associated  \nwith FAI [81,82] . MR arthrography has been  shown  to have  a sensitivity  of 94.5%  and a specificity  of 100%  for \nthe detection  of labral  tears [52].", "Altho ugh the technology holds promise, diagnostic accuracy does not yet \napproach that of MRI , with an  initial study by Reddy et al [49] demonstrating a sensitivity of 90% and specificity \nof 40% for nondisplaced femoral neck fractures . However, this may be a modality of emerging imp ortance as \ntechnology improves.  \nUS Hip \nThe use of US  for evaluation of the acutely painful hip has been evaluated in a single study of 10 patients  with hip \nfractures [36]. Although US was able to identify trauma-related changes,  such as joint effusion , with 100% \nsensitivity , specificity for fracture reached only 65%. The authors acknowledged that performance might further \ndecrease for examinations performed by sonographers and radiologists not experienced with musculoskeletal US . \nFor this document , it is assumed the procedure is performed and interpreted by an expert.  Given the inability of \nUS to comprehensively evaluate the bones and soft  tissues of the pelvis, there is not enough evidence to support \nthe role of US  in the workup of radiographically occult hip fracture.", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 3 Acute Hip Pain -Suspected Fracture  same study , Naqvi et al [18] did find that the cross -table lateral view changed treatment decisions in several \npatients and conceded that the cross-table lateral view remains valuable for improving overall sensitivity of \nradiographs, assessing femoral shaft extension, and assessing potentially pathologic fractures. The frog -leg view \nhas been disc ouraged in patients with suspected fractures given concern that the required patient positioning will \nlead to further fracture displacement [15,17] . One small retrospective study evaluated the benefit of an oblique AP \nview with 30 \u00b0 of lateral tube angulation to better profile the femoral neck , but this led to only a small increase in \nsensitivity and , in some cases,  resulted in obscuration of the femoral neck by the posterior wall of the acetabulum \n[19]. Thus,  standard AP and cross-table lateral views have remained  the mainstay for trauma a ssessment of the \nhip. \nMultiple studies have demonstrated that radiographs have limited sensitivity for fracture detection of the proximal \nfemur, particularly in elderly osteoporotic patients [20-24]. All of these studies constitute retrospective series in \nwhich patients with negative radiographs but high clinical suspicion went on to receive a MRI scan at the \ndiscretion of the evaluating clinician. In one such study, 14% of patients with negative rad iographs were found to \nhave fractures of the hip or pelvis  [23]. In this same study, Kirby et al  [23] also reported 12% of patients with \nsuspicious radiographs were found to have no fracture on MRI , illustrating limitations in the specificity of \nradiographs as well. Other studies have had more dra matic results,  with Sankey et al  [25] reporting 83 of 98 \npatients to have fractures after negative radiographs, 23 of whom required operative management . The variability  \nis likely due to differing proportions of patients going on to MRI following negative radiographs in these \nretrospective studies.  However , there is no accepted clinical decision rule to guide when patients with suspected \nhip fracture should have advanced imaging after negative radiographs. A new inability to bear weight is a \nclinically suspicious finding , although the sensitivity and specificity of this is unknown  [20]. Allowing for \nvariation between studies, the estimated prev alence of occult fracture after negative radiographs has  been \nestimated  at 4% to 10% , indicating the inability of negative radiographs alone to exclude fracture [21,26] . Risk \nfactors for radiographically occult fracture in these studies included those age >65, low -force trauma,  such as a \nground-level fall , and female gender. These studies have almost exclusively included elderly patients.  There is no \nrelevant literature regarding the sensitivity and specificity of radiographs in the younger patient population,  and \nclinicians are suggested to proceed with caution.  \nRadiography Pelvis  \nThere is no specific literature  regarding the use of an AP view of the pelvis  alone  for acute hip pain following \nlow-force trauma.  Previous literature regarding the accuracy of radiography has almost exclusively evaluated AP \nand cross-table lateral radiographs of the hip or the combined use of AP pelvis and hip radiographs. However, i t is \nwell established that patients with clinically  suspected proximal femur fracture often have fractures of the pelvis,  \nincluding the sacrum and pubic rami [21,27-30] . Therefore , it has been  recommended that the radiographic series \ninclude the AP view of the pelvis along with the orthogonal  views  of the symptomatic hip [31] . The inclusion of a \npelvis radiograph also allows for comparison of potential abnormalities to the contralateral asymptomatic side.  \nPelvis radiographs share the same limitations in sensitivity  and specificity  for fracture detection as hip \nradiographs , and a negative radiograph alone cannot exclude fracture . \nRadiography Pelvis and Hip \nAs previously discussed, p atients with clinically suspected proximal femur fracture often have fractures of the \npelvis  that includ e the sacrum and pubic rami [21,27- 30]. Moreover, these pelvic fractures may occur in isolation \nor concomitant with a fracture of the proximal femur [28].", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 5 Acute Hip Pain -Suspected Fracture  difficulty of older patients in tolerating  long scan times, there continues to be interest in developing rapid and \naccurate MRI protocols.  \nWith the diagnostic accuracy of noncontrast MRI approaching 100%, there has been little need to explore the \naddition of IV  gadolinium contrast solely for the purposes of fracture detection. Rather , the interest has been in \nthe use of dynamic MRI to evaluate femoral head perfusion for prognostic purpose to estimate the risks of \nimpaired perfusion,  such as osteonecrosis and non union. In one study of 36 patients, impaired femoral head \nperfusion was mor e common in patients with displaced fractures,  although there was considerable overlap of \nperfusion pattern and fracture type [44]. The accuracy of predicting successful osseous union was 75% based on \nfracture morphology and improved incrementally to 89% on the basis of perfusion dynamics. Only 2 of 16 \npatients with nondisplaced fractures had osteonecrosis. A study from 2009 had similar results with  90% accuracy \nfor prediction of successful fracture union on the basis of femoral head perfusion [45]. However, the study \nidentified on ly 1 patient with a nondisplaced fracture with impaired femoral head perfusion and did not specify \nwhether this patient went on to osteonecrosis, nor was the accuracy of predicting osteonecrosis on the basis of \nfemoral head perfusion compared to that of the well -established Garden classification system. Given these \nfindings, it is not clear if contrast-enhanced MRI offers significant advantages in the evaluation of the fractured \nhip compared to existing classification systems.  \nCT Pelvis and Hips  \nCT has advantages over MRI in terms of speed as well as use in patients with significant confusion. There has \nbeen considerable investigation into the accuracy  of noncontrast CT for detection of radiographically occult \nproximal femoral fractures,  although these studies have been invariably retrospective in nature, have used \ninconsistent methodology, and at times produced conflicting results . In one study of 199 patients, CT was \nnegative  for fracture  in 93 patients,  and none were found to have undiscovered f ractures at 4 -month clinical \nfollow -ups [34]. Another similar study with 68 patients  found no missed fractures in 27 patients with negative CT \nscans,  although it was not clear if clin ical follow -up was as comprehensive [46]. However, a number of other \nstudies have demonstrated potential limitations in the sensitivity of CT. For example, Haubro et al [26] found a \nsensitivity for CT of 87% compared with 100% for MRI , with CT missing 6 of 15 fractures . Another larger study \nof 129 cases compared MRI and CT for the diagnosis of both proximal femoral and pelvic fractures and found a \nsensitivity of 99% for MRI and 69% for CT using clinical outcomes and follow -up imaging as the gold standard \n[39]. This same study by Cabarrus et al  [39] also found MRI to be substantially better at detecting soft -tissue  \nabnormalities with 99% sensitivity for MRI and 13% sensitivity edema , and the differences in sensitivity for  more \nsignificant injuries , such as hematoma or tendon avulsion,  may be somewhat less. Several  other similar studies \ncomparing CT and MRI have also shown decreased sensitivity of CT with  potential for missed fractures as well as \nchanges in diagnosis and management when MRI is obtained after CT [24,47,48] . \nThere is no relevant data to support the use of contrast -enhanced CT solely for the purpose of fracture detection \nfollowing negative radiographs . However, if contrast -enhanced CT examination of the abdomen and pelvis is \nperformed because of suspicion of concurrent intra -abdominal trauma, bone algorithm  reconstruction of the pelvis \nand hips may be performed rather than performing a separate examination.  \nThere is no relev ant data to support the use of multiphase CT for the detection of fractures of the pelvis and \nproximal femur.  \nDual -energy CT is a more recent technology that has the ability to produce virtual noncalcium images for the \ndetection of bone marrow edema."], ["ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 10 Acute Trauma to the Ankle  Rare pantalar dislocations without associated talar or other fracture can be assessed on CT or MRI and have high \nrates of osteonecrosis, osteoarthritis, and infection  [71]. \nMRI Ankle  \nMRI is the reference standard for ligamentous injury and assessment of stability , which is particularly important in \nathletes, in whom determination of grade (1, 2,  or 3) of syndesmotic ligament, anterior tibiofibular ligament , and \ndeltoid injuries is critica l for treatment planning and return to sport assessment [51] . \nLigamentous injuries can occur without fracture on radiography. Grossterlinden et al  [52] compared MRI and \nradiography and showed that 15% of ligamentous injuries (including sprains, partial tears, and complete tears) at \nthe syndesmosis in acute ankle injuries on M RI demonstra ted no fracture on radiography.  \nRare pantalar dislocations without associated talar or other fracture can be assessed on CT or MRI and have high \nrates of osteonecrosis, osteoarthritis, and infection  [71]. \nRadiography Ankle Stress Views  \nStress radiograph s may be useful in assessing syndesmotic instability, particularly in supination external rotation \nankle injuries according to the Lauge -Hansen classification. Lee et al [72]  noted that tibiotalar tilt angle and anterior \ntibiofibular space measurements were affected when the anterior tibiofibular and posterior talofibular ligaments \nwere injured (confirmed on MRI) in 299 patients . Lateral stress testing with widening of the tibiofibular clear space \nhas been shown to be  an indicator of syndesmotic injury , with the traditional external rotation stress test shown to \nbe a poor indicator when t he deltoid ligament is injured [73] . \nRadiography Leg \nMaisonneuve fracture (syndesmotic injury of the ankle in combination with a proximal fibular fracture) may be \noverlooked as a result of  lack of pain at the fibula. Careful palpation of the proximal fibula should be performed \nwith radiographic evaluation of the entire tibia and fibular if focal tenderness is present [74] . \nUS Ankle  \nUS is not typically the next line of evaluation  of syndesmotic injuries. Although some studies have suggested \nfocused US could be beneficial for ligamentous evaluation, others have shown limited utility in lateral ankle \nligament spr ains [75]. \nSummary of Recommendations  \nVariant 1: Ankle radiographs are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of patients 5 years of age or older with \nacute trauma to the ankle or acute trauma to the ankle with persistent pain for more than 1 week but less than 3 \nweeks with no exclusionar y criteria present and the OAR  are positive : 1. Inability to bear weight immediately after \nthe injury, OR  2. Point tenderness over the medial malleolus, the posterior edge or inferior tip of the lateral \nmalleolus, talus, or calcaneus, OR  3. Inability to ambulate for 4 steps in the emergency department.  \nVariant 2: Imaging is usually not appropriate for patients 5 years of age or older with a cute trauma to the ankle \nwhen the patient is able  to walk  and there are no exclusionary criteria present (eg, neurologically intact (includ ing \nno peripheral neuropathy )) and  the OAR  are negative: No point tenderness over the malleoli, talus, or calcaneus on \nphysical examination.  \nVariant 3: Ankle radiographs are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of patients 5 ye ars of age or older  with \nacute trauma to the ankle when exclusionary criteria are present (eg, neurologic disorder, neuropathy, or other) and \nthe patient does not meet requirements for evaluation by the OAR . \nVariant 4: MRI ankle without IV contrast or CT a nkle without IV contrast  are usually appropriate  for patients 5 \nyears of age or older with acute trauma to the ankle with persistent pain for more than 1 week but less than 3 weeks \nthat had negative initial radiographs and no exclusionary criteria are present.", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 9 Acute Trauma to the Ankle  fracture talus, also known as the  LIFT lesion) can occur after twisting injury to the ankle.  Initial radiographs should \nbe followed by CT  and MR I [60,61] . These lesions are treated successfully with combined open approach and \narthroscop y. \nFractures  \nCT is the first -line imaging  study  after radiographs to determine extent, displacement , comminution, intra -articular \nextension , associated injuries,  and potential classification of fractures [48] . This is particularly important in subtalar, \ncalcaneal,  and talar fractures because of  the complex anatomy and in high -impact polytrauma or complex \ncomminuted injuries in which multiplanar CT imaging is recommended to help direct the preoperative planning \nevaluation process [62]. \nMRI Ankle  \nOsteochondral lesions  \nMRI without  IV contrast is co nsidered the study of choice for assessment of cartilage abnormalities and bone \ncontusions related to acquired  osteochondral lesion,  particularly in patients with symptoms of persistent pain, \nstiffness, locking, clicking , and ankle swelling  [22,55-57,63] . Although radiographs and CT depict ossific fragments \nand fracture lines, cartilage abnormalities and bone contusions related to osteochondral lesion are best seen on MRI. \nSeventy percent  of ankle fractures and 50% of ankle sprains have been shown to result in some variation of cartilage \ninjury [57,58,61,64] . \nFractures  \nAlthough CT is more commonly used as the next step in fracture assessment in  known fractures, MRI can be useful \nas a follow-up imaging modality for assessment of associated bone marrow contusions, stress injuries,  or fractures \n[65]. MRI is especially important in fracture sites such as the talus,  which are at higher risk for osteonecrosis. MR I \nis highly accurate for associated soft -tissue abnormalities including tendon entrapment/dislocation and for \nligamentous inju ries [66]. \nRadiography Ankle Broden\u2019s View  \nThe Broden view is a supine  flexed knee view with 30 \u00b0 to 45\u00b0 internal rotation that  can be used  for specific improved \nevaluation of the lateral process fracture of the talus (commonly known as snowboarder\u2019s fracture). It may be of \nuse when further evaluation of the talar fracture is needed.  \nUS Ankle  \nOsteochondra l lesion  \nUS is not the next step in this clinical scenario.  \nFractures  \nUS has been shown to be useful for identification of lateral malleolar, medial malleolar , and fifth metatarsal \nfractures [41] but is not conside red a first -line assessment tool  or next imaging study  in this clinical scenario.  \nVariant 6 : Adult or child 5 years of age or older. Acute trauma to the ankle. Radiographs negative for osseous \ninjury and physical examination or radiographs demonstrate alignment abnormality  suggesting \nsyndesmotic/ligamentous injury or dislocation. Next study. \nLateral sprain is more common than medial strain , with the anterior talofibular ligament most commonly tor n. High \nsprain and fractures are more common in high -collision sport injuries [60], with higher incidence of ankle injuries \nduring winter months [67] and increased incidence in military recruits [68]. Inversion injuries of the ankle account \nfor 25% of musculoskeletal system injuries and 50% of all sports -related injuries [1].  \nBone Scan Ankle  \nBone scan is not routinely the next line of imaging in this clinical scenario.  \nCT Ankle  \nCT is useful for evaluation of dislocation and can be used to detect  syndesmotic injuries, although MRI is better for \nsoft-tissue evaluation. Nault et al [69]  validated CT scan measurement s that  can identify syndesmotic injuries seen \non MRI (retrosp ective study of MRI and CT) as a result of  modification of distal tibiofibular relationship after a \nmild syndesmotic injury.", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 8 Acute Trauma to the Ankle  dislocation, with fractures involving the posterior facet, with associated massive swelling, or with  failure to regain \nsubtalar motion after a period of immobilizat ion [49]. \nCT with IV contrast is not ind icated in this scenario because soft-tissue abnormalities and fluid collections can be \nidentified on noncontr ast high -resolution CT studies. \nMRI Ankle  \nMRI of the ankle without IV contrast is most sensitive for evaluation of occult fractures with associated bone \nmarrow edema patterns, particularly in inversion injuries and persistent lateral ankle pain, as well  as presence and \nextent of soft -tissue injuries  [29]. Stress injuries of bone , including those of the weekend warrior , are best depicted \nby MRI  [50]. \nMRI is the reference standard for ligamentous injury and assessment of stability , which is particularly important in \nathletes, in whom determination of grade ( 1, 2, or 3) of syndesmotic ligament, anterior tibiofibular ligament , and \ndeltoid injuries is critical for treatment planning and return to sport assessment [51]. High -resolution evaluation of \nthe tendons and ligaments allows distinction between tendinopathy, sprain, and partial or complete tears.  \nLigament and tendon  injuries can occur without fracture on radiography . Gross terlinden et al [52] compared MR I \nand radiography and showed that 15% of ligamentous injuries ( including sprains , partial tears, and complete tears) \nat the syndesmosis in acute ankle injuries on MRI demonstrated no fracture on radiography. Presence o f bone bruise \nand adjacent soft -tissue edema have shown a higher association with acute ligamentous injuries ( anterior talofibular \nligament most common) and tendon abnormalities [53,54]  in patients with negative radiographs.  MRI can also help \nexclude Salter 1 fractures in the pediatric population [55]. \nRadiography Ankle  \nRepeat radiograph s are not typically the next study but may be of use to identify early callous formation at an occult \nfracture line or possible mineralization at a site of intramuscular hematoma if contusion occurred during trauma. \nRadiographs with better technique may assist in diagnosis of subtle injuries such as the lateral talar process avulsion , \nwhich  may erroneously be diagnosed as  a lateral ankle sprain  [37]. \nRadiography Ankle Stress Views  \nAlthough ankle stress views are not the typical next best study for this patient group, if  there is clinical evidence of \ninstability on physician maneuvers, ankle stress views may be of benefit for identification of occult avulsion injury \nat ligamentous attachments that may contribute t o widening of the joint spac e on radiographic stress views.  \nUS Ankle  \nUS is not typically  the next imaging study . US may be useful as a secondary evaluation modality for focuse d \nevaluation of underlying soft -tissue injuries  and ligaments, with the added benefit of dynamic imaging. This \nincludes f ocused high-resolution US of the peroneal tendons and th e superior peroneal retinaculum  [56], stress US \n(during anterior drawer) to assess joint laxity or chondral avulsion fra ctures associated with lateral ligament injury \nin children with negative radiographs [57,58] , and potential detection of superficial occult fractures at the base of \nthe fifth metatarsal, lateral malleolus,  and malleolus [41] . \nVariant  5: Adult or child 5 years of age or older. Acute trauma to the ankle. No exclusionary criteria present. \nRadiographs demonstrate fracture or potential osteochondral injury. Next study.  \nBone Scan Ankle  \nOsteochondral lesions  \nBone scan is not the next imaging study in this clinical scenario.  \nFractures  \nBone scan is not the next imaging study in this clinical scenario. Bone scan may be used in rare setting in polytrauma \ncases for evaluation of multiple fractures.  \nCT Ankle  \nOsteoch ondral lesions  \nAlthough MRI is the reference standard, CT is also of utility to identify, locate, and quantify cortical and subcortical \ninvolvement or loss  as well as presence of intra -articular ossific bodies or associated fractures.", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 5 Acute Trauma to the Ankle  possible cautionary or exclusionary scenarios include pregnancy, penetrating trauma, or presence of prior recent \noutside radiographs on transfer.  \nSpecial Imaging Considerations  \nAvoidance of manipulation of the  ankle prior to radiographs in the absence of neurovascular deficit or critical skin \ninjury is recommended in order to avoid remanipulation or complication in this setting [27].  Advances in MRI \ntechnology have facilitated short dedicated extremity MRI protocols in so me centers that may be used as an \nemergent adjunct to radiographs  [28]. \nInitial Imaging Definition \nImaging at the beginning of the care episode for the medical condition defined by the variant. More than one \nprocedure can be considered usually appropriate in the initial imaging evaluation when:  \n\u2022 There are procedures that are equivalent alternatives (ie,  only one procedure will be ordered to \nprovide the clinical information to effectively manage the patient\u2019s care)  \nOR \n\u2022 There are complementary procedures (ie, more than one procedure is ordered as a set or \nsimultaneously in which  each procedure provides uniq ue clinical information to effectively manage \nthe patient\u2019s care).  \nDiscussion of Procedures by Variant  \nVariant 1: Adult or child 5 years of age or older. Acute trauma to the ankle or acute trauma to the ankle \nwith persistent pain for more than 1 week but less than 3 weeks. No exclusionary criteria present. Initial \nimaging. Patient meets the requirements for evaluation by the Ottawa Ankle Rules which are positive:  \n1. Inability to bear weight immediately after the injury, OR  \n2. Point tenderness over the medial mall eolus, the posterior edge or inferior tip of the lateral malleolus, \ntalus, or calcaneus, OR  \n3. Inability to ambulate for 4 steps in the emergency department.  \nBone Scan Ankle  \nBone scan is not routinely used as the first imaging study for the evaluation of acute trauma to the ankle with \npositive OAR.  \nCT Ankle   \nAlthough CT may be used in polytrauma patients to determine the extent of injury in complex fractures, CT is not \nroutinely used as the first imaging study of acute trauma to the ankle with positive OAR when excl usionary criteria \ndo not apply.  \nMRI Ankle  \nAlthough MRI may be used for occult injuries or suspicion for ligamentous tears in inversion injuries  [29], it is not \nthe first imagin g study  for the evaluation of acute trauma to the ankle with positive OAR . \nRadiography Ankle  \nRadiographs are indicated in patients who meet OAR criteria as the initial imaging study. Studies demonstrate \nbetween 92% and 99% sensitivity for detecting ankle fracture using these guidelines,  with <2% of those who are \nnegative for fracture using the OAR actually having a fracture [13-15,30] . The OAR are validated in children >5 \nyears of age and should not be used in pati ents meeting  the exclusionary criteria listed above [8]. Typical \nradiographic protocol s should include 3 standard views : anteroposterior,  lateral , and mortise views to include the \nbase of the fifth metatarsal bone distal to the tuberosity  [31]. Althou gh foot and ankle radiographs have been \nperformed together in clinical settings in the past, in a retrospective study of 243 patients with both radiographs \nperformed, no foot fractures other than the base of the fifth  metatarsal were noted. In the presence  of inversion \ninjury or fracture of the ankle, foot or knee radiographs should not be performed owing to low yield [32,33] . \nWeight -bearing radiographs, if possible, provide important information, particularly with fractures of uncertain \nstability, because the most important criterion in treatment of malleolar fractures is stability. A medial clear space \nof <4 mm should confirm stability. Increased incidence of fracture and instabilit y is noted with medial tenderness, \nbruising or swelling, fibular fracture above the syndesmosis, bi - or trimalleolar fractures, open fracture,  or high-\nenergy fracture injury  [34].

Kransdo rf, MD.q \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nAnkle pain is considered chronic when symptoms persist > 6 weeks. Chronic ankle  pain can be caused by a variety \nof osseous or soft -tissue abnormalities, either alone or in combination. For assessing chronic ankle pain, there are \nmultiple imaging options, including radiography, stress radiography,  computed tomography (CT)  radionuclide \nbone scanning, ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and various injection procedures. Injection \nproce dures include arthrography, CT arthrography, MR arthrography, and diagnostic injection with anesthetic \nagents. Although there are numerous causes for chronic ankle pain, common etiologies include osteoarthritis, \nosteochondral injury, tendon abnormalities, ligament abnormalities and instability, and impingement.  \nOverview of Imaging Modalities  \nRadiography Radiographs can provide information about the osseous and soft -tissue structures about the ankle. Routine \nradiographs of the ankle typically include anteroposterior, lateral, and mortise views, the latter obtained by internally rotating the foot 15 to 20 degrees.  Stress radiographs can be used to assess ankle instability  [1,2]; \nhowever , some have questioned their accuracy [3 ,4]. \nCT \nCT is not routinely used as a first -line imaging tool in chronic ankle pain, but it is more sensitive than \nradiographs, particularly for osseous abnormalities  [5]. CT arthrography may be more accurate than MR \narthrography for the identification of osteochondral abnormalities  [6]. \nBone Scan  \nConventional planar bone scintigraphy can assess osseous pathology.  More recently, single -photon emission \ncomputed tomogr aphy (SPECT)  combined with CT has been shown to provide additional information compared \nwith clinical diagnosis and conventional bone scintigraphy for the evaluation of impingement syndromes and soft -\ntissue pathology [7]. In addition, SPECT/CT abnormalities have been shown to significantly correlate with pain  in \nosteochondral lesions  [8]. \nUS \nUS can be used to evaluate for soft -tissue abnormalities, including tendon and ligament tears. In inflammatory \narthritis, it can help in the assessment of disease activity and severity as well as detect subclinical pathology in \nearly disease or after treatment [9 ]. US is ideal for dynamic assessment of peroneal tendon instability [10] and can \nbe used to guide interventions  [11]. Compared with some other modalities, US is less prone to artifacts, such as \nsusceptibility, motion, magic angle , and streak artifact, but dynamic assessment may be limited in cases of pain.  \nMRI  \nMRI is the imaging test that globally evaluates all anatomic structures, including ligaments, tendons, cartilage, \nand bone  [12,13]. Most studies have shown that MRI is highly accurate for evaluation of ligament, tendon,  and \n \naPrincipal Author and Panel Chair,  VA San Diego Healthcare System, San Diego, California . bResearch Author, University of California San Diego Medical \nCenter, San Diego, California.  cUniversity of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.  dRush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois; \nAmerican College of Physicians.  ePenn State Milton S.

Additionally, MRI identified the exact location of the injury in 93% of \nthe cases [15].  Comparing MRI with arthroscopy, studies have shown a range of accuracies of chronic lateral \nligament tearing (either partial or complete), ranging from 77 % to 92% for the anterior talofibular ligament and \n88% to 92% for the calcaneofibular ligament [14, 52]. For the evaluation of deep deltoid ligament tears, MRI is \nboth sensitive and specific compared with arthroscopy, with reported values of 96% and 98%, respectively [53].  \nWith regard to tears of the tibiofibular ligaments of the tibiofibular syndesmosis, MRI has a reported accuracy of 100% [54]. Additionally, MRI can also demonstrate interosseous membrane tears [55]. MRI offers the advantage \nof evaluating for injuries associated with or mimicking lateral instability that may not be diagnosed on stress radiography such as tenosynovitis, tendon injury, and osteochondral lesions [56]. MRI may also be used to evaluate the ankle after lateral ligament reconstruction [57].  \nMR Arthrography  \nMR arthrography can be helpful for the assessment of chronic ankle instability due to lateral collateral ligament injuries [12].  \nUS \nOne study evaluating anterior talofibular ligamen t injury demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy of 91% for US when \ncompared to arthroscopic findings. Additionally, US identified the exact location of the injury in 63% of cases \n[15]. Another study comparing US and CT arthrography for the diagnos is of anterior talofibular ligament injury \nshowed an accuracy of 61%  using US and 71% for CT arthrography [58].

Ankle radiographs normal or nonspecific, suspected ankle impingement \nsyndrome. Next study . \nImaging can also be used to diagnose ankle impingement syndromes, which can occur in the anterolateral, \nanterior, anteromedial, posteromedial, and posterior aspects of the ankle joint [62 -71].  \nMR Arthrography  \nMR arthrography has been found to be an accurate method for assessing both anterolateral and anteromedial \nimpingement with the advantage of joint capsule distention by intra -articular contrast injection [68, 69]. \nUS \nOne study involving anterolateral ankle impingement compared US to arthroscopic findings. The study found US had a sensitivity and specificity of 77% and 57%, respectively [ 70]. US also showed abnormal soft tissues in \nanterolateral impingement, with a reported accuracy of 100% in one study [72]. \nMRI  \nStudies on the accuracy of MRI in diagno sing anterolateral impingement syndrome have drawn varying \nconclusions, which may be related to varying MRI magnet strengths and inconsistent protocols [73]. Comparing MRI wi th surgical findings, studies have shown sensitivities between 75 % to 83% and specificity between 75 % to \n100% for the diagnosis of anterolateral impingement [73, 74]. \nOne study found that , when compared with arthroscopy,  fat-suppressed, IV contrast -enhanced, 3 -D gradient -\nrecalled echo imaging was sensitive for the evaluation of synovitis of the ankle associated wit h trauma (92%), \nwhereas it was specific for soft -tissue impingement evaluation (97%) when the ankle was divided into four \ncompartments: the anterolateral gutter, anteromedial gutter, anterior recess, and posterior recess [75].  \nMRI is useful in confirming the diagnosis, evaluating patients with an uncertain clinical diagnosis, and planning \nsurgery. Additionally, it can help exclude other pathologic entities that may mimic or coexist with impinge ment \nsyndromes. However, MRI features supportive of impingement may be present in asymptomatic individuals, and \nan accurate diagnosis requires careful correlation of imaging features findings with clinical findings [76]. There \nare only limited reports on the use of MRI for the other forms of ankle impingement syndrome, so its accuracy in \nthese conditions is not well established [62, 64,67,68]. \nCT Arthrography  \nOne study involving anterolateral ankle impingement compared CT arthrography to arthroscopic findings. The \nstudy found that CT arthrography had a sensitivity and specificity of 97% and 71%, respectively [77].  \nImage-guided Anesthetic Injection  \nFluoroscopic  or US-guided injection s have been shown as an effective treatment for some  ankle impingement \nsyndromes [78,79]. \nBone Scan with SPECT or SPECT/CT  \nRecently, SPECT combined with CT has been shown to provide additional information compared with clinical diagnosis and conventional bone scintigraphy for the evaluation of impingement syndromes and soft -tissue \npathology [7]. One study found that SPECT/CT provided information not sus pected on clinical diagnosis in 56% \nof cases with impingement syndromes or soft -tissue pathology [7 ]. \nCT \nCT may be useful for depiction of osseous causes of imp ingement, such as chronic abnormalities between the \ntalus and an os trigonum or fractures of the lateral tubercle of the talus or os trigonum [62].  \nArthrography  \nArthrography is not routinely used for the evaluation of ankle impingement syndromes.  \nRadiography Stress views are not routinely used for the evaluation of ankle impingement syndromes.  \nVariant 7: Chronic ankle pain.

Grossterlinden et al  [52] compared MRI and \nradiography and showed that 15% of ligamentous injuries (including sprains, partial tears, and complete tears) at \nthe syndesmosis in acute ankle injuries on M RI demonstra ted no fracture on radiography.  \nRare pantalar dislocations without associated talar or other fracture can be assessed on CT or MRI and have high \nrates of osteonecrosis, osteoarthritis, and infection  [71]. \nRadiography Ankle Stress Views  \nStress radiograph s may be useful in assessing syndesmotic instability, particularly in supination external rotation \nankle injuries according to the Lauge -Hansen classification. Lee et al [72]  noted that tibiotalar tilt angle and anterior \ntibiofibular space measurements were affected when the anterior tibiofibular and posterior talofibular ligaments \nwere injured (confirmed on MRI) in 299 patients . Lateral stress testing with widening of the tibiofibular clear space \nhas been shown to be  an indicator of syndesmotic injury , with the traditional external rotation stress test shown to \nbe a poor indicator when t he deltoid ligament is injured [73] . \nRadiography Leg \nMaisonneuve fracture (syndesmotic injury of the ankle in combination with a proximal fibular fracture) may be \noverlooked as a result of  lack of pain at the fibula. Careful palpation of the proximal fibula should be performed \nwith radiographic evaluation of the entire tibia and fibular if focal tenderness is present [74] . \nUS Ankle  \nUS is not typically the next line of evaluation  of syndesmotic injuries. Although some studies have suggested \nfocused US could be beneficial for ligamentous evaluation, others have shown limited utility in lateral ankle \nligament spr ains [75]. \nSummary of Recommendations  \nVariant 1: Ankle radiographs are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of patients 5 years of age or older with \nacute trauma to the ankle or acute trauma to the ankle with persistent pain for more than 1 week but less than 3 \nweeks with no exclusionar y criteria present and the OAR  are positive : 1. Inability to bear weight immediately after \nthe injury, OR  2. Point tenderness over the medial malleolus, the posterior edge or inferior tip of the lateral \nmalleolus, talus, or calcaneus, OR  3. Inability to ambulate for 4 steps in the emergency department.  \nVariant 2: Imaging is usually not appropriate for patients 5 years of age or older with a cute trauma to the ankle \nwhen the patient is able  to walk  and there are no exclusionary criteria present (eg, neurologically intact (includ ing \nno peripheral neuropathy )) and  the OAR  are negative: No point tenderness over the malleoli, talus, or calcaneus on \nphysical examination.  \nVariant 3: Ankle radiographs are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of patients 5 ye ars of age or older  with \nacute trauma to the ankle when exclusionary criteria are present (eg, neurologic disorder, neuropathy, or other) and \nthe patient does not meet requirements for evaluation by the OAR . \nVariant 4: MRI ankle without IV contrast or CT a nkle without IV contrast  are usually appropriate  for patients 5 \nyears of age or older with acute trauma to the ankle with persistent pain for more than 1 week but less than 3 weeks \nthat had negative initial radiographs and no exclusionary criteria are present.", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 9 Acute Trauma to the Ankle  fracture talus, also known as the  LIFT lesion) can occur after twisting injury to the ankle.  Initial radiographs should \nbe followed by CT  and MR I [60,61] . These lesions are treated successfully with combined open approach and \narthroscop y. \nFractures  \nCT is the first -line imaging  study  after radiographs to determine extent, displacement , comminution, intra -articular \nextension , associated injuries,  and potential classification of fractures [48] . This is particularly important in subtalar, \ncalcaneal,  and talar fractures because of  the complex anatomy and in high -impact polytrauma or complex \ncomminuted injuries in which multiplanar CT imaging is recommended to help direct the preoperative planning \nevaluation process [62]. \nMRI Ankle  \nOsteochondral lesions  \nMRI without  IV contrast is co nsidered the study of choice for assessment of cartilage abnormalities and bone \ncontusions related to acquired  osteochondral lesion,  particularly in patients with symptoms of persistent pain, \nstiffness, locking, clicking , and ankle swelling  [22,55-57,63] . Although radiographs and CT depict ossific fragments \nand fracture lines, cartilage abnormalities and bone contusions related to osteochondral lesion are best seen on MRI. \nSeventy percent  of ankle fractures and 50% of ankle sprains have been shown to result in some variation of cartilage \ninjury [57,58,61,64] . \nFractures  \nAlthough CT is more commonly used as the next step in fracture assessment in  known fractures, MRI can be useful \nas a follow-up imaging modality for assessment of associated bone marrow contusions, stress injuries,  or fractures \n[65]. MRI is especially important in fracture sites such as the talus,  which are at higher risk for osteonecrosis. MR I \nis highly accurate for associated soft -tissue abnormalities including tendon entrapment/dislocation and for \nligamentous inju ries [66]. \nRadiography Ankle Broden\u2019s View  \nThe Broden view is a supine  flexed knee view with 30 \u00b0 to 45\u00b0 internal rotation that  can be used  for specific improved \nevaluation of the lateral process fracture of the talus (commonly known as snowboarder\u2019s fracture). It may be of \nuse when further evaluation of the talar fracture is needed.  \nUS Ankle  \nOsteochondra l lesion  \nUS is not the next step in this clinical scenario.  \nFractures  \nUS has been shown to be useful for identification of lateral malleolar, medial malleolar , and fifth metatarsal \nfractures [41] but is not conside red a first -line assessment tool  or next imaging study  in this clinical scenario.  \nVariant 6 : Adult or child 5 years of age or older. Acute trauma to the ankle. Radiographs negative for osseous \ninjury and physical examination or radiographs demonstrate alignment abnormality  suggesting \nsyndesmotic/ligamentous injury or dislocation. Next study. \nLateral sprain is more common than medial strain , with the anterior talofibular ligament most commonly tor n. High \nsprain and fractures are more common in high -collision sport injuries [60], with higher incidence of ankle injuries \nduring winter months [67] and increased incidence in military recruits [68]. Inversion injuries of the ankle account \nfor 25% of musculoskeletal system injuries and 50% of all sports -related injuries [1].  \nBone Scan Ankle  \nBone scan is not routinely the next line of imaging in this clinical scenario.  \nCT Ankle  \nCT is useful for evaluation of dislocation and can be used to detect  syndesmotic injuries, although MRI is better for \nsoft-tissue evaluation. Nault et al [69]  validated CT scan measurement s that  can identify syndesmotic injuries seen \non MRI (retrosp ective study of MRI and CT) as a result of  modification of distal tibiofibular relationship after a \nmild syndesmotic injury.", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 8 Acute Trauma to the Ankle  dislocation, with fractures involving the posterior facet, with associated massive swelling, or with  failure to regain \nsubtalar motion after a period of immobilizat ion [49]. \nCT with IV contrast is not ind icated in this scenario because soft-tissue abnormalities and fluid collections can be \nidentified on noncontr ast high -resolution CT studies. \nMRI Ankle  \nMRI of the ankle without IV contrast is most sensitive for evaluation of occult fractures with associated bone \nmarrow edema patterns, particularly in inversion injuries and persistent lateral ankle pain, as well  as presence and \nextent of soft -tissue injuries  [29]. Stress injuries of bone , including those of the weekend warrior , are best depicted \nby MRI  [50]. \nMRI is the reference standard for ligamentous injury and assessment of stability , which is particularly important in \nathletes, in whom determination of grade ( 1, 2, or 3) of syndesmotic ligament, anterior tibiofibular ligament , and \ndeltoid injuries is critical for treatment planning and return to sport assessment [51]. High -resolution evaluation of \nthe tendons and ligaments allows distinction between tendinopathy, sprain, and partial or complete tears.  \nLigament and tendon  injuries can occur without fracture on radiography . Gross terlinden et al [52] compared MR I \nand radiography and showed that 15% of ligamentous injuries ( including sprains , partial tears, and complete tears) \nat the syndesmosis in acute ankle injuries on MRI demonstrated no fracture on radiography. Presence o f bone bruise \nand adjacent soft -tissue edema have shown a higher association with acute ligamentous injuries ( anterior talofibular \nligament most common) and tendon abnormalities [53,54]  in patients with negative radiographs.  MRI can also help \nexclude Salter 1 fractures in the pediatric population [55]. \nRadiography Ankle  \nRepeat radiograph s are not typically the next study but may be of use to identify early callous formation at an occult \nfracture line or possible mineralization at a site of intramuscular hematoma if contusion occurred during trauma. \nRadiographs with better technique may assist in diagnosis of subtle injuries such as the lateral talar process avulsion , \nwhich  may erroneously be diagnosed as  a lateral ankle sprain  [37]. \nRadiography Ankle Stress Views  \nAlthough ankle stress views are not the typical next best study for this patient group, if  there is clinical evidence of \ninstability on physician maneuvers, ankle stress views may be of benefit for identification of occult avulsion injury \nat ligamentous attachments that may contribute t o widening of the joint spac e on radiographic stress views.  \nUS Ankle  \nUS is not typically  the next imaging study . US may be useful as a secondary evaluation modality for focuse d \nevaluation of underlying soft -tissue injuries  and ligaments, with the added benefit of dynamic imaging. This \nincludes f ocused high-resolution US of the peroneal tendons and th e superior peroneal retinaculum  [56], stress US \n(during anterior drawer) to assess joint laxity or chondral avulsion fra ctures associated with lateral ligament injury \nin children with negative radiographs [57,58] , and potential detection of superficial occult fractures at the base of \nthe fifth metatarsal, lateral malleolus,  and malleolus [41] . \nVariant  5: Adult or child 5 years of age or older. Acute trauma to the ankle. No exclusionary criteria present. \nRadiographs demonstrate fracture or potential osteochondral injury.

Bone scan may be used in rare setting in polytrauma \ncases for evaluation of multiple fractures.  \nCT Ankle  \nOsteoch ondral lesions  \nAlthough MRI is the reference standard, CT is also of utility to identify, locate, and quantify cortical and subcortical \ninvolvement or loss  as well as presence of intra -articular ossific bodies or associated fractures.", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 6 Acute Trauma to the Ankle  \u2022 Axial Harris- Beath  view: The axial Harris-Beath view is used for suspected calcaneal fractures and to determine \nintra-articular extent.  \n\u2022 Broden view: The Broden view is a supine flexed knee view with 30 \u00b0 to 45\u00b0  internal rotation that can be used \nfor specific improved evaluation of the lateral process fracture of the talus (commonly known as snowboarder\u2019s \nfracture). It may be of use when further evaluation of the fracture is needed.  \n\u2022 Bicycle spoke injuries in children : These injuries are unusual but can occur with entrapment of the leg in the \nspokes of the bicycle wheel. In a study by Slaar et al [35], if no fracture is noted on ankle radiographs , then  no \nfurther imaging is warranted . However, if an ankle fracture is present, lower leg imaging may be important to \nassess the distal tibia and fibula but not the foot.  \n\u2022 Snowboarder\u2019s fracture (lateral talar process or V sign on radiographs) : These fractures may be overlooked \non routine radiographs between 40% and 50% of the time [36].  Special attention to this area is recommended \nin patients with swelling inferior to the lateral malleolus in t he appropriate clinical setting  to exclude an \nerroneous diagnosis of a lateral ankle sprain  [37]. Lateral inversion stress radiograph s may be useful for full \nevaluation  [38].  \n\u2022 Anterior talofibular ligament view radiograph: This view may be useful for diagnosis of distal fibular avul sion \nfractures in children with lateral ankle sprain if not seen on traditional 3 -view radiographs . Identification of an \noccult fibular fracture is noted using this view  in 26% of lateral ankle sprain patients [39] . \n\u2022 The gravity stress view : This view is more rel iable and easier to perform than  a manual stress view in supination -\nexternal rotation injuries of the ankle with higher suspected incidence of deltoid ligament disruption [40] . \nUS Ankle  \nUltrasound (US)  may be useful but is not typically considered the first  line of imaging for the evaluation of acute \ntrauma to the ankle with positive OAR [41]. \nVariant 2: Adult or child 5 years of age or older.

Acute trauma to the ankle or acute trauma to the ankle \nwith persistent pain for more than 1 week but less than 3 weeks. No exclusionary criteria present. Initial \nimaging. Patient meets the requirements for evaluation by the Ottawa Ankle Rules which are positive:  \n1. Inability to bear weight immediately after the injury, OR  \n2. Point tenderness over the medial mall eolus, the posterior edge or inferior tip of the lateral malleolus, \ntalus, or calcaneus, OR  \n3. Inability to ambulate for 4 steps in the emergency department.  \nBone Scan Ankle  \nBone scan is not routinely used as the first imaging study for the evaluation of acute trauma to the ankle with \npositive OAR.  \nCT Ankle   \nAlthough CT may be used in polytrauma patients to determine the extent of injury in complex fractures, CT is not \nroutinely used as the first imaging study of acute trauma to the ankle with positive OAR when excl usionary criteria \ndo not apply.  \nMRI Ankle  \nAlthough MRI may be used for occult injuries or suspicion for ligamentous tears in inversion injuries  [29], it is not \nthe first imagin g study  for the evaluation of acute trauma to the ankle with positive OAR . \nRadiography Ankle  \nRadiographs are indicated in patients who meet OAR criteria as the initial imaging study. Studies demonstrate \nbetween 92% and 99% sensitivity for detecting ankle fracture using these guidelines,  with <2% of those who are \nnegative for fracture using the OAR actually having a fracture [13-15,30] . The OAR are validated in children >5 \nyears of age and should not be used in pati ents meeting  the exclusionary criteria listed above [8]. Typical \nradiographic protocol s should include 3 standard views : anteroposterior,  lateral , and mortise views to include the \nbase of the fifth metatarsal bone distal to the tuberosity  [31]. Althou gh foot and ankle radiographs have been \nperformed together in clinical settings in the past, in a retrospective study of 243 patients with both radiographs \nperformed, no foot fractures other than the base of the fifth  metatarsal were noted. In the presence  of inversion \ninjury or fracture of the ankle, foot or knee radiographs should not be performed owing to low yield [32,33] . \nWeight -bearing radiographs, if possible, provide important information, particularly with fractures of uncertain \nstability, because the most important criterion in treatment of malleolar fractures is stability. A medial clear space \nof <4 mm should confirm stability. Increased incidence of fracture and instabilit y is noted with medial tenderness, \nbruising or swelling, fibular fracture above the syndesmosis, bi - or trimalleolar fractures, open fracture,  or high-\nenergy fracture injury  [34]. Special scenarios that warrant special mention and additional views include:", "These procedures are equivalent \nalternatives (ie, only one procedure will be ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage the \npatient\u2019s care).  \nVariant 5: CT ankle without IV contrast or MRI ankle without IV contrast are usuall y appropriate for patients 5 \nyears of age or older with acute trauma to the ankle that had radiographs demonstrating fracture or potential \nosteochondral injury and have no exclusionary criteria present.  These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, \nonly one procedure will be ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage the patient\u2019s care).  CT"], ["ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 7 Acute Trauma to the Foot  injuries  in midtarsal  (Chopart) sprains,  which  frequently  accompany  acute ankle  injuries  [52,53] . If radiographs  \nare negative,  MRI can be obtained in select  patients  with forefoot  pain because of its increased  sensitivity  for the \nearly  detection  of metatarsal  head  subchondral  fracture  [54]. \nLisfranc  Injury  \nMRI has been  advocated  as a sensitive diagnostic  test in evaluation  of Lisfranc ligamentous  complex  (especially  \nif the patient  is not able to bear weight),  and 3-D volumetric  acquisitions  have  proven superiority  over orthogonal  \nproton  density  fat-suppressed  imaging [33,38,41- 45]. There is a high correlation  between  MRI and intraoperative  \nfindings  for an unstable  Lisfranc injury  [44]. In the patient  with a suspected  Lisfranc injury  and normal  \nradiographs,  the literature  supports  further advanced  imaging  by MRI  and CT [21,33,43,46] . \nTurf Toe and Plantar  Plate Injuries \nMRI is the preferred  imaging method for evaluating  suspected  \u201cturf  toe\u201d and lesser  metatarsal  plantar  plate  injury  \nby directly  evaluating  the soft-tissue structures of the capsuloligamentous  complex  as well as assessing  chondral  \nand osteochondral  lesions [29,55,56] . \nAcute  Tendinous  Rupture  \nMRI tends  to be used as a screening  tool when  one is not certain  of the specific tendon injury  or if concomitant  \nosseous injury  is suspected.  Both  MRI and US have  been  shown  to be sensitive  for the diagnosis  of acute tendon  \nrupture  or dislocation  in the foot [39]. In a surgically  confirmed  study,  MRI was shown  to have  83% sensitivity  \nfor diagnosing tendon and ligament  traumatic  injuries  about  the foot and ankle  [37]. \nUS Foot  \nThe importance  of focused  US examinations  is emphasized  in the literature  [57,58] . Protocol -based  US evaluation  \nidentified  97.4%  of symptomatic abnormalities  in the distal  extremities  (including the foot),  with additional  \naccuracy  obtained  with focused  examination  [57]. \nLisfranc  Injury  \nAlthough  the literature  evidence is limited, US may hold promise  as an alternative method to accurately  evaluate \nfor a significant  Lisfranc injury  providing direct  and indirect  assessment  of the Lisfranc ligamentous  complex  as \nwell as dynamic  evaluation  with weightbearing  as demonstrated  in a series of 10 patients  [59].  Dorsal  component  \nof Lisfranc ligament  is amenable to direct  US evaluation  [59,60] , although this structure may not be critical  for \nstability  for the Lisfranc joint [20,32] . The physiologic  deformation of the dorsal  Lisfranc ligament  resulting  from  \nfunctional  loading emphasized  the need  for normative  US data as well as proper  positioning  when  bilateral  \nevaluation  is performed  [61,62] . \nTurf Toe and Plantar  Plate Injuries \nUS in the sagittal  plane  best visualizes  the plantar  plate  between  the flexor  tendon and hyaline  cartilage of the \nmetatarsal  head  [63]. US has shown  a 96% sensitivity  compared  with 87% sensitivity  for MRI  for the detection  of \nlesser  toe plantar  plate  tears;  however , both modalities  have  poor specificity  [64].  \nAcute  Tendinous  Rupture  \nBoth  MRI and US have  been  shown  to be sensitive for the diagnosis  of acute tendon  rupture  or dislocation  in the \nfoot [39]. US has also been  reported  to have  a high sensitivity  for peroneal  tendon  tears [65].", "ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 6 Acute Trauma to the Foot  Radiograph y Foot  \nMetatarsal -Phalangeal  Joint Injury  \nThe best initial imaging study  for evaluating  hallux  plantar  plate  disruption  after metatarsal -phalangeal  (MTP)  \njoint injury  is weightbearing  AP, lateral,  and sesamoid  axial  views,  with addition  of comparison  radiographs  of \nthe contralateral  foot [29].  Radiographs  may also indirectly  evaluate lesser  metatarsophalangeal  plantar  plate  \ninjury  [30]. The combination  of a positive  drawer  test coupled with transverse deviation  of the third  MTP  joint on \nradiographs  can be used to diagnose  high-grade  plantar  plate  tear of the second  MTP joint [31]. \nA forced  dorsiflexion lateral  view of the hallux  MTP  joint is recommended  if there is clinical  suspicion  of plantar  \nplate  injury  of the first MTP joint [29]. \nRadiography Foot  with  Weightbearing  \nThe best initial imaging study  for evaluating  hallux  plantar  plate  disruption after MTP joint injury  is \nweightbearing  AP, lateral,  and sesamoid  axial  views  with addition  of comparison radiographs  of the contralateral  \nfoot [29,32] . \nCT Foot  \nStudies  report  moderate to poor sensitivity  (25%\u201333%)  of radiographs  in detection  of midfoot  fractures [21] in \nLevel  1 trauma  patients.  A study of 49 patients  with acute hyperflexion injuries  to the foot concluded that \nconventional  radiographs  including  weightbearing  images are not sufficient  for routine  diagnostic  workup and CT \nshould serve as the primary  imaging  technique  for such patients  [33]. \nMRI Foot  \nMRI is the most  sensitive modality  for the detection  of occult  fracture  and acute bone  stress changes [34,35] . MRI  \nis not routinely  used as the first imaging study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the foot in setting  of suspected  \nMTP joint injury  or occult  fracture.  Both  MRI and US are used in evaluating  soft-tissue injuries  of the foot in the \nsetting  of acute trauma,  especially  when  radiographs  are noncontributory.  Both  modalities  have  a similar  \nsensitivity  for acute soft-tissue  trauma  about  the ankle  and foot such as ligamentous  and tendinous  disruption [36-\n38]. \nUS Foot  \nUS is not routinely  used as the first imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the foot in the setting  of \nsuspected  MTP joint injury  or occult  fracture.  US has been  shown  to be sensitive for the diagnosis  of acute tendon  \nrupture  or tendon dislocation  in the foot [36,39,40] . \nFluoroscopy  Foot  \nIn addition  to routine  radiographs , fluoroscopy  has been  suggested  in assessment  of a hallux  MTP joint injury  \nwith direct  fluoroscopic  evaluation  of sesamoid  tracking  distally  with great  toe extension  at the MTP joint on \nforced  dorsiflexion lateral  view or fluoroscopy  [29]. \nVariant  5: Adult  or child older  than  5 years of age. Acute trauma  to the foot.  Suspect  Lisfranc injury, \ntendon injury, or occult  fracture or dislocation. Radiographs  are normal  or equivocal. Next  imaging  study. \nCT Foot  \nLisfranc  Injury  \nCT has been  advocated  as the primary  imaging  technique  in acute hyperflexion  injury  and high-energy  \npolytrauma  (especially  if the patient is not able to bear weight)  [33,38,41- 45].", "Radiography Foot  with  Weightbearing  \nIf there are clinical  signs  of a Lisfranc  injury , obtaining  weight bearing  radiographs  is recommended  when  \npossible  because nonweightbearing  radiographs  are not reliable  for detection  of subtle  injuries.  Weightbearing  \nviews have  been  shown  to increase the abnormal  alignment  at the Lisfranc joint, thus making it easier  to identify  a \nLisfranc injury  [16,19] . The inclusion  of both feet on AP radiographs  can help in the detection  of subtle  \nmalalignment  when  compared  with the uninjured side [20]. \nCT Foot  \nCT is commonly used in evaluating  the true extent  of osseous injury  in complex fractures and at times  is used as \nthe initial imaging  study  in polytrauma  patients  and in complex  regions  such as the midfoot  [21,22] . CT is not \nroutinely  used as the first imaging study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the foot with positive  Ottawa rules  \nwhen  exclusionary  criteria  do not apply.  \nMRI Foot \nMRI is not routinely used as the first imaging study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the foot with positive  \nOttawa rules .", "CT is useful  in demonstrating the \nmultiple  metatarsal  and cuneiform  fractures that can be associated  with a ligamentous  Lisfranc  injury  [21,22,33] . \nCT is typically  used for preoperative  planning  for fracture  treatment  and evaluation.  In the patient  with a \nsuspected  Lisfranc  injury  and normal  radiographs,  the literature  supports  further  advanced  imaging  by MRI  and \nCT [21,33,43,46] . \nAcute  Tendinous  Injury  \nCT imaging has been  shown  to be an effective way of documenting various  tendon entrapment  and dislocations,  \nin particularly  peroneal  dislocations  and peroneal  retinacular  injuries , which  are associated  with comminuted  \ncalcaneal  fractures  [47-50]. \nMRI Foot  \nMRI can show  osseous injuries  that are not visible  radiographically including  fractures and high-grade  contusions  \nassociated  with prolonged recovery  times  in elite athletes [51].

Acute trauma  to the foot.  Ottawa  rules cannot  be \nevaluated  due to exclusionary  criteria.  Initial imaging.  \nMultiple  conditions  or scenarios preclude  the use of the Ottawa rules for determining  if imaging  is necessary  \n[5,6] . It has been  reported  that the Ottawa rules  for the foot should not be used or should be used with great  \ncaution  in the following  clinical  situations:  penetrating  trauma,  pregnancy,  any skin wound,  transferred  with \nradiographs  already  taken,  >10 days after trauma,  a return  visit for continued  traumatic  foot pain,  in the setting  of \npolytrauma,  altered  sensorium,  neurologic  abnormality  affecting  the foot, or underlying  bone  disease [7]. \nRadiograph y Foot  \nIf a foot fracture is suspected  in a neurologically  compromised  patient, including patients  with diabetic  \nneuropathy , the foot should  be radiographed.  The Ottawa rules  should  not be applied  in this clinical  setting  \nbecause pain perception  may be diminished,  no point  tenderness will be elicited  with palpation,  and the patient  \nmay be able to ambulate  even  if a fracture is present  [5]. Polytrauma  and penetrating  trauma  also constitute  \nexceptions  to the implementations  of the Ottawa rules . \nBoth  radiographs  and US are useful  imaging tools  to exclude  a foreign  body in the setting  of penetrating  trauma  to \nthe foot [24]. The best initial imaging study  for a foreign  body in the foot depends  on whether  or not the suspected  \nforeign  body is radiopaque  (eg, gravel,  both leaded  and nonleaded  glass,  or metal).  Radiographic  evaluation  for a \nradiopaque  foreign body has approximately  98% sensitivity  [25]. If an unembedded fragment  of the foreign  body \nis available,  then imaging  it alongside  the foot might  provide  more  information  as to the morphology and density  \nof the foreign  body.  \nCT Foot  \nCT is commonly used in evaluating  the true extent  of osseous injury  in complex fractures and at times  is used as \nthe initial imaging  study  in polytrauma  patients  and in complex  regions  such as the midfoot  [21,22] . In the \npolytrauma  patient, approximately  25% of midfoot  fractures identified  on CT are overlooked on radiographs  [21].  \nTherefore,  CT is essential  for appropriate  treatment  planning and determining  the true extent  of osseous injuries  in \nthe polytrauma  patient  and can be used as primary  imaging  technique  in high-energy  polytrauma  patients.  \nInitial clinical  experience suggests that cone -beam  CT of the foot or ankle  of pediatric  patients  is a viable  lower -\ndose alternative  to multidetector  CT [26]. \nMRI Foot  \nMRI is not routinely  used as the first imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the foot in the setting  of \nperipheral  neuropathy,  penetrating  trauma , or polytrauma .", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 9 Acute Trauma to the Ankle  fracture talus, also known as the  LIFT lesion) can occur after twisting injury to the ankle.  Initial radiographs should \nbe followed by CT  and MR I [60,61] . These lesions are treated successfully with combined open approach and \narthroscop y. \nFractures  \nCT is the first -line imaging  study  after radiographs to determine extent, displacement , comminution, intra -articular \nextension , associated injuries,  and potential classification of fractures [48] . This is particularly important in subtalar, \ncalcaneal,  and talar fractures because of  the complex anatomy and in high -impact polytrauma or complex \ncomminuted injuries in which multiplanar CT imaging is recommended to help direct the preoperative planning \nevaluation process [62]. \nMRI Ankle  \nOsteochondral lesions  \nMRI without  IV contrast is co nsidered the study of choice for assessment of cartilage abnormalities and bone \ncontusions related to acquired  osteochondral lesion,  particularly in patients with symptoms of persistent pain, \nstiffness, locking, clicking , and ankle swelling  [22,55-57,63] . Although radiographs and CT depict ossific fragments \nand fracture lines, cartilage abnormalities and bone contusions related to osteochondral lesion are best seen on MRI. \nSeventy percent  of ankle fractures and 50% of ankle sprains have been shown to result in some variation of cartilage \ninjury [57,58,61,64] . \nFractures  \nAlthough CT is more commonly used as the next step in fracture assessment in  known fractures, MRI can be useful \nas a follow-up imaging modality for assessment of associated bone marrow contusions, stress injuries,  or fractures \n[65]. MRI is especially important in fracture sites such as the talus,  which are at higher risk for osteonecrosis. MR I \nis highly accurate for associated soft -tissue abnormalities including tendon entrapment/dislocation and for \nligamentous inju ries [66]. \nRadiography Ankle Broden\u2019s View  \nThe Broden view is a supine  flexed knee view with 30 \u00b0 to 45\u00b0 internal rotation that  can be used  for specific improved \nevaluation of the lateral process fracture of the talus (commonly known as snowboarder\u2019s fracture). It may be of \nuse when further evaluation of the talar fracture is needed.  \nUS Ankle  \nOsteochondra l lesion  \nUS is not the next step in this clinical scenario.  \nFractures  \nUS has been shown to be useful for identification of lateral malleolar, medial malleolar , and fifth metatarsal \nfractures [41] but is not conside red a first -line assessment tool  or next imaging study  in this clinical scenario.  \nVariant 6 : Adult or child 5 years of age or older. Acute trauma to the ankle. Radiographs negative for osseous \ninjury and physical examination or radiographs demonstrate alignment abnormality  suggesting \nsyndesmotic/ligamentous injury or dislocation. Next study. \nLateral sprain is more common than medial strain , with the anterior talofibular ligament most commonly tor n. High \nsprain and fractures are more common in high -collision sport injuries [60], with higher incidence of ankle injuries \nduring winter months [67] and increased incidence in military recruits [68]. Inversion injuries of the ankle account \nfor 25% of musculoskeletal system injuries and 50% of all sports -related injuries [1].  \nBone Scan Ankle  \nBone scan is not routinely the next line of imaging in this clinical scenario.  \nCT Ankle  \nCT is useful for evaluation of dislocation and can be used to detect  syndesmotic injuries, although MRI is better for \nsoft-tissue evaluation. Nault et al [69]  validated CT scan measurement s that  can identify syndesmotic injuries seen \non MRI (retrosp ective study of MRI and CT) as a result of  modification of distal tibiofibular relationship after a \nmild syndesmotic injury.", "US Foot  \nUS is not routinely  used as the first imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the foot in the setting  of \nperipheral  neuropathy or polytrauma.  Both  radiographs  and US are useful  imaging  tools  to exclude  a foreign  body  \nin the setting  of penetrating  trauma  to the foot [24]. US is the imaging  modality  of choice if the foreign  body is \nnot radiopaque  (eg, wood  or plastic) , with a reported  90% sensitivity  for visualizing  wooden  foreign  bodies  in \nsome  clinical  and experimental  studies [27,28] . US can identify  a foreign  body  and also help localize  it and \ndetermine if it involves  a tendon  or a muscle and to evaluate for an abscess.  \nVariant  4: Adult  or child older  than  5 years of age.

For example,  clinical scenarios of acute foot trauma  not directly  \naddressed  by the Ottawa rules include  trauma  to the metatarsal  heads  and toes and acute tendon injury."], ["ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 6 Chronic Knee Pain  of age having an asymptomatic meniscal tear , and the likelihood of a meniscal tear being present in either a \npainful or asymptomatic knee not significantly different in patients 45 to 55 years of age [20,21]. \nBone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the \nsubchondral bone.  New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or \npatients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee \npain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the \norigin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. \nSubchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed \nspontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to \nelderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs \noften initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, \nand progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is \nsuspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria\n\u00ae \ntopic on \u201c Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae \u201d [28]. \nSome patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using \nquantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs \nexhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ]. \nPatellofemoral car tilage loss is also associated with chronic knee pain , with active knee pain correlated with \nBMLs [30,31]. Similar to CT, MRI can calculate various anatomic measurements associated with patellofemoral \nsubluxation/dislocation and lateral patellofemoral friction syndrome [32-34]. Bone marrow edema in the classic \nlocation for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also \ndifferentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise \ntherapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. \nOther etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat \npad impingement syndromes, Hoffa\u2019s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome, adhesive \ncapsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes , \nand osteonecrosis [15, 19,36-45].  \nMRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a \njoint effusion. However, contrast -enhanced images ma y be more accurate in diagnosing other causes of chronic \nknee pain , such as Hoffa\u2019s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome, and adhesive \ncapsulitis [15].  In particular, enh ancing synovitis thicker than 2 mm in Hoffa\u2019s fat is correlated with peripatellar \npain [46]. Contrast -enhanced MRI is also useful in quantifying the degree of synovitis and in evaluating \nconditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis [ 17,42,47,48].  \nMR Arthrography  Knee  \nMR arthrography performed with an intra -articular injection of dilute gadolinium solution is typically not \nindicated as a second exam ination  but rather reserved for patients with known prior meniscal surgery, chondral \nand osteochondral lesions , and suspected loose bodies  [10].", "ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 12 Acute  Trauma  to the Knee  Variant  7: Adult  or child 5 years of age or older . Significant  trauma  to the knee  (eg, motor  vehicle  accident,  \nknee  dislocation). Initial imaging.  \nArteriography  Lower Extremity  \nVascular  injury  may be found in about  30% of patients  following  posterior  knee  dislocation  [56]. Injuries  of the \npopliteal artery  require  prompt  surgical  intervention to help limb preservation . Associated  peroneal  and tibial nerve  \ninjuries  may cause significant  morbidity and require  an understanding of their pathophysiologic  implications  to \nmaximize  limb functionality  [57]. Angiography  has been  the reference standard  in the evaluation  of vascular  injuries  \nassociated  with knee  dislocations  [58]. However,  this is an invasive  procedure  with associated  risk, and with the \nexcellent  performance of CTA and MRA, it is usually  performed  in selected  cases  [58]. \nCT Knee  \nCT is not routinely  used as the initial imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the knee.  CT is superior  \nto knee  radiographs  in detection  and classification  of fractures [12]; however,  without  IV contrast , CT cannot  detect  \nvascular  injuries. \nCTA Lower Extremity  \nWith  suspected  vascular  injuries  in the setting  of knee  dislocation, CTA  is frequently  used because it is less invasive  \nand has a similar ly high accuracy  as conventional  angiography [58-60]. \nMR Arthrography  Knee  \nIn patients  with significant  acute knee  trauma  with suspected  or possible  dislocation , MR arthrography  of the knee \nis not routinely used as the initial imaging  study.  \nMRA Knee  \nMRI is an accurate method used in the evaluation  of soft-tissue,  osseous,  and neural  injuries  after knee  dislocation  \n[61]. MRA  may be performed  simultaneously  with MRI  for evaluation  of internal  derangement  and vascular  injuries  \nwith less morbidity  compared  with conventional  angiography  [62]. Potter  et al [61] reported  their experience with \npopliteal fossa MRA  with encouraging  results and complete agreement  between  the MRA  and conventional  \nangiography in patients  who had both studies.  Similarly, in a study  by Tocci  et al [62], MRA  has been  shown  to be \nas accurate and useful  as conventional  angiography in the evaluation  of popliteal  artery  injuries  of patients  with \nknee  dislocations.  \nMRI Knee  \nWith  its superb  contrast  resolution  and multiplanar  imaging capability , MRI is proven to be a highly  accurate  \nimaging modality  in the evaluation  of bone  marrow  contusions  and occult  fractures [27-29] as well as meniscal  \n[21,26]  and ligamentous  injuries  [21,31,32] .

New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or \npatients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee \npain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the \norigin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. \nSubchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed \nspontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to \nelderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs \noften initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, \nand progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is \nsuspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria\n\u00ae \ntopic on \u201c Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae \u201d [28]. \nSome patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using \nquantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs \nexhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ]. \nPatellofemoral car tilage loss is also associated with chronic knee pain , with active knee pain correlated with \nBMLs [30,31]. Similar to CT, MRI can calculate various anatomic measurements associated with patellofemoral \nsubluxation/dislocation and lateral patellofemoral friction syndrome [32-34]. Bone marrow edema in the classic \nlocation for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also \ndifferentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise \ntherapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. \nOther etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat \npad impingement syndromes, Hoffa\u2019s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome, adhesive \ncapsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes , \nand osteonecrosis [15, 19,36-45].  \nMRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a \njoint effusion. However, contrast -enhanced images ma y be more accurate in diagnosing other causes of chronic \nknee pain , such as Hoffa\u2019s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome, and adhesive \ncapsulitis [15].  In particular, enh ancing synovitis thicker than 2 mm in Hoffa\u2019s fat is correlated with peripatellar \npain [46]. Contrast -enhanced MRI is also useful in quantifying the degree of synovitis and in evaluating \nconditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis [ 17,42,47,48].  \nMR Arthrography  Knee  \nMR arthrography performed with an intra -articular injection of dilute gadolinium solution is typically not \nindicated as a second exam ination  but rather reserved for patients with known prior meniscal surgery, chondral \nand osteochondral lesions , and suspected loose bodies  [10].", "Next \nimaging procedure . \nWhen associated with acute injury, recommendations are covered in the  ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae topic on \n\u201cAcute Trauma to the Knee\u201d  [4].", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 4 Chronic Knee Pain  CHRONIC  KNEE PAIN\nExpert Panel on Musculoskel etal Imaging: Michael G.

Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and \nit can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain \nwith the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. \nTypically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain \npersists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  \nimaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated \nthat approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the \nprior year) radiographs [2 ]. \nThis document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  \u22655 years of age.  The \nvariants discussed include: (1) initial exam ination ; (2) initial radiograph is normal or demonstrates a joint \neffusion; (3) initial radiogr aph demonstrates osteochondritis dissecans (OCD), loose bodies or history of cartilage,  \nor meniscal repair; (4) initial radiograph demonstrates osteoarthritis or chondrocalcinosis; and (5)  initial \nradiograph demonstrates signs of prior (chronic) knee injur y (ie, Segond fract ure, tibial spine avulsion, etc ).  \nTo evaluat e knee pain associated with other conditions, please refer to the following ACR Appropriateness \nCriteria\u00ae topic on:  \u201cOsteonecrosi s of the Hip \u201d [3] for osteonecrosis,  \u201cAcute Trauma to the Knee \u201d for acute knee \ninjuries  [4], \u201cImaging After Total Knee Arthroplasty \u201d for patients with total knee arthroplasty  [5], \u201cSoft-Tissue \nMasses \u201d for a patient with a suspected soft -tissue mass [6], \u201cPrimary Bone Tumors \u201d for a patient with a suspected \nor known bone tumor [ 7], and \u201c Chronic Extremity Joint Pain -Suspected Inflammatory Arthritis \u201d for patient with \nsuspected arthritis  or synovitis [ 8]. \nSpecial Imaging  Considerations  \nKnee radiographs  should include at least one frontal projection of one or both knees (anteroposterior, Rosenberg, \nor tunnel), a tangential patellar view , and a lateral view of the affected knee [2,9]. Standing radiographs more \naccurately reflect medial and lateral compartment cartilage loss than supine radiographs with the posteromedial and posterolateral joint compartments  more accurately assessed using a weight -bearing flexion posteroanterior \nradiograph [9,10]. \nDiscussion of Pro cedures by Variant  \nVariant 1:  Adult or child greater than or equal to 5  year s of age .

It is general  \nagreement  that radiographs  should be obtained  and the clinical  decision  rule should not be applied  for patients with \ngross  deformity  [3], a palpable  mass  [10], a penetrating  injury,  prosthetic  hardware,  an unreliable  clinical  history  \nor physical  examination  secondary  to multiple  injuries  [3,10] , altered  mental  status (eg, head  injury, drug or alcohol  \nuse, dementia)  [3,10] , neuropathy (eg, paraplegia,  diabetes)  [3,10] , or a history  suggesting  increased  risk of fracture."], ["In randomized studies of patients  with knee  injuries  [23,24] , \nMRI findings  shortened  the diagnostic  completion  workup,  reduced  the number  of additional  diagnostic  procedures,  \nand improve d quality  of life in the first 6 weeks,  potentially  reduc ing productivity loss. \nA retrospective study  by Cecava et al [25] showed  that knee  radiography  is a highly specific screening  test for \ninternal  derangement  in patients  <40 years old with acute knee injury.  In this patient population,  knee  effusion  >10 \nmm on lateral  radiograph  should prompt  consideration  for the knee  MRI examination , which  can potentially  \ndecrease delayed  diagnosis,  improve  patient  outcomes,  and decrease  disability  [25].  \nMagee et al [26] reported  96% sensitivity  and 97% specificity  of 3T MRI in the detection  of meniscal  tears in \ncorrelation  with arthroscopy . However,  a study  by Van Dyck  et al [21] showed  similar  high sensitivities  and \nspeci ficities  of routine  3T and 1.5T MRI examinations  in the evaluation  of meniscal  and ACL  tears with \narthroscopic  correlation.  Routine  3T MRI  protocol  did not significantly  improve  accuracy  for evaluating  the knee  \nmenisci  and ACL  compared  with a similar  1.5T MRI  protocol.  \nMRI can diagnose  the pattern s and severity  of bone  marrow  contusions  that frequently  have  an association  with the \nspecific mechanisms of injury  and can predict  associated  soft-tissue injuries  [27,28] .

As on MRI,  secondary  signs,  such as buckling  of the posterior  cruciate \nligament , were also useful  in their diagnosis.  In this study , multidetector  CT showed a low sensitivity  for other  soft-\ntissue injuries  at the knee;  however,  its high specificity  indicated  that apparent  posterior  cruciate  ligament , meniscal,  \nand collateral  ligament  tears can reliably  be treated  as true-positive  findings  [15]. \nThe dual-energy  CT virtual  noncalcium  technique  can subtract  calcium  from  cancellous bone,  allowing  detection  \n[16-18] and possibly grading of the post-traumatic  bone  marrow  contusions  [18]. \nHowever,  MRI is superior  to CT in detection  of bone  marrow  abnormalities  and meniscal  and ligamentous  injuries  \nand may be subsequently  performed  as clinically  indicated. \nMR Arth rography  Knee  \nWith  negative radiographs,  MR arthrography  is not routinely  used as the next imaging study  for the evaluation  of \nsuspected  occult  knee  fractures or internal  derangement . \nMRA Knee  \nWith  negative radiographs,  MRA  is not routinely  used as the next imaging study  for the evaluation  of suspected  \noccult  knee  fractures or internal  derangement . \nMRI Knee  \nMRI has many  distinct advantages for the evaluation  of the injured  knee  in the setting  of negative  radiographs.  \nThe majority  of patients  (93.5%)  who present  with acute  knee  injuries  in the emergency  department  sustained  soft-\ntissue injuries  rather  than osseous injuries  [19].

New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or \npatients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee \npain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the \norigin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. \nSubchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed \nspontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to \nelderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs \noften initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, \nand progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is \nsuspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria\n\u00ae \ntopic on \u201c Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae \u201d [28]. \nSome patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using \nquantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs \nexhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ]. \nPatellofemoral car tilage loss is also associated with chronic knee pain , with active knee pain correlated with \nBMLs [30,31]. Similar to CT, MRI can calculate various anatomic measurements associated with patellofemoral \nsubluxation/dislocation and lateral patellofemoral friction syndrome [32-34]. Bone marrow edema in the classic \nlocation for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also \ndifferentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise \ntherapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. \nOther etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat \npad impingement syndromes, Hoffa\u2019s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome, adhesive \ncapsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes , \nand osteonecrosis [15, 19,36-45].  \nMRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a \njoint effusion. However, contrast -enhanced images ma y be more accurate in diagnosing other causes of chronic \nknee pain , such as Hoffa\u2019s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome, and adhesive \ncapsulitis [15].  In particular, enh ancing synovitis thicker than 2 mm in Hoffa\u2019s fat is correlated with peripatellar \npain [46]. Contrast -enhanced MRI is also useful in quantifying the degree of synovitis and in evaluating \nconditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis [ 17,42,47,48].  \nMR Arthrography  Knee  \nMR arthrography performed with an intra -articular injection of dilute gadolinium solution is typically not \nindicated as a second exam ination  but rather reserved for patients with known prior meniscal surgery, chondral \nand osteochondral lesions , and suspected loose bodies  [10].", "US is an excellent  imaging  modality  for the diagnosis  of quadriceps tendon tears \n[42] with good performance  in the evaluation  of the meniscal  [44-46] and ligamentous  [47-49] injuries.

Kransdo rf, MD.q \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nAnkle pain is considered chronic when symptoms persist > 6 weeks. Chronic ankle  pain can be caused by a variety \nof osseous or soft -tissue abnormalities, either alone or in combination. For assessing chronic ankle pain, there are \nmultiple imaging options, including radiography, stress radiography,  computed tomography (CT)  radionuclide \nbone scanning, ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and various injection procedures. Injection \nproce dures include arthrography, CT arthrography, MR arthrography, and diagnostic injection with anesthetic \nagents. Although there are numerous causes for chronic ankle pain, common etiologies include osteoarthritis, \nosteochondral injury, tendon abnormalities, ligament abnormalities and instability, and impingement.  \nOverview of Imaging Modalities  \nRadiography Radiographs can provide information about the osseous and soft -tissue structures about the ankle. Routine \nradiographs of the ankle typically include anteroposterior, lateral, and mortise views, the latter obtained by internally rotating the foot 15 to 20 degrees.  Stress radiographs can be used to assess ankle instability  [1,2]; \nhowever , some have questioned their accuracy [3 ,4]. \nCT \nCT is not routinely used as a first -line imaging tool in chronic ankle pain, but it is more sensitive than \nradiographs, particularly for osseous abnormalities  [5]. CT arthrography may be more accurate than MR \narthrography for the identification of osteochondral abnormalities  [6]. \nBone Scan  \nConventional planar bone scintigraphy can assess osseous pathology.  More recently, single -photon emission \ncomputed tomogr aphy (SPECT)  combined with CT has been shown to provide additional information compared \nwith clinical diagnosis and conventional bone scintigraphy for the evaluation of impingement syndromes and soft -\ntissue pathology [7]. In addition, SPECT/CT abnormalities have been shown to significantly correlate with pain  in \nosteochondral lesions  [8]. \nUS \nUS can be used to evaluate for soft -tissue abnormalities, including tendon and ligament tears. In inflammatory \narthritis, it can help in the assessment of disease activity and severity as well as detect subclinical pathology in \nearly disease or after treatment [9 ]. US is ideal for dynamic assessment of peroneal tendon instability [10] and can \nbe used to guide interventions  [11]. Compared with some other modalities, US is less prone to artifacts, such as \nsusceptibility, motion, magic angle , and streak artifact, but dynamic assessment may be limited in cases of pain.  \nMRI  \nMRI is the imaging test that globally evaluates all anatomic structures, including ligaments, tendons, cartilage, \nand bone  [12,13]. Most studies have shown that MRI is highly accurate for evaluation of ligament, tendon,  and \n \naPrincipal Author and Panel Chair,  VA San Diego Healthcare System, San Diego, California . bResearch Author, University of California San Diego Medical \nCenter, San Diego, California.  cUniversity of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.  dRush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois; \nAmerican College of Physicians.  ePenn State Milton S.

Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral \nand oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar \ncoalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs \non the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have \nbeen found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable \nmethods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  \nRadiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review \nby Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for \nradiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.  \nRadiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  \nusually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, \nosteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite \nversus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess \nwith radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton\u2019s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other \ncauses of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg\u2019s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals \nor soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . \nThough radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in \npatients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The \ncombination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a \nspecificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15]. \nUS Foot  \nUltrasound (US) is usually not indicate d as the first imaging  study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain, but may \nbe performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of pathologic conditions of the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, \nand other conditions such as tarsal tunnel syndrome, Morton\u2019s  neuroma , plantar plate tears,  and intermetatarsal \nbursitis. \nVariant 2: Persistent posttraumatic foot pain. Radiographs negative or equivocal. Clinical concern includes \ncomplex regional pain syndrome type I. Next imaging study.  \n3-Phase Bone Scan Foot  \nA 3-phase bone scan may be useful in cases of suspected complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type I reflex \nsympathetic dystrophy , and several imaging findings have been described.", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 10 Chronic Ankle Pain  Variant 6: Chronic ankle pain. Ankle radiographs normal or nonspecific, suspected ankle impingement \nsyndrome. Next study . \nImaging can also be used to diagnose ankle impingement syndromes, which can occur in the anterolateral, \nanterior, anteromedial, posteromedial, and posterior aspects of the ankle joint [62 -71].  \nMR Arthrography  \nMR arthrography has been found to be an accurate method for assessing both anterolateral and anteromedial \nimpingement with the advantage of joint capsule distention by intra -articular contrast injection [68, 69]. \nUS \nOne study involving anterolateral ankle impingement compared US to arthroscopic findings. The study found US had a sensitivity and specificity of 77% and 57%, respectively [ 70]. US also showed abnormal soft tissues in \nanterolateral impingement, with a reported accuracy of 100% in one study [72]. \nMRI  \nStudies on the accuracy of MRI in diagno sing anterolateral impingement syndrome have drawn varying \nconclusions, which may be related to varying MRI magnet strengths and inconsistent protocols [73]. Comparing MRI wi th surgical findings, studies have shown sensitivities between 75 % to 83% and specificity between 75 % to \n100% for the diagnosis of anterolateral impingement [73, 74]. \nOne study found that , when compared with arthroscopy,  fat-suppressed, IV contrast -enhanced, 3 -D gradient -\nrecalled echo imaging was sensitive for the evaluation of synovitis of the ankle associated wit h trauma (92%), \nwhereas it was specific for soft -tissue impingement evaluation (97%) when the ankle was divided into four \ncompartments: the anterolateral gutter, anteromedial gutter, anterior recess, and posterior recess [75].  \nMRI is useful in confirming the diagnosis, evaluating patients with an uncertain clinical diagnosis, and planning \nsurgery. Additionally, it can help exclude other pathologic entities that may mimic or coexist with impinge ment \nsyndromes. However, MRI features supportive of impingement may be present in asymptomatic individuals, and \nan accurate diagnosis requires careful correlation of imaging features findings with clinical findings [76]. There \nare only limited reports on the use of MRI for the other forms of ankle impingement syndrome, so its accuracy in \nthese conditions is not well established [62, 64,67,68]. \nCT Arthrography  \nOne study involving anterolateral ankle impingement compared CT arthrography to arthroscopic findings. The \nstudy found that CT arthrography had a sensitivity and specificity of 97% and 71%, respectively [77].  \nImage-guided Anesthetic Injection  \nFluoroscopic  or US-guided injection s have been shown as an effective treatment for some  ankle impingement \nsyndromes [78,79]. \nBone Scan with SPECT or SPECT/CT  \nRecently, SPECT combined with CT has been shown to provide additional information compared with clinical diagnosis and conventional bone scintigraphy for the evaluation of impingement syndromes and soft -tissue \npathology [7]. One study found that SPECT/CT provided information not sus pected on clinical diagnosis in 56% \nof cases with impingement syndromes or soft -tissue pathology [7 ]. \nCT \nCT may be useful for depiction of osseous causes of imp ingement, such as chronic abnormalities between the \ntalus and an os trigonum or fractures of the lateral tubercle of the talus or os trigonum [62].  \nArthrography  \nArthrography is not routinely used for the evaluation of ankle impingement syndromes.  \nRadiography Stress views are not routinely used for the evaluation of ankle impingement syndromes.  \nVariant 7: Chronic ankle pain.

For the evaluation of deep deltoid ligament tears, MRI is \nboth sensitive and specific compared with arthroscopy, with reported values of 96% and 98%, respectively [53].  \nWith regard to tears of the tibiofibular ligaments of the tibiofibular syndesmosis, MRI has a reported accuracy of 100% [54]. Additionally, MRI can also demonstrate interosseous membrane tears [55]. MRI offers the advantage \nof evaluating for injuries associated with or mimicking lateral instability that may not be diagnosed on stress radiography such as tenosynovitis, tendon injury, and osteochondral lesions [56].

Ankle \neffusions may also be identified in the anterior ankle joint recess by radiography with 53% to 74% accuracy  [19]. \nThey are often associated with ligamentous injury or fracture [19]. The presence of ossific fragments can indicate \nligamentous injury or retinaculum avulsion [20], whereas periostitis can occur adjacent to tenosynovitis. \nRadiographs can also identify synovial osteochondromatosis and erosions from chronic synovitis.  \nCT \nCT is not routinely used as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain.  \nMRI  \nMRI is not routinely used as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain.  \nUS \nUS is not routinely used  as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain.  \nBone Scan  \nBone scan is not routinely used as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain.  \nVariant 2: Chronic ankle pain.

Next study.  \nWhen multiple sites of osteoarthritis  are present, it may be important to determine which joint is the cause of \nsymptoms.  \nImage-guided Anesthetic Injection  \nSeveral reports have indicated the effectiveness of fluo roscopic , CT, or US-guided anesthetic  [11] with or without \ncorticosteroid injection of joints to identify a source  of pain, which aids in surgical planning [ 21-25].  \nMRI  \nWhen degenerative changes of the ankle joint are diagnosed based on radiographs, MRI may be considered as the \nnext best examination to evaluate cartilage integrity, bone marrow, and associated soft tissues, such as ligaments \nand tendons, if these injuries are clinically suspected [13-15].  \nCT \nCT without  contrast may be helpful to visualize subchondral cysts [5 ]. \nUS \nUS is not routinely used for the evaluation of degenerative joint disease.  \nBone Scan  \nBone scan is not routinely used for the evaluation of degenerative joi nt disease.  \nArthrography  \nArthrography is not routinely used for the evaluation of degenerative joint disease.  \nMR Arthrography  \nMR arthrography is not routinely used for the evaluation of degenerative joint disease.  \nCT Arthrography  \nCT arthrography is not rou tinely used for the evaluation of degenerative joint disease.  \nVariant 3: Chronic ankle pain.

If this inju ry is associated with fracture, osseous cyst, or osteochondral defect, radiography may \nshow the abnormality; however, radiography often fails to show the extent of the osteochondral injury and will be", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 8 Acute Trauma to the Ankle  dislocation, with fractures involving the posterior facet, with associated massive swelling, or with  failure to regain \nsubtalar motion after a period of immobilizat ion [49]. \nCT with IV contrast is not ind icated in this scenario because soft-tissue abnormalities and fluid collections can be \nidentified on noncontr ast high -resolution CT studies. \nMRI Ankle  \nMRI of the ankle without IV contrast is most sensitive for evaluation of occult fractures with associated bone \nmarrow edema patterns, particularly in inversion injuries and persistent lateral ankle pain, as well  as presence and \nextent of soft -tissue injuries  [29]. Stress injuries of bone , including those of the weekend warrior , are best depicted \nby MRI  [50]. \nMRI is the reference standard for ligamentous injury and assessment of stability , which is particularly important in \nathletes, in whom determination of grade ( 1, 2, or 3) of syndesmotic ligament, anterior tibiofibular ligament , and \ndeltoid injuries is critical for treatment planning and return to sport assessment [51]. High -resolution evaluation of \nthe tendons and ligaments allows distinction between tendinopathy, sprain, and partial or complete tears.  \nLigament and tendon  injuries can occur without fracture on radiography . Gross terlinden et al [52] compared MR I \nand radiography and showed that 15% of ligamentous injuries ( including sprains , partial tears, and complete tears) \nat the syndesmosis in acute ankle injuries on MRI demonstrated no fracture on radiography. Presence o f bone bruise \nand adjacent soft -tissue edema have shown a higher association with acute ligamentous injuries ( anterior talofibular \nligament most common) and tendon abnormalities [53,54]  in patients with negative radiographs.  MRI can also help \nexclude Salter 1 fractures in the pediatric population [55]. \nRadiography Ankle  \nRepeat radiograph s are not typically the next study but may be of use to identify early callous formation at an occult \nfracture line or possible mineralization at a site of intramuscular hematoma if contusion occurred during trauma. \nRadiographs with better technique may assist in diagnosis of subtle injuries such as the lateral talar process avulsion , \nwhich  may erroneously be diagnosed as  a lateral ankle sprain  [37]. \nRadiography Ankle Stress Views  \nAlthough ankle stress views are not the typical next best study for this patient group, if  there is clinical evidence of \ninstability on physician maneuvers, ankle stress views may be of benefit for identification of occult avulsion injury \nat ligamentous attachments that may contribute t o widening of the joint spac e on radiographic stress views.  \nUS Ankle  \nUS is not typically  the next imaging study .

Although MRI had the highest sensitivity (96%), it was less specific than CT [5 ]. \nMRI is effective in determining osteochondral injury instability (sensitivity 97%), most commonly appearing as a \nhigh signal line deep to the os teochondral lesion on T2-weighted images or less commonly as a focal defect, an \narticular fracture, or an adjacent cyst [28]. MRI has also been used to stage these lesions preoperatively with an \naccuracy of 81% [29] and to assess osteochondral abnormalities after cartilage repair [30]. Although MRI may be \nless reliable than CT arthrography for talar cartilaginous lesions (accuracy between 76 % to 88%) [6], high-\nresolution MRI using a microscopy coil (e g, a 4 -cm receive-only surface coil) can assist in detecting small, \nclinically relevant features of talar osteochondral lesions that may be missed on standard MRI, including \nosteochondral junction separation due to focal collapse of the subchondral bone, reparative cartilage hypertrophy, \nand bone separation in the absence of cartilage fracture [31].  \nCT Arthrography  \nThe introduction of contrast into the ankle joi nt prior to CT will outline a cartilage surface defect, assisting in \nlesion detection and assessment for instability. One study comparing CT arthrography and MR arthrography for \ntalar cartilaginous lesions found an accuracy between 76 % to 88% using MR arthrography compared to 90% to \n92% for CT arthrography, suggesting that CT arthrography may be more reliable [6 ]. \nMR Arthrography  \nThe introduction of contrast into the  ankle joint prior to MRI will outline a cartilage surface defect, assisting in \nlesion detection and assessment for instability.

However, CT was \nmore specific (99%) but less sensitive then MRI [5 ]. \nBone Scan  with SPECT or  SPECT /CT \nWhen osteochondral injuries are associated with fracture, osseous cyst, or osteochondral defect, bone scans may \nshow the abnormality. One study evaluating the role of SPECT/CT in assessing osteochondral defects in the ankle \nfound that this study affected the surgeon\u2019s ultimate decision regarding treatment in 48 % to 52% of cases , as it \nallowed for improved evaluation of the subchondral bone and subchondral bone plate [32].

Because of these limitations, \narthrography  has now largely been supplanted by cross-sectional imaging. Fluoroscopic -guided intra -articular \ninjections are chiefly used as a first step when performing arthrographic  computed tomography ( CT) and \nmagnetic resonance imaging (MR I) studies [8]. \nMRI  \nWrist MRI accurately depicts abnormalities of the bones and bone marrow, articular cartilage, intrinsic and \nextrinsic ligaments, TFCC, synovium, tendons, and neurovascular structures, making it a powerful study for \nchronic pai n caused by diverse etiologies.  \nA dedicated receiver coil or transmit -receive coil is necessary to provide the signal -to-noise ratio needed for high-\nresolution, high-contrast MRI of the wrist [9 ]. MR arthrography \u2014either with direct contrast injection into one  or \nmore wrist compartments or performed indirectly after intravenous (IV) contrast administration \u2014can enhance the \nyield of the study for diagnosing internal wrist derangements, especially abnormalities of the ligaments, articular cartilage, and TFCC of the wrist. MRI performed with a 3.0 T magnet and a dedicated coil provides better signal -\nto-noise ratio and better contrast compared with wrist MR I performed with 1.5 T  or lower field strength systems \n[10,11]. \nCT \nCT of the wr ist is used primarily when high-det ail imaging of bone cortex or trabeculae is needed. In patients with \nchronic wrist pain and prior fractures, CT is typically the study of choice to evaluate fracture healing and joint \ncongruence. When a radiographically occult fracture is suspected as the cause of a patient\u2019s chronic pain, either \nCT or MRI can be used [12]. Advantages of CT over MRI for the wrist include  its ability to obtain high -resolution \nimages of both wrists simultaneously and the much shorter acquisition times for CT. These factors make CT the \npreferred examination for suspected distal radioulnar joint subluxation, where images of both wrists can be  \nobtained in both supination and pronation [1 ,13]. A disadvantage of CT  is its lower sensitivity to soft -tissue \nabnormalities  compared with MRI.  \nHigh-resolution (typically multidetector) CT of the wrist following contrast injection into one or more wrist \ncompartments (CT arthrography) is a powerful tool for diagnosing intra -articular abnormalities [14,15]. The \nintraobserver agreement on CT arthrogram images is extremely high and better than that reported for MRI \n[14,16]. \nUS \nUS of the wrist is useful for examining extra -articular soft tissues, such as suspected ganglion cyst s [17], because \nits accuracy is similar to that of MRI. US can also be used to diagnose abnormalities of the flexor and extensor \ntendons and tendon sheaths. For de Quervain disease (stenosing tenosynovitis of the abductor pollicis lon gus and \nextensor pollicis brevis tendon compartment), preoperative identification of a septum or subcompartmentalization \nwithin the first dorsal compartment with US  may affect surgical management [18 ,19]. \nIn patients with suspected or established rheumatoid arthritis (RA), US examination of the wrist and selected \nfinger joints can identify erosions and active synovit is (with the use of power Doppler), findings that influence \nearly diagnosis and treatment decisions [20]. Using US to measure the size of the median nerve is a  validated  \ntechnique in patients with clinical symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome [21-24].  \nIn addition, w rist US is a useful technique to guide therapeutic intr a-articular and other soft -tissue injections [25].  \nDiscussion of Procedures by Variant  \nVariant 1: Chronic wrist pain.

Ankle radiographs normal or nonspecific, suspected ankle impingement \nsyndrome. Next study . \nImaging can also be used to diagnose ankle impingement syndromes, which can occur in the anterolateral, \nanterior, anteromedial, posteromedial, and posterior aspects of the ankle joint [62 -71].  \nMR Arthrography  \nMR arthrography has been found to be an accurate method for assessing both anterolateral and anteromedial \nimpingement with the advantage of joint capsule distention by intra -articular contrast injection [68, 69]. \nUS \nOne study involving anterolateral ankle impingement compared US to arthroscopic findings. The study found US had a sensitivity and specificity of 77% and 57%, respectively [ 70]. US also showed abnormal soft tissues in \nanterolateral impingement, with a reported accuracy of 100% in one study [72]. \nMRI  \nStudies on the accuracy of MRI in diagno sing anterolateral impingement syndrome have drawn varying \nconclusions, which may be related to varying MRI magnet strengths and inconsistent protocols [73]. Comparing MRI wi th surgical findings, studies have shown sensitivities between 75 % to 83% and specificity between 75 % to \n100% for the diagnosis of anterolateral impingement [73, 74]. \nOne study found that , when compared with arthroscopy,  fat-suppressed, IV contrast -enhanced, 3 -D gradient -\nrecalled echo imaging was sensitive for the evaluation of synovitis of the ankle associated wit h trauma (92%), \nwhereas it was specific for soft -tissue impingement evaluation (97%) when the ankle was divided into four \ncompartments: the anterolateral gutter, anteromedial gutter, anterior recess, and posterior recess [75].  \nMRI is useful in confirming the diagnosis, evaluating patients with an uncertain clinical diagnosis, and planning \nsurgery. Additionally, it can help exclude other pathologic entities that may mimic or coexist with impinge ment \nsyndromes. However, MRI features supportive of impingement may be present in asymptomatic individuals, and \nan accurate diagnosis requires careful correlation of imaging features findings with clinical findings [76]. There \nare only limited reports on the use of MRI for the other forms of ankle impingement syndrome, so its accuracy in \nthese conditions is not well established [62, 64,67,68]. \nCT Arthrography  \nOne study involving anterolateral ankle impingement compared CT arthrography to arthroscopic findings. The \nstudy found that CT arthrography had a sensitivity and specificity of 97% and 71%, respectively [77].  \nImage-guided Anesthetic Injection  \nFluoroscopic  or US-guided injection s have been shown as an effective treatment for some  ankle impingement \nsyndromes [78,79]. \nBone Scan with SPECT or SPECT/CT  \nRecently, SPECT combined with CT has been shown to provide additional information compared with clinical diagnosis and conventional bone scintigraphy for the evaluation of impingement syndromes and soft -tissue \npathology [7]. One study found that SPECT/CT provided information not sus pected on clinical diagnosis in 56% \nof cases with impingement syndromes or soft -tissue pathology [7 ]. \nCT \nCT may be useful for depiction of osseous causes of imp ingement, such as chronic abnormalities between the \ntalus and an os trigonum or fractures of the lateral tubercle of the talus or os trigonum [62].  \nArthrography  \nArthrography is not routinely used for the evaluation of ankle impingement syndromes.  \nRadiography Stress views are not routinely used for the evaluation of ankle impingement syndromes.  \nVariant 7: Chronic ankle pain.

Patients  may report  symptoms  of \nswelling,  pain,  restricted  range  of motion,  stiffness,  and numbness  or tingling  [1]. There is a wide  differential  \ndiagnosis  for chronic  elbow  pain, including osseous,  soft tissue,  cartil aginous , and nerve -related  abnormalities.  \nEpicondylalgia , caused  by tendinosis  of the common  extensor  tendon laterally  (\u201ctennis elbow\u201d)  or medially  the \ncommon  flexor  tendon  (\u201cgolfer\u2019s  elbow \u201d), is the most  common  cause of chronic  elbow  pain,  estimated  to occur in \n1% to 3% of the population  [2]. Epicondylalgia  is associated  with lost workdays  and a significant  economic  burden  \n[3]. Both  occupational  and recreational  causes play a role in development  of epicondylalgia  as well as other  causes  \nof chronic  elbow  pain,  including  biceps tendinopathy,  osteochondral  injuries, collateral  ligament  tears,  and cubital  \ntunnel  syndrome.  \nImaging plays  an important  role in assessment  of chronic  elbow  pain.  Electromyography  assists in the workup \nrelated  to nerve  symptoms.  Management  for epicondylalgia  and osteoarthritis  includes  conservative measures such \nas rest, activity  modification, analgesia,  physical  therapy,  and corticosteroid  injections. Surgery  may be indicated  \nfor more  severe or refractory  cases and cases of collateral  ligament  injury,  biceps injury, cubital  tunnel  syndrome,  \nor osteochondral  abnormalities.  \nSpecial Imaging  Considerations  \nStress radiographs  to detect  medial  joint line opening  and/or  asymmetry  to the contralateral  elbow  are available to \nevaluate valgus  instability  of the elbow.  \nInitial Imaging  Definition \nInitial imaging  is defined  as imaging  at the beginning of the care episode for the medical  condition defined  by the \nvariant.  More  than one procedure  can be considered  usually  appropriate  in the initial imaging  evaluation  when : \n\u2022 There are procedures  that are equivalent  alternatives (ie, only one procedure  will be ordered  to \nprovide  the clinical  information  to effectively  manage the patient\u2019s  care)  \nOR \n\u2022 There are complementary  procedures  (ie, more  than one procedure  is ordered  as a set or \nsimultaneously  where each procedure  provides  unique  clinical  information  to effectively  manage  \nthe patient\u2019s  care).  \n \naPenn  State  Milton  S.

Thus,  T2-weighted  images  \nare recommended for the evaluation  of loose  bodies  in the elbow  [17]. MRI may also show  the presence of enlarged  \nplica,  which  can result  in symptoms  of locking  and/or  pain with extension  [15]. MRI is often  suggested  as the initial  \nstudy to assess for osteochondral  lesion  [12,17] . MRI  is less sensitive  than radiographs  in the detection  of \nheterotopic  ossification/calcification  [18]. Similar  to MR arthrography,  MRI elbow  is limited  in the evaluation  of \ncartilage defects [16]. \nUS Elbow  \nAlthough US may demonstrate  early -stage osteochondral  lesions and medial  epicondylar  fragmentation  [10], the \ndetails  of an osteochondral  lesion  are better  defined  by CT arthrography or MR arthrography.

However,  it has poor sensitivity  in the detection  of early  stress fractures  [20]. \nMR Arthrography  Elbow  \nThere is limited  evidence to the support  the use of MR arthrography elbow  for the detection  of occult  fractures  \nfollowing  radiographs.  \nMRI Elbow  \nMRI is as sensitive  as 3-phase bone  scan for detection  of stress fractures  [20]. MRI  findings  include  bone  marrow  \nedema and/or  periosteal  fluid  at the site of abnormality  [20]. MRI  elbow  has the advantage  of demonstrating \nassociated  soft tissue injuries.  \nUS Elbow  \nUS can demonstrate a lipohemarthrosis  in children  with occult  elbow  fractures [23].

Patients  may report  symptoms  of \nswelling,  pain,  restricted  range  of motion,  stiffness,  and numbness  or tingling  [1]. There is a wide  differential  \ndiagnosis  for chronic  elbow  pain, including osseous,  soft tissue,  cartil aginous , and nerve -related  abnormalities.  \nEpicondylalgia , caused  by tendinosis  of the common  extensor  tendon laterally  (\u201ctennis elbow\u201d)  or medially  the \ncommon  flexor  tendon  (\u201cgolfer\u2019s  elbow \u201d), is the most  common  cause of chronic  elbow  pain,  estimated  to occur in \n1% to 3% of the population  [2]. Epicondylalgia  is associated  with lost workdays  and a significant  economic  burden  \n[3]. Both  occupational  and recreational  causes play a role in development  of epicondylalgia  as well as other  causes  \nof chronic  elbow  pain,  including  biceps tendinopathy,  osteochondral  injuries, collateral  ligament  tears,  and cubital  \ntunnel  syndrome.  \nImaging plays  an important  role in assessment  of chronic  elbow  pain.  Electromyography  assists in the workup \nrelated  to nerve  symptoms.  Management  for epicondylalgia  and osteoarthritis  includes  conservative measures such \nas rest, activity  modification, analgesia,  physical  therapy,  and corticosteroid  injections. Surgery  may be indicated  \nfor more  severe or refractory  cases and cases of collateral  ligament  injury,  biceps injury, cubital  tunnel  syndrome,  \nor osteochondral  abnormalities.  \nSpecial Imaging  Considerations  \nStress radiographs  to detect  medial  joint line opening  and/or  asymmetry  to the contralateral  elbow  are available to \nevaluate valgus  instability  of the elbow.  \nInitial Imaging  Definition \nInitial imaging  is defined  as imaging  at the beginning of the care episode for the medical  condition defined  by the \nvariant.

New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or \npatients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee \npain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the \norigin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. \nSubchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed \nspontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to \nelderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs \noften initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, \nand progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is \nsuspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria\n\u00ae \ntopic on \u201c Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae \u201d [28]. \nSome patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using \nquantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs \nexhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ]. \nPatellofemoral car tilage loss is also associated with chronic knee pain , with active knee pain correlated with \nBMLs [30,31]. Similar to CT, MRI can calculate various anatomic measurements associated with patellofemoral \nsubluxation/dislocation and lateral patellofemoral friction syndrome [32-34]. Bone marrow edema in the classic \nlocation for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also \ndifferentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise \ntherapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. \nOther etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat \npad impingement syndromes, Hoffa\u2019s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome, adhesive \ncapsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes , \nand osteonecrosis [15, 19,36-45].  \nMRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a \njoint effusion. However, contrast -enhanced images ma y be more accurate in diagnosing other causes of chronic \nknee pain , such as Hoffa\u2019s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome, and adhesive \ncapsulitis [15].  In particular, enh ancing synovitis thicker than 2 mm in Hoffa\u2019s fat is correlated with peripatellar \npain [46]. Contrast -enhanced MRI is also useful in quantifying the degree of synovitis and in evaluating \nconditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis [ 17,42,47,48].  \nMR Arthrography  Knee  \nMR arthrography performed with an intra -articular injection of dilute gadolinium solution is typically not \nindicated as a second exam ination  but rather reserved for patients with known prior meniscal surgery, chondral \nand osteochondral lesions , and suspected loose bodies  [10]."], ["ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 4 Chronic  Elbow  Pain CHRONIC ELBOW PAIN  \nExpert  Panel  on Musculoskeletal  Imaging:  Jonelle M.

Radiographs normal or nonspecific. Suspect carpal tunnel syndrome.  Next \nstudy. \nUS Wrist \nSeveral meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the \ncarpal  tunnel  inlet) is highly accurate for identifying carpal  tunnel syndrome  diagnosed clinically or with the \ncombination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US \nvaries depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the \nmeasurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary \nexamination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel \nsyndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal \ntunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, \nclinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of \ncarpal tunnel syndrome. US may be appropriate in cases where this initial evaluation is equivocal.  \nMRI Wrist  \nHistorically, carpal tunnel syndrome has been diagnosed based on clinical signs and sympt oms and confirmed by \nthe results of electrodiagnostic studies [67]. MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in cases in which this  \ninitial evaluation is equivocal. The MRI findings that have been reported in wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome \u2014\nincluding nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing\u2014may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value \nin patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68]. In rare cases of secondary carpal tunnel syndrome, MRI may identify \na mass lesion compressing the median nerve. There is some evidence that the length of T2 hyperintensity in the \nmedian nerve can help prognosticate the success of surgery [69] and that the shape and signal of the nerve predict \nclinical response to a steroid injection in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome [70 ].

This \nlesion can be identified by absence of ulnar collateral ligament and the presence of a hypoechoic mass proximal to \nthe apex of the metacarpal tubercle [64]. Dynamic examination shows the relationship of the aponeurosis to the \nretracted ligament stump [65] . \nUS allows for diagnosis of pulley system injuries [ 66,67]. \nBone Scan Hand \nBone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  \nVariant 6: Initial radiographs showing metaca rpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, or distal \ninterphalangeal joint malalignment in the absence of fracture. Next imaging study.  \nCT Hand  \nCT has limited use for the diagnosis of soft -tissue injuries of the fingers.  \nMRI Hand  \nMRI is ideal for evaluating tendon injuries and helping with surgical planning [58]. MRI may be used to assess \ncapsule and collateral ligament injuries of the proximal interphalangeal  and metacarpophalangeal joints [68]. \nFor flexor tendon injuries, Rubin et al [ 69] reported a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of  100% in cadavers.  \nDrap\u00e9 et al  [58] reported sensitivity and specificity of 100% for diagnosis of tendon re -tears after flexor tend on \nrepair and a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 100% for diagnosis of peritendinous adhesions in 63 injured \nfingers.  Jersey finger refers to avulsion injury of flexor digitorum profundus from  insertion at base of distal \nphalanx. In patients with jers ey finger, MRI is commonly used to evaluate the level of tendon retraction, the \nquality of the tendon stump, and the associated injuries including pulley injuries [16]. In clinically equivocal \ncases, MRI may demonstrate injury to the central slip or the extensor hood [ 16]. \nMRI allows for the assessment of pulley system lesions [ 66,67]. MRI can accurately depict the pulley system, \nparticularly the A2 and A4 pulleys, with lower sensitivity for A3 and A5 pulleys [ 70]. Hauger et al  [70] reported \ndirect identification of A2  and A4 pulleys in 12 of 12 cases (100%) and direct diagnosis of an abnormal A2 pulley \nin 100% and A4 pulley in 91% of 33 cases.  \nFor volar plat e injuries, MRI may be used to diagnose tears that do not involve the underlying bone [71]. This is \nimportant  because untreated lesions can result in contractures or joint laxity [ 72]. \nMRI of the extensor system has not been as well studied as that of the flexor system.  Drap\u00e9 et al [73] reported a \nsensitivity of 89 % to 92% for evaluation of normal sagittal bands of the extensor hood.  For the detection of \nextensor hood injuries, MRI sensitivity ranges from 28% to 85% [ 74]. \nMRI is especially useful for detection of ulnar collateral ligament and radial collateral ligament injuries.  \nPfirrmann et al [74] reported a sensitivity of 67% and a specificity of 91% for collateral ligament injuries of the \nlesser metacarpophalangeal joints. With MR arthrography, sensitivity and specificity increased to 75% and 98%, \nrespectively [74].", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 12 Chronic Wrist Pain  CT Wrist  \nCT, with or without IV  contrast, is not routinely used to further e valuate ulnar -sided chronic wrist pain when \nradiographs are normal or nonspecific.  \nBone Scan  Wrist  \nBone scan is not routinely used to further evaluate ulnar -sided chronic wrist pain when radiographs are normal or \nnonspecific . \nVariant 6: Radial -sided chroni c wrist pain.  Radiographs normal or nonspecific . Next study.   \nMRI Wrist  \nMRI is accurate for diagnosing scapholunate ligament tears [8,10,38,39], and noncontrast -enhanced MRI is \nusually appropriate in this scenario . IV contrast seldom provides added benefit in patients w ith radial -sided wrist \npain but may increase sensitivity for ligament lesions if MR arthrography is desired but direct joint injection is not \nfeasible.  \nMR Arthrography  Wrist  \nDirect MR arthrography (with contrast injection either into the radiocarpal joint or into all three  compartments of \nthe wrist) may be appropriate in this scenario; the examination has higher sensitivity than noncontrast -enhanced \nMRI\u2014even when performed at 3.0 T \u2014for diagnosis of complete and incomplete scapholunate and lunotriquetral \nligament tears [3 ,8,38]. For the scapholunate ligament, direct MR  arthrography also allows more accurate \ndetermination of which specific segments of the ligament are torn compared to conventional MRI [43], which has \nimportant biomechanical implications for wrist stability. Direct MR arthrography also has an advantage over \nnoncontrast -enhanced MRI for diagnosing extrinsic ligament abnormalities [44].  \nCT Arthrography  Wrist  \nThe accuracy of CT arthrography and MR arthrography are similar for lesions of the scapholunate ligament [8 ]. \nCompared to conventional MRI, CT arthrography may be more sensitive for tears of the biomechanically \nimportant dorsal ligament fibers [16]. In contrast to MRI and MR arthrography, CT arthrography is less sensitive \nfor diagnosis of extra -articular findings (like ganglion cysts and tendon disorders) t hat can cause radial -sided pain.  \nCT arthrography may be appropriate in this scenario.  \nCT Wrist  \nCT, with or without IV contrast,  is not routinely used to further evaluate chronic radial -sided wrist pain when \nradiographs are normal or nonspecific.  \nUS Wrist  \nWhile some investigators have tried high-resolution US with or  without arthrography for diagnosing intrinsic \nligament [41,42], its sensitivity in comparison to MRI, MR arthrography, and CT arthrography is unknown. \nAdditionally, imaging with US is largely limited to the dorsal fibers of the ligaments [42]. US may be appropriate \nin cases of suspected de Quervain disease (stenosing tenosynovitis of the abductor pollicis longus and extensor \npollicis brevis tendon compartment), where preoperative identification of a septum or subcompartmentalization \nwithin the first dorsal compartment with US may affect surgical management [18,19]. US may be appropriate in \npatients with radial -sided pain in cases where extra-articular pathology is the primary consideration.  \nArthrography  Wrist  \nConventional (x-ray) arthrography has largely been supplanted by CT arthrogra phy and MR arthrography because \nthese cross-sectional studies are better able to predict which fibers of the scapholunate ligament are torn and \nwhether any repairable fibers remain , both of which are important features that affect operative management . \nAdditionally, while fibrocartilage and ligament perforations are moderately associated with ulnar -sided wrist pain, \nthere is a poor correlation between ligament lesions and radial -sided pain [45]. Furthermore, conventional \narthrography is unable to show extra -articular findings (like ganglion cysts and tendon disorders) that can cause \nradial -sided pain, further limiting its usefulness in  this patient population .", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 10 Chronic Wrist Pain  importantly, though, the finding of enhancing bone marrow \u201cedema\u201d (osteitis) on MRI studies in patients with \nearly RA is proving to be the best single predictor of future disease progression and functional dete rioration, even \ncompared to serologies and clinical measures [27, 28,32-34].  \nUS Wrist  \nThe diagnosis of a specific inflammatory arthritis is typically established based on clinical and laboratory \nanalysis. Advanced imaging is usually performed to determine disease activity, guide management decisions, and prognosticate outcomes. In patients with RA, US  of the wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints can  show \ninflammation  as active synovitis. Identifying active synovitis with power Doppler assessment is a useful adjunct \nin making an early diagnosis of RA when a pati ent with early arthritis does not meet the 2010 criteria established \nby the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism [20]. The presence of \nsynovitis predicts progression of erosions [31 ] and erosions themselves [35]. US can also depict small bone \nerosions with high spatial resolution; h owever, US is less sensitive to erosions that occur on the radial or ulnar \nsides of the inner carpal bones because direct scanning of these regions is blocked, unlike the dorsal and volar \nbone surfaces. Furthermore, unlike MRI, US cannot show changes within the bone marrow, which are  the \nstrongest prognosticator s for disease progression in RA [27, 28,32-34].  In patients with established inflammatory \narthritis who are undergoing therapy, judging progression or reduction of synovitis may be more difficult with \nsequential US compared to sequential MRI.  \nMR Arthrography  Wrist  \nMR arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected inflammatory \narthritides. \nCT Wrist  \nWhile CT is more sensitive than radiographs for erosions, CT is not routinely used for the diagnosis and \nmanagement of patients with suspected inflammatory arthritides . \nCT Arthrography  Wrist  \nCT arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected inflammatory \narthritides. \nBone Scan  Wrist  \nBone scan does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients  with suspected inflammatory \narthritides. \nArthrography  Wrist  \nRadiographic arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected \ninflammatory arthritides. \nVariant 4: Chronic wrist pain.

Overall \nsensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs \nin the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral \nand oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar \ncoalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs \non the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have \nbeen found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable \nmethods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  \nRadiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review \nby Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for \nradiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.  \nRadiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  \nusually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, \nosteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite \nversus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess \nwith radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton\u2019s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other \ncauses of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg\u2019s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals \nor soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . \nThough radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in \npatients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The \ncombination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a \nspecificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15]. \nUS Foot  \nUltrasound (US) is usually not indicate d as the first imaging  study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain, but may \nbe performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of pathologic conditions of the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, \nand other conditions such as tarsal tunnel syndrome, Morton\u2019s  neuroma , plantar plate tears,  and intermetatarsal \nbursitis. \nVariant 2: Persistent posttraumatic foot pain.

Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a \nsignificant improvement in health-related quality of life with effective treatment of foot pain [3] . Estimating the \nprevalence of chron ic foot pain is challenging, because there is no consensus regarding the definition of chronic \npain in the literature. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines chronic pain as any pain persisting \npast the normal healing time, suggesting 3 months in case of chronic pain of benign causes.  \nWomen are more commonly affected , and forefoot conditions are more frequent. Persistent pain for more than 6  \nyears has been reported in 51% of women between 70 to 75 years of age [4]. Because of  the wide range of causes \nof chronic foot pain, assessment of these patients with imaging studies in addition to a dedicated clinical \nexamination is often needed [1] . \nThe guidelines of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons divide heel pain into plantar heel pain,  usually \nrelated to pathology of the plantar fascia, and posterior heel pain,  usually related to pathology of  the Achilles tendon, \nand treatment options vary from nonoperative treatments to surgical procedures [5] . \nChronic foot pain in children, symptoms related to soft -tissue or bone neoplasms and pain related to infectious \nconditions, inflammatory arthropathies, or other systemic diseases are beyond the scope of this document. \nEvaluation of patients with neuropathic foot or Charcot arthropathy is addressed in the ACR Appropriateness \nCriteria\u00ae topic on \u201c Suspected Osteomyelitis of the Foot in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus \u201d [6].

The most  commonly  accepted  form  of these  \nrules is the following:  \nA series of foot radiographs  is required  only if there  is pain in the midfoot  and any one of the \nfollowing:  1) point  bone  tenderness of the navicular;  2) point  bone  tenderness of the base of the fifth \nmetatarsal;  or 3) inability  to bear weight  or to walk  4 steps (immediately  after the injury  or at the \nemergency  department) . \nA meta -analysis (10 studies  encompassing  3,725  patients)  of the Ottawa rules for the foot showed  that these rules  \nhave  a sensitivity  of 99% and a median  specificity  of 26% for combined  evaluation  of the ankle  and midfoot  [1]. \nThe Ottawa rules for the ankle  and midfoot  have  been  shown  to be effective for the pediatric  population (>5 years \nof age) [2]. Including  the added  criterion  of swelling  yields  a sensitivity  and specificit y for fracture of 100%  and \n55% for the malleolar  zone and 50% and 40% for the midfoot,  respectively  [3,4] . \nExclusionary Criteria  \nMultiple  conditions  or scenarios preclude  the use of the Ottawa rules for determining  if imaging  is necessary  \n[5,6] . It has been  reported  that the Ottawa rules  for the foot should not be used or should be used with great  \ncaution  in the following  clinical  situations:  penetrating  trauma,  pregnancy,  any skin wound,  transferred  with \nradiographs  already  taken,  >10 days after trauma,  a return  visit for continued  traumatic  foot pain,  in the setting  of \npolytrauma,  altered  sensorium,  neurologic  abnormality  affecting  the foot, or underlying  bone  disease [7]. \nOther  clinical  scenarios of foot trauma  not directly  addressed  by the Ottawa rules  include  trauma  to the metatarsal  \nheads and toes and penetrating  trauma  with concern  for a foreign  body  in the soft tissues.

The utility of MRI in the detection of radiographically occult Chopart \nfractures has been demonstrated by Almeida et al [64] . Baker et al [71]  analyzed 31 occult fractures involving the \nankle and foot in h ockey players,  finding five occult fractures in the foot, all of which involved the navicular bone. \nPierre -Jerome et al [72] found 79% of cuboid fractures in the diabetic population that were radiographically occult \nusing MRI. MRI is also useful in the detection of occult fractures involving the fifth metatarsal bone (Jones fracture) \nand the subtalar join t [65,73] . There is no evidence in the literature supporting the routine use of contrast in the \ndiagnosi s of occult fractures.  \nMRI has replaced bone scans in the evaluation of symptomatic accessory ossicles. MRI allows optimal visualization \nof the bone marrow within the ossicle and visualization of the synchondrosis. Accessory ossicles may also be \nassociated  with tendon pathology, which is also well assessed on MRI [74]. MRI allows clear demonstration of the \nfindings often associated with posterior ankle impingement syndrome [75]. Contrast administration is not routinely \nperformed when assessing symptomatic accessory ossicles on MRI; however, contrast within a disrupted \nsynchondrosis may be demonstrated on MR arthrography stu dies [69]. \nUS Foot   \nAlthough not routinely performed, previous studies have demonstrated the role of US in the detection of occult foot \nfractures. On US, these can be seen as cortical irregularities and are frequently associated with soft -tissue injury in \nthe acute or subacute setting. Wang et al [76]  demonstrated 24 cases of radiographically occult ankle and foot \nfractures in 268 patients. Of these, foot fractures were found most frequently in the calcaneus and metatarsals, and \nless frequently in the navicular, cuboid , and cuneiform bones.  \nOn US, several findings have been reported in cases of painful accessory ossicles, including patients with posterior \nankle impingement syndrome ; however , optimal characterization of the synchondrosis is difficult on US [62] . High -\nresolution US offers some advantages over other imagin g modalities because it allows dynamic exploration of the \nfoot with further assessment of stability of the synchondrosis and tendon tears when present as well as direct clinical \ncorrelation and comparative evaluation with the asymptomatic foot [77] .

Because of  its ability to demonstrate signal intensity changes in the presence of \nmuscle denervation, MRI has been sho wn to be useful in the dia gnosis of patients with Baxter\u2019s neuropathy and in \nthe exclusion of other causes of foot pain [23] . However, fatty atrophy of the abductor digiti minimi muscle is not \na specific sign of Baxter\u2019s neuropathy and can be found in 4% of asymptomatic subjects [80].

The evidence is inconclusive  as to whether  MRI or US should be considered  the \npreferred  method for evaluation  of RA [18]. \nUS has been  used to evaluate for osseous abnormalities  in the setting  of chronic  inflammatory  arthritis. Compared  \nwith radiography,  US has been  shown  to demonstrate a 6.5-fold  increase in the number  of detected  erosions of the \nmetacarpophalangeal  joints  [12], but it is less accurate when  compared  with CT [11]. The f alse-positive  rate for US \nin detection  of metacarpophalangeal  joint erosions  has been  reported  as high as 29% [29]. Regardless,  large  erosions  \nidentified  with US at the second  and third  metacarpophalangeal  joints, the distal  ulna,  and the fifth \nmetatarsophalangeal  joint are highly specific for and predictive  of RA [30].

Studies  have  also found US to \nbe helpful  in differentiating  RA and psoriatic  arthritis  [32,33] ; for example,  enthesitis  is a finding often  seen in \nspondyloarthritis  but not seen in RA. Increased  distance between  the nail and distal  phalanx in patients  with psoriatic  \narthritis  and cutaneous  psoriasis is reported  to have  an 80% sensitivity  and a 71% specificity  [34]. \nUS is also useful  in the evaluation  for synovitis  and tenosynovitis,  aided  by the detection  of hyperemia via color  or \nDoppler  signal  [23]. Power  Doppler  US is more  accurate for the diagnosis  of synovitis  and has a higher  correlation  \nwith disease activity  compared  with grayscale US [35,36] . Synovitis  on power  Doppler  US and grayscale US are \nboth associated  with the development  of radiographic  erosions  in patients  with RA compared  with grayscale US \n[37,38] .

Kransdorf, MD.n \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nIn patients with chronic wrist pain, imaging studies are  an important adjunct to history, physical examination, \nlaboratory testing, and electrophysiology studies. The choice of imaging modality depends on the patient\u2019s \npresentation and the clinical questions being asked. There are scenarios in which no imaging beyond baseline \nradiographs is necessary, but in other situations advanced imaging has added value for diagnostic eva luation and \ntreatment planning.  \nOverview of Imaging Modalities  \nRadiographs  \nImaging evaluation of the painful wrist should begin with radiog raphs [1,2]. This simple study may establish a \nspecific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, \nimpaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -\nanterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or \nmore oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling \n[3]. A v ariety of stress positions and maneuvers can be performed to elicit dynamic instability that is not visible \non standard radiographs [ 4]. Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. \nAdditionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ]. \nIn the past , fluoroscopic observation was used to establish the diagnosis of dynamic wrist inst ability. However, in \nmost practices,  fluoroscopy is used either for g uidance during wrist injections  or as an adjunct to arthrography.  \nPercutaneous aspiration of the wrist \u2014which is indicated in cases of suspected septic arthritis or to assess for intra-\narticular crystals\u2014can be carried out with either fluoroscopic or ultrasound (US) guidance  if needed . \nScintigraphy  \nBone scintigraphy has been used for diagnosing occult wrist fractures and as a screening procedure in patients \nwith wrist pain and negative radi ographs. However, while it is sensitive to bone abnormalities, scintigraphy \nsuffers from a lack of specificity [6 ]. Furthermore, bone scans cannot detect soft -tissue abnormalities  such as  \nlesions of the ligaments, tendons, and cartilage, all of which are often responsible for chronic wrist pain.  \nArthrography  \nConventional (x-ray) arthrography can be performed with contrast injection into the radiocarpal joint al one or into \nthe radiocarpal, mi dcarpal, and distal radioulnar joints ( 3-phase technique) for the diagnosis of triangular \nfibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tear and intrinsic ligament perforations. A recent meta -analysis found only \nmoderate pooled sensitivity (76%) for the detection of full -thickness TFCC tears (82% for 3 -phase technique and \n72% for single -injection arthrograms)  [7]. However, arthrography is unable to reliably show the size, shape, and \nstability of TFCC defects and is insensitive to partial-thickness tears. Similarly, while conventional arthrography can be used to diagnose full -thickness defects in the intrinsic intercarpal ligaments, it is unable to identify which \ncomponents of those ligaments are affected, to distinguish degenerative from traumatic lesions, to find partial-\nthickness ligament tears, to demonstrate abnormalities of the extrinsic ligaments, or to show extra-articular \n \naPrincipal Author,  Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri.", "ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 6 Chronic  Extremity  Joint  Pain outcomes , the 2013 European  League Against  Rheumatism  (EULAR)  guidelines  on imaging  of the joints  in RA \nrecommends radiographs  of the hand and feet as the initial imaging  technique  [13]. Assessment  for synovitis  and \ntenosynovitis  is limited  on radiography,  although soft tissue swelling  can be seen in the affected  regions.  Soft tissue  \nand intraarticular  crystal  deposition  as seen with gout or CPP deposition ( CPPD ); however,  are readily  apparent  on \nradiographs  in the form  of tophi  and chondrocalcinosis , respectively.  \nUS Area  of Interest  \nThere is no relevant  literature  supporting the use of ultrasound (US) area of interest  as the initial imaging  modality  \nin this clinical  scenario.  \nVariant  2: Chronic  extremity  joint  pain.

Thus , a uniform  approach  in the imaging  workup of these entities  is reasonable.  \nFeatures of osseous erosions  and soft tissue findings  of synovitis  and tenosynovitis  may be seen in both seropositive  \nand seronegative inflammatory  arthritis, whereas enthesitis  and dactylitis  are typically  seen only with the \nspondyloarthritis . \nThe area of interest for this variant include: the ankle, elbow, foot, hand, hip, knee, shoulder, and wrist.  \nBone  Scan  Whole  Body  \nTc-99m  scintigraphy  has been  shown  to be sensitive but not specific in the diagnosis  of inflammatory  arthritis, but \nit can detect  inflammation  and predict  cortical  erosions  [9,14] . There  is insufficient evidence to support  routine  use \nof bone  scans for evaluation  of seropositive or seronegative inflammatory  arthritis  in the extremities  following  \ninitial radiographs.  \nBone  Scan  Whole  Body  with  SPECT  or SPECT/CT  Area of Interest  \nWhen  adding  single -photon emission  CT (SPECT), RA could be differentiated  from  osteoarthritis  given the added  \ninformation  from  tomographic  images [14].

Although CT \ncan show  bony erosions  and productive  changes with high diagnostic  confidence , the ability  of CT to identify  and \ncharacterize associated  inflammatory  soft tissue findings  and bone  marrow  edema is limited. Newer  techniques  of \niodine -dual -energy CT (DECT ) mapping and high-resolution  peripheral  quantitative  CT have  shown  promise  in \ndetection  and quantification  of periarticular/tenosynovial  inflammation  and bony  changes  respectively  [15].

Overall \nsensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs \nin the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral \nand oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar \ncoalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs \non the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have \nbeen found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable \nmethods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  \nRadiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review \nby Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for \nradiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.  \nRadiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  \nusually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, \nosteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite \nversus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess \nwith radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton\u2019s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other \ncauses of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg\u2019s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals \nor soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . \nThough radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in \npatients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The \ncombination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a \nspecificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15]. \nUS Foot  \nUltrasound (US) is usually not indicate d as the first imaging  study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain, but may \nbe performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of pathologic conditions of the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, \nand other conditions such as tarsal tunnel syndrome, Morton\u2019s  neuroma , plantar plate tears,  and intermetatarsal \nbursitis. \nVariant 2: Persistent posttraumatic foot pain. Radiographs negative or equivocal. Clinical concern includes \ncomplex regional pain syndrome type I.

It has been \nshown that MRI has a significant effect in the diagnostic and therapeutic decisions made by orthopedic surgeons \nthanks to an increase in their confidence levels and change in treatment [34] . MRI is believed to be a sensitive and \nreliable method to evaluate patients with metatarsalgia and Morton\u2019s  neuroma  with a sensitivity of 87%, specificity \nof 100%, accuracy of 89%, PPV of 100% , and NPV of 60% in surgically treated patients [35] . In a meta- analysis,  \nMRI had  a pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio , and negative likelihood ratio of 93%, 68%, 1.89,  \nand 0.19, respectively [36]. Increased fluid within the intermetatarsal bursa, which suggest s bursitis, is well \ndemonstrated on MRI [37] . Although the use of gadolinium does not seem essential to detect Morton\u2019s  neuroma s \n[38], it may facilitate its detection  because of  the improved soft -tissue contrast [32,39] . \nMRI is widely accepted as the imaging study  of choice for diagnosis of plantar plate tears. In a prospective study, \nSung et al [40] found high accuracy (96%), sensitivity (95%), specificity (100%), PPV (100%), and NPV (67%) for \nMRI with surgical correlation. In this study,  moderate concordance was found between tear severity on MR I and \nsurgery with greater concordance at higher severity. A meta-analysis showed higher diagnostic accuracy for MRI \nthan US for the detection of plantar plate tears with sensitivity and specificity for MRI of 95% and 54%, respectively \n[41]. MR arthrography improves visualization of pericapsular structures when compared to conventional MRI and \ntherefore is useful in the diagnosis and characterization of planta r plate tears and abnormalities of related structures \n[42,43] . \nMRI may be helpful to diagnose Freiberg\u2019s infraction and several nonspecific findings have been described in early \nand chronic stages [32,44] . There is no evidence in the literature suppor ting the routine use of contrast in the setting \nof avascular necrosis [45]. \nUS Foot  \nThere is limited information available in the literature regarding the use of US in the diagnosis of sesamoiditis. US \nhas been shown to be useful  in diagnosing tears of the sesamoid phalangeal ligament in the setting of t urf toe [46] . \nMorton\u2019s  neuroma  and fluid-filled intermetatarsal bursae can be demonstrated on US. High -resolution US can \napproach the sensitivity of MRI in detecting Morton\u2019s  neuroma s. Similar to MRI, US is considered a reliable method \nto evaluate patients with Morton\u2019s  neuroma . US has the advantage of allowing clinical correlation during \nexamination. High sensitivities for US and MRI (83% \u201396% and 82% \u201396%, respectively) with no significant \ndifferences between the two modalities were found in a meta- analysis [36]. Other authors have found higher \ndiagnostic capabilities of US over MRI in the diagnosis of Morton\u2019s  neuroma  with pooled sensitivity, specificity, \npositive likeli hood ratio,  and negative likelihood ratio of 90%, 88%, 2.77,  and 0.16 for US and 93%, 68%, 1.89,  \nand 0.19 for MRI [47] . \nMRI is generally better , but US is also useful in the diagnosis of plantar plate tears. In a cadaveric study, an accuracy, \nsensitivity , and specificity of 79%, 78% , and 80% , respectively , were found for US [48]. With MRI as the reference \nstandard, Gregg et al [49]  showed a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV , and accuracy of 91%, 44%, 93%, 35% , and \n85%, respectively , for US in the detection of metatarsophalangeal plantar plate tears in symptomatic subjects.", "CT is also useful to \nevaluate nonunion of sesamoid fractures in symptomatic patients with persistent bone marrow edema on MRI. \nAbnormalitie s in sesamoid position, which may be present in turf toe, hallux valgus, or osteoarthritis can also be \nassessed with CT [29] . CT is considered a useful and reliable method to determine the extent of necrosis in \nFreiberg\u2019s infraction, which represents the main determining factor in the outcome [30]. There is no evidence in the \nliterature supporting the routine use of contrast -enhanced CT imaging in the diagnosis of any of the conditions \ndiscussed above. Given the use of conventional arthrography in the detection of plantar plate tears, CT arthrography \ncould presumably be of use in this setting [31] . \nMRI Foot  \nMRI is useful in the diagnosis of several conditions affecting the hallucal sesamoid bones,  including fractures, acu te \nand chronic stress related changes, and avascular necrosis, and a variety of MRI findings have been described in \nthe literature [12]. Contrast administration is not routinely performed in the assessment of noninfectious and/or", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 8 Chronic Foot Pain  MRI Foot  \nMRI allows the visualization of bone marrow edema patterns, which improve s the detection of fractures in cases of \nnegative or inconclusive radiographs [70] . The utility of MRI in the detection of radiographically occult Chopart \nfractures has been demonstrated by Almeida et al [64] . Baker et al [71]  analyzed 31 occult fractures involving the \nankle and foot in h ockey players,  finding five occult fractures in the foot, all of which involved the navicular bone. \nPierre -Jerome et al [72] found 79% of cuboid fractures in the diabetic population that were radiographically occult \nusing MRI. MRI is also useful in the detection of occult fractures involving the fifth metatarsal bone (Jones fracture) \nand the subtalar join t [65,73] . There is no evidence in the literature supporting the routine use of contrast in the \ndiagnosi s of occult fractures.  \nMRI has replaced bone scans in the evaluation of symptomatic accessory ossicles. MRI allows optimal visualization \nof the bone marrow within the ossicle and visualization of the synchondrosis. Accessory ossicles may also be \nassociated  with tendon pathology, which is also well assessed on MRI [74]. MRI allows clear demonstration of the \nfindings often associated with posterior ankle impingement syndrome [75]. Contrast administration is not routinely \nperformed when assessing symptomatic accessory ossicles on MRI; however, contrast within a disrupted \nsynchondrosis may be demonstrated on MR arthrography stu dies [69]. \nUS Foot   \nAlthough not routinely performed, previous studies have demonstrated the role of US in the detection of occult foot \nfractures. On US, these can be seen as cortical irregularities and are frequently associated with soft -tissue injury in \nthe acute or subacute setting. Wang et al [76]  demonstrated 24 cases of radiographically occult ankle and foot \nfractures in 268 patients. Of these, foot fractures were found most frequently in the calcaneus and metatarsals, and \nless frequently in the navicular, cuboid , and cuneiform bones.  \nOn US, several findings have been reported in cases of painful accessory ossicles, including patients with posterior \nankle impingement syndrome ; however , optimal characterization of the synchondrosis is difficult on US [62] . High -\nresolution US offers some advantages over other imagin g modalities because it allows dynamic exploration of the \nfoot with further assessment of stability of the synchondrosis and tendon tears when present as well as direct clinical \ncorrelation and comparative evaluation with the asymptomatic foot [77] . Power Doppler US has proven useful in \nidentifying increased blood supply in the setting of ankle impingement [78,79] . \nVariant 6: Chronic foot pain. Entrapment s yndromes.

Because of  its ability to demonstrate signal intensity changes in the presence of \nmuscle denervation, MRI has been sho wn to be useful in the dia gnosis of patients with Baxter\u2019s neuropathy and in \nthe exclusion of other causes of foot pain [23] . However, fatty atrophy of the abductor digiti minimi muscle is not \na specific sign of Baxter\u2019s neuropathy and can be found in 4% of asymptomatic subjects [80]. Contrast \nadministration is not routinely performed in the initial assessment of neuropathic syndromes.  \nUS Foot  \nCompression of the infe rior calcaneal nerve or Baxter\u2019s neuropathy due to calcaneal enthesophytes, plantar fasciitis,  \nor varices can result in heel pain.", "A \nmeta -analysis showed higher diagnostic accuracy for MRI than US for the detection of plantar plate tears. In this \nmeta -analysis the sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio , and negative likelihood ratio were 93%, 33%, \n1.2, and 0.35 , respectively , for US  [41]. \nVariant 4: Chronic plantar heel pain. Radiographs negative or equivocal. Clinical concern includes plantar \nfasciitis or plantar fascia tear. Next imaging study.  \nBone Scan Foot with SPECT or SPECT/CT  \nSPECT/CT has been found to be of use when investigating heel pain with increased specificity when compared to \nbone scintigraphy alone , because of  the improved anatomic localization of metabolic activity. Despite the anatomic \nand functional advantages of SPECT/CT, MRI and high-frequency US remain the most frequently used imaging  \nmodalities in patients with heel pain [50]. A characteristic p attern of abnormal uptake on 3-phase bone scintigraphy \nhas been proven helpful to differentiate plantar fasciitis from calcaneal stress or avulsion fractures [51]. There is no \nrelevant literature  to support the routine use of nuclear medicine studies to diagnose plantar fascia l tears.", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 7 Chronic Foot Pain  CT Foot  \nThere is no relevant literature  to support the routine use of CT in the evaluation of a patient with clinical suspicion \nof pathology of the plantar fascia.  \nMRI Foot  \nMRI allows accurate characterization of the pl antar fascia and adjacent soft -tissues and bones, and several imaging \nfindin gs have been described in patients with plantar fasciitis and partial or complete tears of the plantar fascia on \nMRI [52]. Given that, some of the find ings in patients with plantar fasciitis are nonspecific; these findings can also \nbe seen in asymptomatic patients.  MRI should always be correlated with clinical symptoms to avoid overcalling \nplantar fasciitis. Although no significant differences have been found in plantar fascia thickness on US and MRI, \nMRI is currently considered the most sensitive imaging study  in the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis [53]. There is no \nrelevant literature supporting the routine use of contrast in the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis or tears.  \nUS Foot  \nUS has shown good sensitivity (80%) and specificity (88%) in the dia gnosis of plantar fasciitis when compared to \nMRI [54].

Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a \nsignificant improvement in health-related quality of life with effective treatment of foot pain [3] . Estimating the \nprevalence of chron ic foot pain is challenging, because there is no consensus regarding the definition of chronic \npain in the literature. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines chronic pain as any pain persisting \npast the normal healing time, suggesting 3 months in case of chronic pain of benign causes.  \nWomen are more commonly affected , and forefoot conditions are more frequent. Persistent pain for more than 6  \nyears has been reported in 51% of women between 70 to 75 years of age [4]. Because of  the wide range of causes \nof chronic foot pain, assessment of these patients with imaging studies in addition to a dedicated clinical \nexamination is often needed [1] . \nThe guidelines of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons divide heel pain into plantar heel pain,  usually \nrelated to pathology of the plantar fascia, and posterior heel pain,  usually related to pathology of  the Achilles tendon, \nand treatment options vary from nonoperative treatments to surgical procedures [5] . \nChronic foot pain in children, symptoms related to soft -tissue or bone neoplasms and pain related to infectious \nconditions, inflammatory arthropathies, or other systemic diseases are beyond the scope of this document. \nEvaluation of patients with neuropathic foot or Charcot arthropathy is addressed in the ACR Appropriateness \nCriteria\u00ae topic on \u201c Suspected Osteomyelitis of the Foot in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus \u201d [6].

Overall \nsensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs \nin the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral \nand oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar \ncoalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs \non the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have \nbeen found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable \nmethods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  \nRadiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review \nby Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for \nradiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.  \nRadiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  \nusually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, \nosteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite \nversus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess \nwith radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton\u2019s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other \ncauses of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg\u2019s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals \nor soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . \nThough radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in \npatients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The \ncombination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a \nspecificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15]. \nUS Foot  \nUltrasound (US) is usually not indicate d as the first imaging  study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain, but may \nbe performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of pathologic conditions of the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, \nand other conditions such as tarsal tunnel syndrome, Morton\u2019s  neuroma , plantar plate tears,  and intermetatarsal \nbursitis. \nVariant 2: Persistent posttraumatic foot pain.

Although the use of gadolinium does not seem essential to detect Morton\u2019s  neuroma s \n[38], it may facilitate its detection  because of  the improved soft -tissue contrast [32,39] . \nMRI is widely accepted as the imaging study  of choice for diagnosis of plantar plate tears.

Kransdorf, MD.n \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nIn patients with chronic wrist pain, imaging studies are  an important adjunct to history, physical examination, \nlaboratory testing, and electrophysiology studies. The choice of imaging modality depends on the patient\u2019s \npresentation and the clinical questions being asked. There are scenarios in which no imaging beyond baseline \nradiographs is necessary, but in other situations advanced imaging has added value for diagnostic eva luation and \ntreatment planning.  \nOverview of Imaging Modalities  \nRadiographs  \nImaging evaluation of the painful wrist should begin with radiog raphs [1,2]. This simple study may establish a \nspecific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, \nimpaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -\nanterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or \nmore oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling \n[3]. A v ariety of stress positions and maneuvers can be performed to elicit dynamic instability that is not visible \non standard radiographs [ 4]. Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. \nAdditionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ]. \nIn the past , fluoroscopic observation was used to establish the diagnosis of dynamic wrist inst ability. However, in \nmost practices,  fluoroscopy is used either for g uidance during wrist injections  or as an adjunct to arthrography.  \nPercutaneous aspiration of the wrist \u2014which is indicated in cases of suspected septic arthritis or to assess for intra-\narticular crystals\u2014can be carried out with either fluoroscopic or ultrasound (US) guidance  if needed . \nScintigraphy  \nBone scintigraphy has been used for diagnosing occult wrist fractures and as a screening procedure in patients \nwith wrist pain and negative radi ographs. However, while it is sensitive to bone abnormalities, scintigraphy \nsuffers from a lack of specificity [6 ]. Furthermore, bone scans cannot detect soft -tissue abnormalities  such as  \nlesions of the ligaments, tendons, and cartilage, all of which are often responsible for chronic wrist pain.  \nArthrography  \nConventional (x-ray) arthrography can be performed with contrast injection into the radiocarpal joint al one or into \nthe radiocarpal, mi dcarpal, and distal radioulnar joints ( 3-phase technique) for the diagnosis of triangular \nfibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tear and intrinsic ligament perforations. A recent meta -analysis found only \nmoderate pooled sensitivity (76%) for the detection of full -thickness TFCC tears (82% for 3 -phase technique and \n72% for single -injection arthrograms)  [7]. However, arthrography is unable to reliably show the size, shape, and \nstability of TFCC defects and is insensitive to partial-thickness tears. Similarly, while conventional arthrography can be used to diagnose full -thickness defects in the intrinsic intercarpal ligaments, it is unable to identify which \ncomponents of those ligaments are affected, to distinguish degenerative from traumatic lesions, to find partial-\nthickness ligament tears, to demonstrate abnormalities of the extrinsic ligaments, or to show extra-articular \n \naPrincipal Author,  Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri.", "In other patients, nonspecific radiologic findings (including those in the soft  tissues) combined with the history and physical examination may be \nsufficient for clinical diagnosis, or may suggest preferred secondary imaging studies.  \nMRI  \nMRI is no t routinely used in the initial evaluation of chronic wrist pain.", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 12 Chronic Wrist Pain  CT Wrist  \nCT, with or without IV  contrast, is not routinely used to further e valuate ulnar -sided chronic wrist pain when \nradiographs are normal or nonspecific.  \nBone Scan  Wrist  \nBone scan is not routinely used to further evaluate ulnar -sided chronic wrist pain when radiographs are normal or \nnonspecific . \nVariant 6: Radial -sided chroni c wrist pain.  Radiographs normal or nonspecific . Next study.   \nMRI Wrist  \nMRI is accurate for diagnosing scapholunate ligament tears [8,10,38,39], and noncontrast -enhanced MRI is \nusually appropriate in this scenario . IV contrast seldom provides added benefit in patients w ith radial -sided wrist \npain but may increase sensitivity for ligament lesions if MR arthrography is desired but direct joint injection is not \nfeasible.  \nMR Arthrography  Wrist  \nDirect MR arthrography (with contrast injection either into the radiocarpal joint or into all three  compartments of \nthe wrist) may be appropriate in this scenario; the examination has higher sensitivity than noncontrast -enhanced \nMRI\u2014even when performed at 3.0 T \u2014for diagnosis of complete and incomplete scapholunate and lunotriquetral \nligament tears [3 ,8,38]. For the scapholunate ligament, direct MR  arthrography also allows more accurate \ndetermination of which specific segments of the ligament are torn compared to conventional MRI [43], which has \nimportant biomechanical implications for wrist stability. Direct MR arthrography also has an advantage over \nnoncontrast -enhanced MRI for diagnosing extrinsic ligament abnormalities [44].  \nCT Arthrography  Wrist  \nThe accuracy of CT arthrography and MR arthrography are similar for lesions of the scapholunate ligament [8 ]. \nCompared to conventional MRI, CT arthrography may be more sensitive for tears of the biomechanically \nimportant dorsal ligament fibers [16]. In contrast to MRI and MR arthrography, CT arthrography is less sensitive \nfor diagnosis of extra -articular findings (like ganglion cysts and tendon disorders) t hat can cause radial -sided pain.  \nCT arthrography may be appropriate in this scenario.  \nCT Wrist  \nCT, with or without IV contrast,  is not routinely used to further evaluate chronic radial -sided wrist pain when \nradiographs are normal or nonspecific.  \nUS Wrist  \nWhile some investigators have tried high-resolution US with or  without arthrography for diagnosing intrinsic \nligament [41,42], its sensitivity in comparison to MRI, MR arthrography, and CT arthrography is unknown. \nAdditionally, imaging with US is largely limited to the dorsal fibers of the ligaments [42]. US may be appropriate \nin cases of suspected de Quervain disease (stenosing tenosynovitis of the abductor pollicis longus and extensor \npollicis brevis tendon compartment), where preoperative identification of a septum or subcompartmentalization \nwithin the first dorsal compartment with US may affect surgical management [18,19]. US may be appropriate in \npatients with radial -sided pain in cases where extra-articular pathology is the primary consideration.  \nArthrography  Wrist  \nConventional (x-ray) arthrography has largely been supplanted by CT arthrogra phy and MR arthrography because \nthese cross-sectional studies are better able to predict which fibers of the scapholunate ligament are torn and \nwhether any repairable fibers remain , both of which are important features that affect operative management . \nAdditionally, while fibrocartilage and ligament perforations are moderately associated with ulnar -sided wrist pain, \nthere is a poor correlation between ligament lesions and radial -sided pain [45]. Furthermore, conventional \narthrography is unable to show extra -articular findings (like ganglion cysts and tendon disorders) that can cause \nradial -sided pain, further limiting its usefulness in  this patient population .", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 11 Chronic Wrist Pain  CT Wrist  \nWhile CT with IV contrast enhancement can depict abscesses, it is usually not appropriate  for evaluation of \nsuspected wrist infections.  \nCT Arthrography  Wrist  \nCT arthrography is not routinely used to eval uate suspected wrist infection.  \nUS Wrist  \nThere may be a role for US in the staging of infections (for example, to delineate the location and e xtent of soft -\ntissue abscesses) after aspiration has been performed.  Alternatively, US may be used in conjunction with \naspiration as a method to first identify collections and then as the imaging method to guide aspiration.  \nBone Scan  Wrist  \nBone scan is not  routinely used to eval uate suspected chronic wrist infection.  \nArthrography  Wrist  \nRadiographic arthrography  is not routinely used to eval uate suspected wrist infection.  \nVariant 5:  Ulnar -sided chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or nonspecific . Next study.  \nMRI Wrist  \nBoth traumatic and degenerative lesions of the TFCC can produce chronic, ulnar -sided wrist pain . MRI is highly \naccurate for lesions involving the radial (central) zone of the disc, especially with the use of high -resolution fast \nspin-echo or 3-D grad ient-recalled pulse sequences [36]. There is some evidence suggesting that MRI performed \nwith a 3.0 T system is even more accurate than MRI performed with a 1.5 T system for TFCC lesions [37], but \nthere are no studies comparing the accuracy of the two field s trengths in the same patients. The sensitivity for \ntears of the ulnar attachment of the disc and the peripheral attachments (the ulnocarpal ligaments) are only fair \nwith noncontrast -enhanced wrist MRI [ 12,36]. IV contrast seldom provides added benefit in patients with ulnar -\nsided wrist pain but may increase sensitivity for TFCC lesions if MR arthrography is desired but direct joint \ninjection is not feasible. \nMR Arthrography  Wrist  \nDirect MR arthrography (performed with contrast injection of the radiocarpal or distal radioulnar compartments, \nalone or in combination) does result in better diagnostic accuracy for the T FCC compared with conventional MRI, \nespecially for ulnar -sided lesions [26, 38], even when compared to conventio nal MRI performed with a 3.0 T \nmagnet [7,8,39]. The same is true for intrinsic ligament injuries, such as those of the lunotriquetral ligament, \nwhich can produce ulnar -sided pain [7 ,8,39].

According to the National \nHospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey , 1.5% of all emergency department visits involve  hand and wrist \nfractu res. Distal radius fractures are especially common, accounting for up to 18% of fractures in the elderly [ 2,3]. \nBecause of increasing rates of osteoporosis, the incidence of distal radius fractures has been increasing [ 4]. \nAlthough most distal radius fractures in e lderly patients are managed non operatively, the use of internal fixation is \nincreasing. Internal fixation has a much higher cost than nonopera tive treatment as well as increased rates of \nhospitalization [5]. \nFor most patients with trauma to the hand and wrist, conventional radiographs provide sufficient diagnostic \ninformation to guide the treating physician.  However, delayed diagnosis is common because distal radius and \nscaphoid fractures may be radiographically occult  [6]. When initial radiographs  are normal but there is high \nclinical suspicion for fracture, further imaging with additional radiographic pr ojections, CT, or MRI  is \nappropriate . If associated soft -tissue injury is clinically suspected, CT, CT arthrography, MR I, MR arthrography, \nor ultrasound (US) may be indicated  [7-10]. \nSuccessful treatment of distal radius fractures requires restoration of radial length, inclination, and tilt, as well as \nthe realignment of the articular fracture fragments [9,11]. The presence of a coronally  oriented fracture line, die -\npunch depression, or more than three articular fracture fragments are common indications for operative reduction \n[8]. Operative fixation resulting in < 2 mm of residual articular surface step-off is usually considered necessary to \navoid long-term complications , such as osteoarthritis [9 ,12]. \nDiscussion of Procedures by Variant  \nVariant 1: Acute blunt or penetrating trauma to the hand or wrist. Initial imaging.  \nRadiograph y Area of Interest  \nRadiography is  always indicated as the initial imaging for suspected acute hand and wrist trauma.  For m ost joints \nof the extremities, especially those involving the wrist, hand, and fingers, a radiographic examination that \nincludes only 2 views is not adequate for detecting fractures [13]. For patients with suspected  distal radius \nfractures, a 3-view examination  of the wrist  usually includes a posteroanterior (PA) , a lateral, and a 45\u00b0 \nsemi pronated oblique view  [11]. One study [ 14] reports that a fourth projection\u2014a semisupinated oblique \u2014\nincreases diagnostic yield for distal radius fractures.  \nA standard 3 -view radiographic examination of the hand shows most fractures and dislocations of the metacarpals \nand phalanges [ 13]. For phalangeal injuries, some centers include a PA examination of the entire hand, whereas \nothers limit the examination to the injured finger.  An internally rotated oblique project ion, in addition to the \nstandard externally rotated oblique, increases diagnostic yield for phalangeal fractures [15]. \n                                                 \naResearch Author, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston Salem, North Carolina. bWake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston \nSalem, North Carolina."], ["ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 16 Chronic Wrist Pain  Arthrography  Wrist  \nOnce a scaphoid fracture is identified, Radiographic arthrography does not contribute to the evaluation for \ncomplications of the fracture.  \nVariant 12: Chronic wrist pain.

MRI is useful for diagnosing infectious and noninfectious tenosynovitis in \nboth the flexor and extensor wrist compartments [46]. Occult ganglion cysts are also easily identified with MRI, \nbut some authors recommend use of IV contrast to distinguish ganglia from synovitis [ 47]. For noncystic soft-\ntissue masses, MRI may demonstrate findings that are diagnostic for certain benign conditions (eg, lipomas, \nhemangiomas, benign nerve sheath tumors), and can stage the extent of involvement for nonspecific masses ( see \nthe ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae topic on \u201c Soft-Tissue Masses \u201d [48]). \nUS Wrist  \nWrist US or MRI (without or without  and with IV contrast) are alternative initial examinations that are usually \nappropriate in this setting.

In patients with persistent symptoms thought to be due to an occult wrist \nfracture, MRI can be used as an alternative to presumptive casting and repeat radiographs [ 12].

The choice of imaging modality depends on the patient\u2019s \npresentation and the clinical questions being asked. There are scenarios in which no imaging beyond baseline \nradiographs is necessary, but in other situations advanced imaging has added value for diagnostic eva luation and \ntreatment planning.  \nOverview of Imaging Modalities  \nRadiographs  \nImaging evaluation of the painful wrist should begin with radiog raphs [1,2]. This simple study may establish a \nspecific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, \nimpaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -\nanterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or \nmore oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling \n[3]. A v ariety of stress positions and maneuvers can be performed to elicit dynamic instability that is not visible \non standard radiographs [ 4]. Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. \nAdditionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ]. \nIn the past , fluoroscopic observation was used to establish the diagnosis of dynamic wrist inst ability. However, in \nmost practices,  fluoroscopy is used either for g uidance during wrist injections  or as an adjunct to arthrography.  \nPercutaneous aspiration of the wrist \u2014which is indicated in cases of suspected septic arthritis or to assess for intra-\narticular crystals\u2014can be carried out with either fluoroscopic or ultrasound (US) guidance  if needed . \nScintigraphy  \nBone scintigraphy has been used for diagnosing occult wrist fractures and as a screening procedure in patients \nwith wrist pain and negative radi ographs. However, while it is sensitive to bone abnormalities, scintigraphy \nsuffers from a lack of specificity [6 ]. Furthermore, bone scans cannot detect soft -tissue abnormalities  such as  \nlesions of the ligaments, tendons, and cartilage, all of which are often responsible for chronic wrist pain.  \nArthrography  \nConventional (x-ray) arthrography can be performed with contrast injection into the radiocarpal joint al one or into \nthe radiocarpal, mi dcarpal, and distal radioulnar joints ( 3-phase technique) for the diagnosis of triangular \nfibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tear and intrinsic ligament perforations. A recent meta -analysis found only \nmoderate pooled sensitivity (76%) for the detection of full -thickness TFCC tears (82% for 3 -phase technique and \n72% for single -injection arthrograms)  [7]. However, arthrography is unable to reliably show the size, shape, and \nstability of TFCC defects and is insensitive to partial-thickness tears. Similarly, while conventional arthrography can be used to diagnose full -thickness defects in the intrinsic intercarpal ligaments, it is unable to identify which \ncomponents of those ligaments are affected, to distinguish degenerative from traumatic lesions, to find partial-\nthickness ligament tears, to demonstrate abnormalities of the extrinsic ligaments, or to show extra-articular \n \naPrincipal Author,  Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri.", "Bone Scan  Wrist  \nBone scan is not routinely used to further evaluate radial -sided chronic wrist pain when radiographs are normal or \nnonspecific.", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 8 Chronic Wrist Pain  abnormalities responsible for pain when there is no ligament or TFCC abnormality. Because of these limitations, \narthrography  has now largely been supplanted by cross-sectional imaging. Fluoroscopic -guided intra -articular \ninjections are chiefly used as a first step when performing arthrographic  computed tomography ( CT) and \nmagnetic resonance imaging (MR I) studies [8]. \nMRI  \nWrist MRI accurately depicts abnormalities of the bones and bone marrow, articular cartilage, intrinsic and \nextrinsic ligaments, TFCC, synovium, tendons, and neurovascular structures, making it a powerful study for \nchronic pai n caused by diverse etiologies.  \nA dedicated receiver coil or transmit -receive coil is necessary to provide the signal -to-noise ratio needed for high-\nresolution, high-contrast MRI of the wrist [9 ]. MR arthrography \u2014either with direct contrast injection into one  or \nmore wrist compartments or performed indirectly after intravenous (IV) contrast administration \u2014can enhance the \nyield of the study for diagnosing internal wrist derangements, especially abnormalities of the ligaments, articular cartilage, and TFCC of the wrist. MRI performed with a 3.0 T magnet and a dedicated coil provides better signal -\nto-noise ratio and better contrast compared with wrist MR I performed with 1.5 T  or lower field strength systems \n[10,11]. \nCT \nCT of the wr ist is used primarily when high-det ail imaging of bone cortex or trabeculae is needed. In patients with \nchronic wrist pain and prior fractures, CT is typically the study of choice to evaluate fracture healing and joint \ncongruence. When a radiographically occult fracture is suspected as the cause of a patient\u2019s chronic pain, either \nCT or MRI can be used [12]. Advantages of CT over MRI for the wrist include  its ability to obtain high -resolution \nimages of both wrists simultaneously and the much shorter acquisition times for CT. These factors make CT the \npreferred examination for suspected distal radioulnar joint subluxation, where images of both wrists can be  \nobtained in both supination and pronation [1 ,13]. A disadvantage of CT  is its lower sensitivity to soft -tissue \nabnormalities  compared with MRI.  \nHigh-resolution (typically multidetector) CT of the wrist following contrast injection into one or more wrist \ncompartments (CT arthrography) is a powerful tool for diagnosing intra -articular abnormalities [14,15]. The \nintraobserver agreement on CT arthrogram images is extremely high and better than that reported for MRI \n[14,16]. \nUS \nUS of the wrist is useful for examining extra -articular soft tissues, such as suspected ganglion cyst s [17], because \nits accuracy is similar to that of MRI. US can also be used to diagnose abnormalities of the flexor and extensor \ntendons and tendon sheaths. For de Quervain disease (stenosing tenosynovitis of the abductor pollicis lon gus and \nextensor pollicis brevis tendon compartment), preoperative identification of a septum or subcompartmentalization \nwithin the first dorsal compartment with US  may affect surgical management [18 ,19]. \nIn patients with suspected or established rheumatoid arthritis (RA), US examination of the wrist and selected \nfinger joints can identify erosions and active synovit is (with the use of power Doppler), findings that influence \nearly diagnosis and treatment decisions [20]. Using US to measure the size of the median nerve is a  validated  \ntechnique in patients with clinical symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome [21-24].  \nIn addition, w rist US is a useful technique to guide therapeutic intr a-articular and other soft -tissue injections [25].  \nDiscussion of Procedures by Variant  \nVariant 1: Chronic wrist pain.

However, arthrography is unable to reliably show the size, shape, and \nstability of TFCC defects and is insensitive to partial-thickness tears. Similarly, while conventional arthrography can be used to diagnose full -thickness defects in the intrinsic intercarpal ligaments, it is unable to identify which \ncomponents of those ligaments are affected, to distinguish degenerative from traumatic lesions, to find partial-\nthickness ligament tears, to demonstrate abnormalities of the extrinsic ligaments, or to show extra-articular \n \naPrincipal Author,  Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri.", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 11 Chronic Wrist Pain  CT Wrist  \nWhile CT with IV contrast enhancement can depict abscesses, it is usually not appropriate  for evaluation of \nsuspected wrist infections.  \nCT Arthrography  Wrist  \nCT arthrography is not routinely used to eval uate suspected wrist infection.  \nUS Wrist  \nThere may be a role for US in the staging of infections (for example, to delineate the location and e xtent of soft -\ntissue abscesses) after aspiration has been performed.

Radiographs normal or nonspecific . Next study.  \nMRI Wrist  \nBoth traumatic and degenerative lesions of the TFCC can produce chronic, ulnar -sided wrist pain . MRI is highly \naccurate for lesions involving the radial (central) zone of the disc, especially with the use of high -resolution fast \nspin-echo or 3-D grad ient-recalled pulse sequences [36]. There is some evidence suggesting that MRI performed \nwith a 3.0 T system is even more accurate than MRI performed with a 1.5 T system for TFCC lesions [37], but \nthere are no studies comparing the accuracy of the two field s trengths in the same patients. The sensitivity for \ntears of the ulnar attachment of the disc and the peripheral attachments (the ulnocarpal ligaments) are only fair \nwith noncontrast -enhanced wrist MRI [ 12,36]. IV contrast seldom provides added benefit in patients with ulnar -\nsided wrist pain but may increase sensitivity for TFCC lesions if MR arthrography is desired but direct joint \ninjection is not feasible. \nMR Arthrography  Wrist  \nDirect MR arthrography (performed with contrast injection of the radiocarpal or distal radioulnar compartments, \nalone or in combination) does result in better diagnostic accuracy for the T FCC compared with conventional MRI, \nespecially for ulnar -sided lesions [26, 38], even when compared to conventio nal MRI performed with a 3.0 T \nmagnet [7,8,39]. The same is true for intrinsic ligament injuries, such as those of the lunotriquetral ligament, \nwhich can produce ulnar -sided pain [7 ,8,39]. Performing either MR arthrography or noncontrast -enhanced MRI is \nusually appropriate in this scenario.  \nCT Arthrography  Wrist  \nThe accuracy of CT arthrography is superior to MRI  and similar to that  of MR arthrography for TFCC and \nintrinsic ligament lesions [8,40]. In addition, CT arthrography appears to be mor e accurate than either MRI or  MR \narthrography for identifying articular cartilage defects in the wrist [38]. In contrast to MRI and MR arthrography, \nCT arthrography is less sensitive to lesions occurring outside of the joint (like abnormalities of the extensor carpi \nulnaris tendon) that can result in ulnar -sided pain.  For these reasons, CT arthrography may be appropriate in this \nsetting , especially if there is a contraindication to MRI or if artifact from metallic implants produce too much \nartifact on MRI.  \nArthrography  Wrist  \nConventional (x-ray) arthrography\u2014performed with contrast injection into one  or more  wrist compartments\u2014has \nmoderate accuracy for the diagnosis of TFCC perforations [7 ].", "Bone Scan  Wrist  \nBone scan is not routinely used to further evaluate radial -sided chronic wrist pain when radiographs are normal or \nnonspecific.", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 13 Chronic Wrist Pain  Variant 7: Chronic wrist pain.

Fluid -filled and synovial -lined structures (includin g ganglia, cysts, bursa, and tendon", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 14 Chronic Wrist Pain  sheaths) are well depicted with MRI. MRI is useful for diagnosing infectious and noninfectious tenosynovitis in \nboth the flexor and extensor wrist compartments [46]. Occult ganglion cysts are also easily identified with MRI, \nbut some authors recommend use of IV contrast to distinguish ganglia from synovitis [ 47]. For noncystic soft-\ntissue masses, MRI may demonstrate findings that are diagnostic for certain benign conditions (eg, lipomas, \nhemangiomas, benign nerve sheath tumors), and can stage the extent of involvement for nonspecific masses ( see \nthe ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae topic on \u201c Soft-Tissue Masses \u201d [48]). \nUS Wrist  \nWrist US or MRI (without or without  and with IV contrast) are alternative initial examinations that are usually \nappropriate in this setting.

In patients with persistent symptoms thought to be due to an occult wrist \nfracture, MRI can be used as an alternative to presumptive casting and repeat radiographs [ 12]. MRI is also \nsensitive to stress fractures and stress injuries of the physes, for example, in gymnasts [50].  IV contrast does not \nadd to the examination and is usually not appropriate.  \nCT Wrist  \nEither CT without IV contrast or MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate in this scenario. CT can provide high-detail imaging of bone cortex a nd trabeculae and thus can be used to identify radiographically occult  \nfractures and stress fractures.

Radiographs normal or nonspecific. Suspect carpal tunnel syndrome.  Next \nstudy. \nUS Wrist \nSeveral meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the \ncarpal  tunnel  inlet) is highly accurate for identifying carpal  tunnel syndrome  diagnosed clinically or with the \ncombination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US \nvaries depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the \nmeasurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary \nexamination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel \nsyndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal \ntunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, \nclinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of \ncarpal tunnel syndrome. US may be appropriate in cases where this initial evaluation is equivocal.  \nMRI Wrist  \nHistorically, carpal tunnel syndrome has been diagnosed based on clinical signs and sympt oms and confirmed by \nthe results of electrodiagnostic studies [67]. MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in cases in which this  \ninitial evaluation is equivocal. The MRI findings that have been reported in wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome \u2014\nincluding nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing\u2014may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value \nin patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68]. In rare cases of secondary carpal tunnel syndrome, MRI may identify \na mass lesion compressing the median nerve. There is some evidence that the length of T2 hyperintensity in the \nmedian nerve can help prognosticate the success of surgery [69] and that the shape and signal of the nerve predict \nclinical response to a steroid injection in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome [70 ]. MR neurography \nmay be an option in patients with suspected carpal tunnel syndrome.  The use o f IV contrast does not contribute to \ndiagnosis and is usually not appropriate.  \nMR Arthrography  Wrist  \nMR arthrography is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.  \nCT Wrist  \nCT, with or without IV  contrast, is not routinely used to diagnose carpa l tunnel syndrome.  \nCT Arthrography  Wrist  \nCT arthrography is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.  \nBone Scan  Wrist  \nBone scan is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.  \nArthrography  Wrist  \nRadiographic arthrography  is not routinely us ed to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome . \nSummary of Recommendations  \n\u2022 Wrist radiographs are indicated as the best initial imaging examination in patients with chronic wrist pain. \n\u2022 When radiographs are normal or equivocal and a patient has persistent symptoms wi th an unclear diagnosis, \nMRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate.  \n\u2022 In patients with suspected inflammatory arthritis, MRI either with or without IV contrast is usually \nappropriate if guidance for management or prognostication is needed.  \n\u2022 Patients with  suspected wrist infection should undergo aspiration.  \n\u2022 When radiographs are normal or equivocal in a patient with ulnar -sided pain, either MRI without IV contrast \nor an MR arthrogram of the wrist is usually appropriate.  \n\u2022 When radiographs are normal or equivocal in a patient with radial -sided pain, MRI without IV contrast is \nusually appropriate."], ["As such,  noncontrast  MRI should be considered  as the next imaging test following  \nradiographic  evaluation  of the hip joint [25-34].

CT \narthrography has also been  shown  to be more  helpful  in identifying  chondral  lesions [16] when  compared  to MRI.  \nHowever,  arthrography does not offer an advantage  over noncontrast  CT for the detection  of extra-articular  \nimpingement  (eg, ischiopelvic,  ischiotrochanteric,  subspinous,  and femoropelvic).  \nCT Hip With  IV Contrast  \nCT without  IV contrast  is often  used for preoperative  assessment  of bony anatomy  in the setting  of FAI and hip \ndysplasia [42-44].

For evaluating  labral  tears,  MRI  \nwith or without  arthrography can be used [76-79].

Kransdorf, MD.q \nSummary of Literature Review  \nBackground/Introduction \nChronic knee pain affects tens of millions of people  in the United States annually , with the pain sometimes highly \ndisabling and often negatively impacting the patient\u2019s quality of life. Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and \nit can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain \nwith the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. \nTypically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain \npersists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  \nimaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated \nthat approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the \nprior year) radiographs [2 ]. \nThis document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  \u22655 years of age.  The \nvariants discussed include: (1) initial exam ination ; (2) initial radiograph is normal or demonstrates a joint \neffusion; (3) initial radiogr aph demonstrates osteochondritis dissecans (OCD), loose bodies or history of cartilage,  \nor meniscal repair; (4) initial radiograph demonstrates osteoarthritis or chondrocalcinosis; and (5)  initial \nradiograph demonstrates signs of prior (chronic) knee injur y (ie, Segond fract ure, tibial spine avulsion, etc ).  \nTo evaluat e knee pain associated with other conditions, please refer to the following ACR Appropriateness \nCriteria\u00ae topic on:  \u201cOsteonecrosi s of the Hip \u201d [3] for osteonecrosis,  \u201cAcute Trauma to the Knee \u201d for acute knee \ninjuries  [4], \u201cImaging After Total Knee Arthroplasty \u201d for patients with total knee arthroplasty  [5], \u201cSoft-Tissue \nMasses \u201d for a patient with a suspected soft -tissue mass [6], \u201cPrimary Bone Tumors \u201d for a patient with a suspected \nor known bone tumor [ 7], and \u201c Chronic Extremity Joint Pain -Suspected Inflammatory Arthritis \u201d for patient with \nsuspected arthritis  or synovitis [ 8]. \nSpecial Imaging  Considerations  \nKnee radiographs  should include at least one frontal projection of one or both knees (anteroposterior, Rosenberg, \nor tunnel), a tangential patellar view , and a lateral view of the affected knee [2,9]. Standing radiographs more \naccurately reflect medial and lateral compartment cartilage loss than supine radiographs with the posteromedial and posterolateral joint compartments  more accurately assessed using a weight -bearing flexion posteroanterior \nradiograph [9,10]. \nDiscussion of Pro cedures by Variant  \nVariant 1:  Adult or child greater than or equal to 5  year s of age . Chronic knee pain. Initial imaging.  \nRadiography Knee \nRadiographs  should be the initial imaging study for chronic knee pain. In elderly patients, the most common \nsource of  chronic knee pain is osteoarthritis.", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 6 Chronic Knee Pain  of age having an asymptomatic meniscal tear , and the likelihood of a meniscal tear being present in either a \npainful or asymptomatic knee not significantly different in patients 45 to 55 years of age [20,21]. \nBone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the \nsubchondral bone.  New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or \npatients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee \npain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the \norigin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. \nSubchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed \nspontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to \nelderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs \noften initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, \nand progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is \nsuspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria\n\u00ae \ntopic on \u201c Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae \u201d [28]. \nSome patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using \nquantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs \nexhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ]. \nPatellofemoral car tilage loss is also associated with chronic knee pain , with active knee pain correlated with \nBMLs [30,31]. Similar to CT, MRI can calculate various anatomic measurements associated with patellofemoral \nsubluxation/dislocation and lateral patellofemoral friction syndrome [32-34]. Bone marrow edema in the classic \nlocation for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also \ndifferentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise \ntherapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. \nOther etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat \npad impingement syndromes, Hoffa\u2019s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome, adhesive \ncapsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes , \nand osteonecrosis [15, 19,36-45].  \nMRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a \njoint effusion. However, contrast -enhanced images ma y be more accurate in diagnosing other causes of chronic \nknee pain , such as Hoffa\u2019s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome, and adhesive \ncapsulitis [15].  In particular, enh ancing synovitis thicker than 2 mm in Hoffa\u2019s fat is correlated with peripatellar \npain [46]. Contrast -enhanced MRI is also useful in quantifying the degree of synovitis and in evaluating \nconditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis [ 17,42,47,48].  \nMR Arthrography  Knee  \nMR arthrography performed with an intra -articular injection of dilute gadolinium solution is typically not \nindicated as a second exam ination  but rather reserved for patients with known prior meniscal surgery, chondral \nand osteochondral lesions , and suspected loose bodies  [10].", "Next \nimaging procedure . \nWhen associated with acute injury, recommendations are covered in the  ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae topic on \n\u201cAcute Trauma to the Knee\u201d  [4].", "US Knee  \nUS is not often useful as a screening test or a comprehensive examination. It may be appropriate to confirm a \nsuspected effusio n and to guide a potential aspiration [10].  US is as accur ate in diagnosing a popliteal cyst and \ndetecting cyst rupture when compared to MRI [10]. US is also useful in evaluating medial plicae and following \npatients with iliotibial band syndrome [17 ,44]. \nMore recently, shear wave elastography has been used to evaluate female patients with patellofemoral pain by demonstrating reduced contraction ratio in the vastus medialis oblique but not the vastus lateralis muscles [49].  \nFinally, US can diagnose a cyst and determine the vascularity of a mass [37].  \nBone Scan Knee  \nRadionuclide bone scan is usually not indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a joint \neffusion .", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 5 Chronic Knee Pain  indirectly on radiographs by joint space narrowing and changes in the subchondral bone [10]. When a severe \nvarus or valgus deformity is present, significant cartilage loss in the apparently \u201cwider\u201d compartment may not be \nevident  [11,12]. Conversely, joint space narrowing may be caused by meniscal extrusion or degeneration rather \nthan cartilage loss [11].  \nChronic knee pain is associated with the radiographic demonstration of osteophytes with the development of a \n\u201cbone -on-bone\u201d appearance or complete joint space loss on sub sequent radiographs indicating disease progression \nand potentially indicating the need for arthroplasty [11-13].  \nRadiography Hip \nAn ipsilateral hip radiograph is usually not indicated as a first imaging examination . \nCT Knee  \nCT is usually not indicated as a first imaging examination.  \nCT Arthrography  Knee  \nCT arthrography is usually not indicated as a first imaging examination.  \nMRI Knee  \nMRI is usually not indicated as  a first imaging examination .

CT can also be used to \nevaluate trochlear morphology and the t ibial tubercle-t rochlear groove distance.  CT with IV  contrast is usually not \nindicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a joint effusion.  \nCT without and with IV contrast is not routinely performed when initial radiographs are negative.  \nCT Arthrography  Knee  \nWhen an intra -articular abnormality is suspected, CT arthrography may be  used instead of MRI to evaluate the \nmenisci and articular cartilage [16].  \nMRI Knee  \nWhen initial radiographs are normal or reveal a joint effusion but pain persists, the next indicated study is usually MRI without IV contrast, which is mo re sensitive than radiography  [11].  \nMRI accurately depicts the extent of an effusion, presence of synovitis, and presence or rupture of a popliteal cyst [17]. Subchondral cysts, articular cartilage,  and meniscal abnormalities are easily detected on MRI [13,18,19]. \nHowever, meniscal tears are often incidental findings in older patients with the majority of people over 70 years", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 9 Chronic Knee Pain  Radiography Hip \nAn ipsilateral hip radiograph is usually  not indicated  to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous \nknee injury.  \nCT Knee  \nCT without IV contrast  may be indicated to evaluate the patellofemoral anatomy in the setting of chronic knee \npain related t o repetitive patellofemoral subluxation , which can be suggested by a small osseous fragment along \nthe medial patellar margin  on axial knee radiographs [15]. CT kne e without IV contrast may also be useful to \nconfirm a prior osseous injury.  \nCT with IV contrast is not usually indicated to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  \nCT without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated to eva luate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous \nknee injury.  \nCT Arthrography  Knee  \nCT arthrography may be used to evaluate the menisci, articular cartilage, and the presence of loose bodies with \nreported sensitivities and specificities ranging from 86 % to 100%  [16,62-64 ]. \nMRI Knee  \nMRI without IV contrast may be indicated when radiographs demonstrate a small osseous fragment along the \nmedial patellar margin or if there is a clinical concern for prior or chronic patellar dislocation -relocation.  MRI can \nassess the integrity of the medial patellofemoral ligament and medial patellar retinaculum, define the extent of \ncartilage injury, and identify loose bodies [41].  MRI is useful for evaluating Osgood-Schlatter or Sinding -Larsen -\nJohansson syndrome [41].  If the radiograph suggests prior anterior cruciate ligament  injury, MRI can effectively \nevaluate the menisci , but evaluation for associated cartilage lesions is less useful [65].  \nMRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) \nosseous knee injury.  \nMR Arthrography  Knee  \nMR arthrography is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with s igns of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  \nUS Knee  \nUS is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  \nBone Scan Knee  \nRadionuclide bone scan is usually not indicated to evaluate patients with signs of prior  (chronic) osseous knee \ninjury.  \nImage -Guided Aspiration Knee  \nJoint aspiration is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  \nSummary of Recommendations  \n\u2022 Variant 1:  Radiographs  of the knee  are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of  chronic knee pain in \npatients greater than or equal to 5 years of age.  \n\u2022 Variant 2:  MRI knee without  IV contrast is usually appropriate in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of \nage with chronic knee pain when initial knee  radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion.  \n\u2022 Variant 3:  MRI knee without  IV contrast is usually appropriate  in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of \nage with chronic knee pain when initial knee radiographs demonstrate OCD,  loose bodies, or history of \ncartilage or meniscal repair.  \n\u2022 Variant 4:  (1) MRI knee without IV contrast  or (2)  knee aspiration or (3)  CT knee without  IV contrast may \nbe appropriate  in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of age with chronic knee pain when initial \nradiographs de monstrate degenerative changes or chondrocalcinosis. While MRI knee without  IV contrast \nmay be appropriate more often, knee aspiration and CT knee without IV contrast may be appropriate in \nspecific instances detailed in the narrative. On occasion, these ex aminations  may complement each other  with \nmore than one being appropriate .", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 8 Chronic Knee Pain  CT Knee  \nDual -energy CT without  IV contrast may be indicated if gout  or mixed crystal disease is a consideration.  \nOtherwise, CT i s not commonly used as a diagnostic test to evaluate patients with osteoarthritis or \nchondrocalcinosis.  Limited CT without IV contrast can be used for surgical planning.  \nCT Arthrography  Knee  \nCT arthrography is not commonly utilized as a second test in pati ents with arthritis even though CT is the most \naccurate method for evaluating cartilage abnormalities extending to the articular surface that is  due to the high \nspatial resolution between the contrast and the cartilage [11].  \nMRI Knee  \nMRI without IV contrast is not usually indicated in patients for whom radiographs are diagnostic of osteoarthritis \nunless symptoms are not explained by the radiographic findings (eg, s tress fractures) or the appropriate treatment \noption requires additional imaging [11, 19]. \nGiven the increased sensitivity of MRI for osteoarthritis, MRI may be indicated when more accurate or serial \ncartilage measurements are desired [10 ,55,56]. In patients >70 years of age, a higher correlation with the \n\u201cabnormal\u201d knee being painful is present when structural abnormalities are unilateral on either radiographs or \nMRI. S ince bilateral structural abnormalities can be present with primarily unilateral symptoms, the ability to \ndiscriminate painful from nonpainful knees is limited [57] . This persists even when using the MRI presence of \nsynovitis or effusion and/or a Kellgren and Lawrence score of \u2265 2; findings were reported to be the best \ndiscriminators between painful and asymptomatic knees [19].  \nPatellofemoral cartilage loss is closely associated with chronic knee pain with active knee pain correlated with BMLs [56]. Since MRI is more accurate than physical examination in identifying severe grades of \nchondromalacia patellae, it may be an appropriate screening tool prior to arthroscopy [58 ]. \nMRI with and without IV contrast is indicated when performing semiquantitative assessment of knee \nosteoarthritis using various scoring systems to include cartilage, synovitis, ligaments, BMLs , and menisci [18].  In \nobese patients with osteoarthritis on contrast -enhanced images, increased perfusion in Hoffa\u2019s fat is associated \nwith more severe anterior knee pain [59 ].  \nMR Arthrography  Knee  \nMR arthrography is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with osteoarthritis or chondrocalcinosis.  \nUS Knee  \nUS is not often useful as a screening test or a comprehensive examination.  US can detect synovial pathology, \neffusions , and cortical erosive changes [11]. Power Doppler US  can demonstrate increased synovial blood flow \nthat is associated with knee pain and can demonstrat e reduced blood flow , which correlates with reduced knee \npain following joint injections [60]. US can also demonstrate meniscal extrusion , a finding th at suggests an \nunderlying meniscal tear , and , on occasion , chondrocalcinosis and peripheral meniscal tears [11].  \nBone Scan Knee  \nRadionuclide bone scan  is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with chronic knee pain given the low \nspecificity and decreased anatomic resolution compared to CT or MRI [11].  However, i t may help distinguish \nbetween bone and soft -tissue origins for pain as well as localize pain to one or more joints [11].  \nImage -Guided Aspiration Knee  \nIf an effusion is present, US - or fluoroscopically guided joint aspiration can be performed for synovial fluid \nanalysis if there is concern for crystal disease or infection.  Corticosteroid injections can also be performed as they \nmay result in a 1  to 2 week reduction in synovitis on MR I in two -thirds of patients. MRI also demonstrates a \nsubsequent increase in the synovial volume in approximately 70% of patients that develop recurrent pain [61 ]. \nVariant 5:  Adult or child greater than or equal to 5 years of age.

Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and \nit can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain \nwith the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. \nTypically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain \npersists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  \nimaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated \nthat approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the \nprior year) radiographs [2 ]. \nThis document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  \u22655 years of age.  The \nvariants discussed include: (1) initial exam ination ; (2) initial radiograph is normal or demonstrates a joint \neffusion; (3) initial radiogr aph demonstrates osteochondritis dissecans (OCD), loose bodies or history of cartilage,  \nor meniscal repair; (4) initial radiograph demonstrates osteoarthritis or chondrocalcinosis; and (5)  initial \nradiograph demonstrates signs of prior (chronic) knee injur y (ie, Segond fract ure, tibial spine avulsion, etc ).  \nTo evaluat e knee pain associated with other conditions, please refer to the following ACR Appropriateness \nCriteria\u00ae topic on:  \u201cOsteonecrosi s of the Hip \u201d [3] for osteonecrosis,  \u201cAcute Trauma to the Knee \u201d for acute knee \ninjuries  [4], \u201cImaging After Total Knee Arthroplasty \u201d for patients with total knee arthroplasty  [5], \u201cSoft-Tissue \nMasses \u201d for a patient with a suspected soft -tissue mass [6], \u201cPrimary Bone Tumors \u201d for a patient with a suspected \nor known bone tumor [ 7], and \u201c Chronic Extremity Joint Pain -Suspected Inflammatory Arthritis \u201d for patient with \nsuspected arthritis  or synovitis [ 8]. \nSpecial Imaging  Considerations  \nKnee radiographs  should include at least one frontal projection of one or both knees (anteroposterior, Rosenberg, \nor tunnel), a tangential patellar view , and a lateral view of the affected knee [2,9]. Standing radiographs more \naccurately reflect medial and lateral compartment cartilage loss than supine radiographs with the posteromedial and posterolateral joint compartments  more accurately assessed using a weight -bearing flexion posteroanterior \nradiograph [9,10]. \nDiscussion of Pro cedures by Variant  \nVariant 1:  Adult or child greater than or equal to 5  year s of age .

In elderly patients, the most common \nsource of  chronic knee pain is osteoarthritis.", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 9 Chronic Knee Pain  Radiography Hip \nAn ipsilateral hip radiograph is usually  not indicated  to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous \nknee injury.  \nCT Knee  \nCT without IV contrast  may be indicated to evaluate the patellofemoral anatomy in the setting of chronic knee \npain related t o repetitive patellofemoral subluxation , which can be suggested by a small osseous fragment along \nthe medial patellar margin  on axial knee radiographs [15]. CT kne e without IV contrast may also be useful to \nconfirm a prior osseous injury.  \nCT with IV contrast is not usually indicated to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  \nCT without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated to eva luate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous \nknee injury.  \nCT Arthrography  Knee  \nCT arthrography may be used to evaluate the menisci, articular cartilage, and the presence of loose bodies with \nreported sensitivities and specificities ranging from 86 % to 100%  [16,62-64 ]. \nMRI Knee  \nMRI without IV contrast may be indicated when radiographs demonstrate a small osseous fragment along the \nmedial patellar margin or if there is a clinical concern for prior or chronic patellar dislocation -relocation.  MRI can \nassess the integrity of the medial patellofemoral ligament and medial patellar retinaculum, define the extent of \ncartilage injury, and identify loose bodies [41].  MRI is useful for evaluating Osgood-Schlatter or Sinding -Larsen -\nJohansson syndrome [41].  If the radiograph suggests prior anterior cruciate ligament  injury, MRI can effectively \nevaluate the menisci , but evaluation for associated cartilage lesions is less useful [65].  \nMRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) \nosseous knee injury.  \nMR Arthrography  Knee  \nMR arthrography is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with s igns of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  \nUS Knee  \nUS is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  \nBone Scan Knee  \nRadionuclide bone scan is usually not indicated to evaluate patients with signs of prior  (chronic) osseous knee \ninjury.  \nImage -Guided Aspiration Knee  \nJoint aspiration is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  \nSummary of Recommendations  \n\u2022 Variant 1:  Radiographs  of the knee  are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of  chronic knee pain in \npatients greater than or equal to 5 years of age.  \n\u2022 Variant 2:  MRI knee without  IV contrast is usually appropriate in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of \nage with chronic knee pain when initial knee  radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion.  \n\u2022 Variant 3:  MRI knee without  IV contrast is usually appropriate  in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of \nage with chronic knee pain when initial knee radiographs demonstrate OCD,  loose bodies, or history of \ncartilage or meniscal repair.  \n\u2022 Variant 4:  (1) MRI knee without IV contrast  or (2)  knee aspiration or (3)  CT knee without  IV contrast may \nbe appropriate  in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of age with chronic knee pain when initial \nradiographs de monstrate degenerative changes or chondrocalcinosis. While MRI knee without  IV contrast \nmay be appropriate more often, knee aspiration and CT knee without IV contrast may be appropriate in \nspecific instances detailed in the narrative. On occasion, these ex aminations  may complement each other  with \nmore than one being appropriate .", "US Knee  \nUS is not often useful as a screening test or a comprehensive examination. It may be appropriate to confirm a \nsuspected effusio n and to guide a potential aspiration [10].  US is as accur ate in diagnosing a popliteal cyst and \ndetecting cyst rupture when compared to MRI [10]. US is also useful in evaluating medial plicae and following \npatients with iliotibial band syndrome [17 ,44]. \nMore recently, shear wave elastography has been used to evaluate female patients with patellofemoral pain by demonstrating reduced contraction ratio in the vastus medialis oblique but not the vastus lateralis muscles [49].  \nFinally, US can diagnose a cyst and determine the vascularity of a mass [37].  \nBone Scan Knee  \nRadionuclide bone scan is usually not indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a joint \neffusion .", "WBC  Scan  and Sulfur  Colloid Scan  Knee  \nThere is insufficient  evidence  to support  the use of In-111 WBC and Tc-99m  sulfur  colloid  studies for the \nassessment  of rotational alignment  of a TKA.  \nVariant  6: Pain  after  total  knee  arthroplasty.  Suspect  periprosthetic soft-tissue abnormality  unrelated  to \ninfection, including  quadriceps  or patellar  tendinopathy  (quadriceps  or patellar  tendon tears,  postoperative  \narthrofibrosis,  patellar  clunk syndrome,  or impingement  of nerves or other  soft tissues).  Additional imaging  \nfollowing  radiographs.  \nThe incidence of quadriceps  or patellar  tendon tears after TKA is low, at 0.17%  to 2.5%  [149] . Sharkey  et al [12] \nreported  that the incidence of postoperative  arthrofibrosis  is also relatively  low, accounting for 4.5%  of failures in \nthis series and 6.9%  of failures where noted in the Lombardi  et al [111]  series.  Of note,  patients  with keloids  have  \nincreased  odds  risk of arthrofibrosis  following primary  TKA [150] .

Next imaging procedure . \nRadiography Hip \nAn ipsilateral hip radiograph is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with osteochondritis dissecans ( OCD) , \nloose bodies , or history of cartilage repair.  \nCT Knee  \nCT without IV contrast may be  indicated  to evaluate patients with OCD or a history of cartilage repair , especially \nto confirm loose bodies or when MRI is not definitive.  \nCT with IV contrast is not usually indicated to evaluate patients with OCD, loose bodies,  or history of cartilage \nrepair.  \nCT without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated to evaluate pati ents with OCD, loose bodies,  or history of \ncartilage repair.  \nCT Arthrography  Knee  \nCT arthrography may be used instead of MRI to evaluate the menisci, articular cartilage, and the presence of loose \nbodies [16].  \nMRI Knee  \nIn patients with OC D or subchondral insufficiency fracture on radiographs, MRI without IV contrast may be \nindicated if an additional injury is suspected clinically or to clarify the status of the overlying articular cartilage \n[41]. A hyperintense rim or cysts at the osteochondral fragment periphery on MRI are less specific for OCD fragment instability in children compared to adults; however, MRI is still useful to determine the best method of \ntreatment [41,50]. Following cartilage repair, MRI can grade the repair site and even guide the retrograde drilling \nof the OCD l esion [51-54] . \nMRI with and without IV contrast is not usually indicated  to evaluate patients with OCD, loose bodies,  or history \nof cartilage repair because of the  usual larger volume of joint fluid, the lesser degree of synovial invagination,  and \nthe longer time required to achieve steady state gadolinium in the joint compared to the shoulder [16].  \nMR Arthrography  Knee  \nMR arthrography is typically  reserved for patients with known prior meniscal surgery, chondral and \nosteochondral lesions, prior cartilage repair procedures, or suspected loose bodies [10, 16]. \nUS Knee  \nUS is not often useful as a screening test or a comprehensive examination.  It may be appropriate to localize \nsuspected loose bodies, especially if the loose bodies might be within a popliteal cyst , lateral recess, or \nsuprapatellar recess.  \nBone Scan Knee  \nRadionuclide bone scan is usually not indicated to evaluate patients with OCD, loose bodies,  or history of \ncartilage repair.  \nImage -Guided Aspiration Knee  \nJoint aspiration is usually not indicated to evaluate patients with OCD, loose bodies,  or history of cartilage repair.  \nVariant 4: Adult or child greater than or equal to 5 years of age .

New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or \npatients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee \npain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the \norigin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. \nSubchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed \nspontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to \nelderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs \noften initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, \nand progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is \nsuspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria\n\u00ae \ntopic on \u201c Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae \u201d [28]. \nSome patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using \nquantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs \nexhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ]. \nPatellofemoral car tilage loss is also associated with chronic knee pain , with active knee pain correlated with \nBMLs [30,31]. Similar to CT, MRI can calculate various anatomic measurements associated with patellofemoral \nsubluxation/dislocation and lateral patellofemoral friction syndrome [32-34]. Bone marrow edema in the classic \nlocation for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also \ndifferentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise \ntherapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. \nOther etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat \npad impingement syndromes, Hoffa\u2019s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome, adhesive \ncapsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes , \nand osteonecrosis [15, 19,36-45].  \nMRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a \njoint effusion. However, contrast -enhanced images ma y be more accurate in diagnosing other causes of chronic \nknee pain , such as Hoffa\u2019s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome, and adhesive \ncapsulitis [15].  In particular, enh ancing synovitis thicker than 2 mm in Hoffa\u2019s fat is correlated with peripatellar \npain [46]. Contrast -enhanced MRI is also useful in quantifying the degree of synovitis and in evaluating \nconditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis [ 17,42,47,48].  \nMR Arthrography  Knee  \nMR arthrography performed with an intra -articular injection of dilute gadolinium solution is typically not \nindicated as a second exam ination  but rather reserved for patients with known prior meniscal surgery, chondral \nand osteochondral lesions , and suspected loose bodies  [10].", "ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 10 Acute  Trauma  to the Knee  US study  by Dai et al including  551 patients  from  7 prospective  studies revealed  pooled sensitivity  of 88% and \nspecificity  of 90% in diagnosis  of meniscal  injuries  [46]. \nAnother  meta -analysis of 4 US studies including  246 patients  revealed  pooled sensitivity  of 90% and specificity  of \n97% in the diagnosis  of ACL  injuries  [47].

In a study \nby Mustonen  et al [12],  CT showed  100%  and radiographs  83% sensitivity  in detection  of tibial plateau fractures , \nand CT was superior  in further  characterization  of fracture  severity . \nIn the setting  of acute knee  trauma,  Mui et al [13] reported  80% sensitivity  and 98% specificity  of the CT \nexamination  in detecting  bony  avulsion  fractures and a high negative  predictive  value  for excluding  ligamentous  \ninjuries , but MRI remained  necessary  for the preoperative  detection  of meniscal  injury . \nPeltola  et al [14] compared  dual-energy  CT examinations  with MRI  studies as a reference standard  in 18 patients  \nwith acute knee  trauma  and reported  dual-energy  CT had 79% sensitivity  and 100%  specificity  in detecting  anterior  \ncruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures  [14]. \nIn a study  by Heffernan  et al [15], 64-channel  multidetector  CT showed  87.5% to 100%  sensitivity  and 100%  \nspecificity  for detection  of the ACL  tears.  As on MRI,  secondary  signs,  such as buckling  of the posterior  cruciate \nligament , were also useful  in their diagnosis.  In this study , multidetector  CT showed a low sensitivity  for other  soft-\ntissue injuries  at the knee;  however,  its high specificity  indicated  that apparent  posterior  cruciate  ligament , meniscal,  \nand collateral  ligament  tears can reliably  be treated  as true-positive  findings  [15]. \nThe dual-energy  CT virtual  noncalcium  technique  can subtract  calcium  from  cancellous bone,  allowing  detection  \n[16-18] and possibly grading of the post-traumatic  bone  marrow  contusions  [18]. \nHowever,  MRI is superior  to CT in detection  of bone  marrow  abnormalities  and meniscal  and ligamentous  injuries  \nand may be subsequently  performed  as clinically  indicated. \nMR Arth rography  Knee  \nWith  negative radiographs,  MR arthrography  is not routinely  used as the next imaging study  for the evaluation  of \nsuspected  occult  knee  fractures or internal  derangement . \nMRA Knee  \nWith  negative radiographs,  MRA  is not routinely  used as the next imaging study  for the evaluation  of suspected  \noccult  knee  fractures or internal  derangement . \nMRI Knee  \nMRI has many  distinct advantages for the evaluation  of the injured  knee  in the setting  of negative  radiographs.  \nThe majority  of patients  (93.5%)  who present  with acute  knee  injuries  in the emergency  department  sustained  soft-\ntissue injuries  rather  than osseous injuries  [19].  MRI  is a proven valuable  tool in the treatment  decision -making  \nprocess,  allowing  earlier  surgical  intervention  by obtaining  a more  accurate diagnosis  [20,21] .

In this patient population,  knee  effusion  >10 \nmm on lateral  radiograph  should prompt  consideration  for the knee  MRI examination , which  can potentially  \ndecrease delayed  diagnosis,  improve  patient  outcomes,  and decrease  disability  [25].  \nMagee et al [26] reported  96% sensitivity  and 97% specificity  of 3T MRI in the detection  of meniscal  tears in \ncorrelation  with arthroscopy .

Radiographs  can evaluate for unexpected  fracture,  unsuspected  \naggressive bony lesion,  osteoarthritis, inflammatory  arthropathy,  osteonecrosis,  or calcium  hydroxyapatite  \ndeposition.  Accurate  interpretation  of radiographs  can often  obviate  additional  imaging  or be complementary  to \nsubsequent  imaging studie s. A high-riding  humeral  head  on radiographs  is highly associated  with chronic  rotator  \ncuff tear [11], particularly  if seen in combination with sclerosis of the inferior acromion,  greater  tuberosity  cysts,  a \nlateral  acromial  spur, and cortical  irregularity  or sclerosis of the greater  tuberosity  [12-14]. \nUS Shoulder  \nThe literature  suggests that radiographic  evaluation  should  generally  be the first imaging  study  ordered  in patients  \nwith shoulder  pain [1,10-14] .

CT arthrography provides  a \ncomparable alternative  to MR arthrography in the evaluation  of rotator  cuff tendon tears [16,17] . CT arthrography \nis able to detect  very subtle  articular  surface cuff defects,  but, because of lack of contrast  extension  from  the \nglenohumeral  joint space,  it is less effective at demonstrating bursal  surface or intrasubstance tears,  which  are \ntypically  well seen with MRI or US [18]. \nCT Shoulder  With  IV Contrast  \nThere is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of CT shoulder  with IV contrast  in the evaluation  of chronic  \nshoulder  pain when  rotator  cuff disorder  or subacromial  subdeltoid bursitis  is suspected.  \nCT Shoulder  Without  and With  IV Contrast  \nThere is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of CT shoulder  without  and with IV contrast  in the evaluation  of \nchronic  shoulder  pain when  rotator  cuff disorder  or subacromial  subdeltoid  bursitis  is suspected.  \nCT Shoulder  Without  IV Contrast  \nCT shoulder  without  IV contrast  is of limited  utility  when  evaluating  for rotator  cuff tear or subacromial  subdeltoid  \nbursitis. Noncontrast  CT can sometimes  demonstrate fatty infiltration  of rotator  cuff muscles with a corresponding \nrotator  cuff tear, although  the overall  sensitivity  of this finding  is low [19]. CT may demonstrate a high-riding  \nhumeral  head  or remodeling  of the acromial  undersurface in patients  with large  rotator  cuff tears.  However,  this \nfinding  is generally  seen on initial radiographs , and CT does not allow  for characterization  of the underlying tear \nbecause CT lacks the soft-tissue contrast  resolution  necessary  to adequately  evaluate the rotator  cuff tear itself.  CT \nmay be able to directly  demonstrate  some  large rotator  cuff tears  as well as fatty infiltration  of the rotator  cuff \nmusculature;  however , it was found to have  a sensitivity  of 20% for full thickness  rotator  cuff tears in one small  \nstudy [19].

At times  US may have  \ndifficulty  distinguishing calcific  deposits  from  heterotopic  ossification  because both can result  in dense shadowing  \nat US. US can be used if there  is concern  for concomitant  rotator  cuff tendon tear and may be a better  modality  than \nMRI in this situation  given the difficulty  of distinguishing  calcium  from  normal  tendon at MRI.  \nVariant  4: Chronic  shoulder  pain.

Labral  evaluation  in the postoperative  \nsetting  may be better  with CT arthrography than MRI  in patients  with metallic  suture  anchors  [73] and has been  \nused to evaluate for healing  after superior  labrum  anterior -to-posterior  (SLAP)  repair  [74]. Dual -energy  CT \narthrography  has a similar  diagnostic  performance  as MR arthrography  [75]. Although CT arthrography aids in the \nevaluation  of underlying soft tissues,  the injected  contrast  may limit evaluation  of the underlying osseous structures,  \nand cortical  fragments in the injected  contrast  solution  often  have a similar  attenuation  to cortical  bone  [76].

CT is often  preferable  to MRI when  evaluating  for small  \nfracture  fragments of the glenoid rim and assessing  bone  stock  in patients  with recurrent  dislocation  [77-79]. Three-\ndimensional  reconstructions  can be used to quantify  osseous defect  width  and glenoid  surface area [80,81] . CT can \nalso be used to measure the size of a Hill-Sachs defect  [82,83] , which  has become more  important  with the \ndevelopment  of the glenoid track  concept  for determining  instability  [84,85] .

Along with a thorough history and physical  examination,  imaging  plays  a critical  role in determining the \nsource of chronic  shoul der pain.  Common pain generators in the shoulder  include  the rotator  cuff tendons,  biceps \ntendon,  labrum,  glenohumeral  articular  cartilage,  acromioclavicular  joint, bones,  suprascapular  and axillary  nerves,  \nand the joint capsule/synovium.  Imaging  can help to guide  appropriate  therapy , which  can range  from  conservative  \nmeasures such as physical  therapy  and cortico steroid  injections  to more  invasive  procedures  such as arthroscopy or \nsurgery .

Isotropic  3-D imaging has been  increasingly  used as a substitute  for \nconventional  multiplanar  2-D MRI,  with a similar  sensitivity  and specificity  for rotator  cuff tear and labral  \nabnormalities  at a lower  scan time [7,8] . Faster  scans can also be performed  using 2-D fast spin echo  sequences  \nwith parallel  imaging , which  produce  similar  findings  as seen on conventional  MRI [9]. \nInitial Imaging  Definition \nInitial imaging  is defined  as imaging  at the beginning of the care episode for the medical  condition defined  by the \nvariant.

Image -guided cortico steroid  injection  has been  shown  to have  a significant  reduction in pain and \nan improvement  in the range  of motion  for patients  with adhesive capsulitis  [105,106] . Use of US guidance  for \nglenohumeral  cortico steroid  injection  may be more  accurate and produce  a greater  improvement  in pain and \nfunctional  scores relative  to blind  injection  [107] . Patients  with adhesive capsulitis  have  been  found to be the only \ngroup with a statistically  better  outcome  after glenohumeral  joint injection  than other  patients;  thus a positive  \nresponse to a glenohumeral  injection  can be suggestive  of the presence of adhesive capsulitis  in the appropriate  \nclinical  context  [23]. Fluoroscopic  injection  can also demonstrate diagnostic  findings  suggestive of adhesive  \ncapsulitis  including  joint space capacity  <10 mL, diminished axillary  recess,  and irregularity  of the capsular  margin  \n[108] . \nMR Arthrography  Shoulder  \nMengiardi  et al [109]  reported  that thickening  of the coracohumeral  ligament  (specificity  95%,  sensitivity  59%),  \nthickening  of the joint capsule (specificity  86%,  sensitivity  64%) , and obliteration  of the subcoracoid  triangle  \n(specificity  100%,  sensitivity  32%)  are characteristic  MR arthrograph y findings  in adhesive capsulitis . However,  \nfluid  within  the rotator  interval  or along  the axillary  recess due to the arthrogram  injection  itself  can serve as a \nlimitation  to detecting  findings  of adhesive capsulitis  on MRI arthrography.  \nMRI Shoulder  Without  and With  IV Contrast  \nContrast -enhanced  MRI can increase the conspicuity of axillary  recess capsular  thickening [110]  and rotator  interval  \nsoft-tissue thickening [111] , although there  are conflicting  data on the relationship  of this capsular  enhancement  \nwith patient  symptoms  [112] . \nMRI Shoulder  Without  IV Contrast  \nZhao  et al [113]  showed  that coracohumeral  ligament thickening,  anterior  capsule thickening,  and obliteration  of \nthe subcoracoid  fat are the most  characteristic findings  of adhesive capsulitis  on conventional  MRI.

CT measurements of glenoid version,  glenoid  bone  \nloss, and humeral  head  subluxation demonstrate  high interrater  reliability  [141] . CT can potentially  demonstrate  \nrotator  cuff muscle  fatty infiltration, which  is often  associated  with rotator  cuff tears;  however , overall  sensitivity  \nfor full thickness rotator  cuff tears is only 20% for noncontrast  CT [19]. \nFDG -PET/CT  Skull Base to Mid-Thigh \nThere is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of FDG -PET/CT skull  base to mid-thigh  in the evaluation  of chronic  \nshoulder  pain when  initial radiographs  demonstrate  osteoarthritis.  \nImage -Guided Anesthetic +/- Corticosteroid  Injection  Shoulder  or Surrounding  Structures  \nIntra -articular  cortico steroid  injection  using either  fluoroscopy or US guidance  is often  used in the conservative \nmanagement  of glenohumeral  arthritis  [122]  and may be performed  in some  situations  before  advanced  imaging  is \nobtained.

MR arthrogra phy adds additional  benefit  to conventional  \nshoulder  MRI  because it may identify  some  labral  tears that are not seen with conventional  MRI  [95]. The increased  \naccuracy  with MR arthrog raphy should be balanced  against  the need  for an invasive  arthrogram  procedure.  \nAlthough evaluation  of glenoid bony integrity  is typically  better  with CT imaging,  some  practitioners have  used \nultrashort  or zero echo  time sequences [96-98], 3-D sequences  [99], or conventional  MRI  sequences  [100]  to \nmeasure glenoid bone  loss with a high concordance  to CT images.  \nRadiography Shoulder  Additional Views  \nThere are several  options  for additional  radiographic  views in patients  with suspected  instability  [1].

CT may demonstrate a high-riding  \nhumeral  head  or remodeling  of the acromial  undersurface in patients  with large  rotator  cuff tears.  However,  this \nfinding  is generally  seen on initial radiographs , and CT does not allow  for characterization  of the underlying tear \nbecause CT lacks the soft-tissue contrast  resolution  necessary  to adequately  evaluate the rotator  cuff tear itself.

MRI has been shown to have similar performance to CT in the evaluation of Hill-Sachs \nlesions and glenoid bone loss [12,18]. MR arthrography has also been found to be reliable in diagnosi ng anterior \nshoulder instability and labroligamentous injuries [58,59]. MR arthrography has specifically o utperformed \nnoncontrast MRI in assessment of glenohumeral ligament and anterior labral injuries [ 17,19], which ar e \ncommonly seen in shoulder instability. MR arthrogr aphy has also outperformed noncontrast MRI in diagnosis of \nrotator cuff tears [17,19], which is a common associated finding in older patients with shoulder dislocation. \nHowever, high sensitivities reported for MR arthrography in the detection of labral pathology may not be \napplicable to patients with clinically unstable shoulders. A retrospective review of 90 patients with clinically \nunstable shoulders selected for arthroscopy [ 60] found that MR arthrography had a sensitivity of 65% for \ndetection of labral  tears. The authors proposed that this discrepancy with prior studies was the result of different \npatient selection criteria (clinically unstable in their study versus less-specific symptoms such as shoulder pain in \nothers) and the interpretation of MR art hrography by experienced musculoskeletal radiologists [ 60]. For this \ndocument, it is assumed the procedure is performed and interpreted by an expert.  \nMRI Shoulder  \nMRI without contrast may be pre ferred to MR arthrography in the setting of acute shoulder dislocation when a \npost-traumatic joint effusion is present to provide sufficient visualization of soft -tissue structures. In the subacute \nor chronic setting, the glenohumeral joint effusion is usually too small to provide adequate joint distention for \noptimal assessment  of soft -tissue structures. Non contrast MRI has been shown to be inferior to MR arthrography \nin diagnosing labroligamentous and rotator cuff injuries [17,19]. Non contrast MRI performs comparably to CT in \nevaluating glenoid and humeral head bone loss [ 12,18], which may obviate the need for noncontrast CT . \nCT Arthrography  Shoulder  \nCT arthrography is effective in evaluation of shoulder instability. CT arthrogr aphy is comparable to MR \narthrography in the diagnosis of Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions [12] , and moderate agreement has been found \nbetween readers for diagnosing ant erior capsule laxity on CT arthrography. However, CT arthrography has been \nshown to be inferior to MR arthrography in assessing partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [12], which makes CT \narthrography less desirable in older patients with dislocation/instability where rotator cuff tears are common. CT \narthrography may be considered in a patient with shoulder dislocation/instabili ty and contraindication to MRI.  \nCT Shoulder  \nNoncontrast CT has historically been performed to assess bone loss in patients with recurrent dislocation or \nchronic instability. However, recent studies have shown MRI to be equivalent to CT in assessment of glenoid and \nhumeral head bone loss [12,18], which places in question the need for noncontrast CT in the assessment of \nshoulder instability. Noncontrast CT is als o unable to assess rotator cuff and labroligamentous pathology \ncommonly seen in shoulder dislocations/instability. In general, CT should be reserved for patients with a \ncontraindication to MRI or patients in whom MRI assessment of bone loss is limited.  \nUS Shoulder  \nThere is no defined role for US  in the assessment of shoulder dislocation  or instability.

Indirect  MR arthrography has been  shown  to have  a slightly  higher  specificity  for diagnosing articular -\nsurface partial thickness tears  of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus  tendons,  as well as a greater  specificity  for \ndiagnosing subscapularis tendon tears [35], relative  to noncontrast  MRI,  and has shown  high accuracy  relative  to \narthroscopy [36]. Although the accuracy  of indirect  MR arthrography has been  descr ibed in the literature, it is not \ncommonly used in clinical  practice.  \nMRI Shoulder  Without  IV Contrast  \nMRI of the shoulder  is a highly  accurate tool in the assessment  of the rotator  cuff. MRI findings  of tendinopathy  \nconsist  of intermediate increased  signal  and tendon thickening [28].

Sensitivity  \nand specificity  for detecting  partial  thickness bursal  surface  tears is similar  for conventional  MRI and MR \narthrography  [27]. Although MR arthrography may have  a slightly  higher  sensitivity  and specificity  than \nconventional  MRI for diagnosing  rotator  cuff tears,  particularly  partial  thickness articular  surface tears,  this \ndifference in accuracy  must  be weighed  against  the need  for an invasive  arthrogram  procedure  [29]. Tendon \nretraction,  muscle atrophy,  and fatty infiltration  are associated  important  findings  that are well seen on MRI  and \npredict  reparability  of rotator  cuff tear [40]. Axial  images  can be helpful  in determining  rotator  cuff tear shape  [41], \nwhich  can aid in the selection  of a particular  surgical  technique.  In addition  to evaluating  the rotator  cuff itself , MRI  \ncan detect  extra-articular  abnormalities  that may predispose  to shoulder  impingemen t such as acromioclavicular  \ndegenerative change  or a subacromial  spur. Fluid  accumul ation  within  the subacromial  subdeltoid  bursa  is \nvisualized  on MRI and is often  a nonspecific finding  seen with a rotator  cuff tear or an underlying  inflammatory  \ndisorder  [42]. \nRadiography Shoulder  Additional Views  \nThe rotator  cuff tendons  cannot  be directly  assessed  radiographically,  regardless of the view.  Secondary  findings  of \nrotator  cuff tear such as a high-riding  humeral  head  or changes at the greater  tuberosity  can be seen on standard  \nradiographic  views.  There have  been  several  reports  assessing  special  views for the evaluation  of potential  \nimpingement  from  the anterior  acromion.  Outlet  views  can be used to determine acromial  shape  and have  been  \nshown  to be more  accurate than a single -slice MRI [43]. The Rockwood  and cassette tilt views  are angled  frontal  \nprojection s that can be used to detect  anterior  acromial  osteophyte s [44]. The subacromial  subdeltoid bursa  is a soft-\ntissue potential space and is not directly  visualized  on radiographs.  There is a peribursal  fat plane  between  the \nrotator  cuff tendons  and the deltoid  muscle;  however , obliteration  of the peribursal  fat stripe  is not a specific  \nindicator  of shoulder  pathology and may be seen in normal  subjects [42]."], ["Postoperative  abnormalities  and associated  conditions  include  patients\u2019  dissatisfaction,  prosthetic  \nloosening,  glenohumeral  instability, polyethylene  wear,  osteolysis,  periprosthetic  fracture,  impingement  (mainly  \nwith reverse  total shoulder  arthroplasti es), tears of the rotator  cuff tendons,  infection, nerve  injury,  and deltoid  \ndysfunction [3]. The most  common  complication  for hemiarthroplasties has been  erosion  of the unresurfaced  \nglenoid (20.6%),  whereas glenoid loosening (14.3%)  has been  reported  as the most  common  complication  for total \nshoulder  arthroplasties [6]. The rate of perioperative  complications, such as blood loss, thromboembolism,  and \nimmediate  postoperative  infection, has been  shown  to be similar  for both types  of surgeries [7]. The most  common  \ncomplications  associated  with reverse total shoulder  arthroplasties  are scapular  notching,  dislocation,  periprosthetic  \nfractures,  glenoid baseplate failure,  and acromial  fractures [8,9] . \nSymptoms  relate d to postoperative  difficulties  include  activity -related  pain,  decreased  range  of motion,  and \napprehension.

Kransdorf,  MD.n \nSummary  of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nThere has been  a rapid  increase  in the number  of shoulder  arthroplasties,  including  partial  or complete humeral  head  \nresurfacing,  hemiarthroplasty,  total shoulder  arthroplasty,  and reverse total shoulder  arthroplasty,  performed  in the \nUnited  States  over the past 2 decades [1]. The most  recent  published estimates have  reported  a 2.5-fold  increase in \nthe number  of shoulder  arthroplasties performed  between  1998 and 2008,  from  19,000 to 47,000 [1,2] . Overall,  \ntotal shoulder  arthroplasties are the most  common  type,  having surpassed  hemiarthroplasties in the last decade [1]. \nMost  shoulder  arthroplasties are performed  for degenerative  conditions.  Humeral  head  resurfacing  is indicated  in \npatients  with humeral  head  osteonecrosis,  large Hill-Sachs deformity,  or focal  osteoarthrosis.  Hemiarthroplasties  \nare typically  performed  in patients  with osteoarthrosis limited  to the humeral  head  or in patients  with comminuted  \nhumeral  head  fractures.  Hemiarthroplasties are also recommended  in patients  with deficient  glenoid bone  stock  and \nin patients  with greater  preoperative  comorbidities  because they require  a shorter  intraoperative  time compared  with \ntotal shoulder  arthroplasty.  Presently,  total shoulder  arthroplasty  is recommended  over hemiarthroplasty  for \nadvanced  shoulder  osteoarthrosis because of its superior  clinical  outcome.  \nReverse shoulder  arthroplasties  were first introduced in 1987  as a treatment  option for patients  with a deficient  \nrotator  cuff and have  been  used as a salvage procedure  for patients  with failed  total shoulder  arthroplasties [3,4] . \nReverse  shoulder  arthroplasties are constructed  differently  from  total shoulder  arthroplasties to compensate  for the \nlack of stabilization  related  to the deficient  rotator  cuff. The glenoid  component  is a round  metal  ball (referred  to as \nthe glenosphere)  attached  to a baseplate along the glenoid surface,  and the humeral  component  has a cup-shaped  \narticular  margin  secured  by a metal  stem  [4]. The construct  moves  the center  of rotation  medial  and distal, which  \nallows the deltoid  muscle to serve as a main  stabilizer  of the arthroplasty  and joint [4]. Additionally,  the more  \nmedial  and distal  center  of rotation  decreases the risk of glenoid loosening [4,5] . \nThe complication  rate for shoulder  arthroplasties has been  reported  to be as high as 39.8%,  with revision  rates up \nto 11% [6].", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 6 Chronic Shoulder Pain  Discussion  of Procedures  by Variant  \nVariant  1: Chronic  shoulder  pain.

Radiographs  can evaluate for unexpected  fracture,  unsuspected  \naggressive bony lesion,  osteoarthritis, inflammatory  arthropathy,  osteonecrosis,  or calcium  hydroxyapatite  \ndeposition.  Accurate  interpretation  of radiographs  can often  obviate  additional  imaging  or be complementary  to \nsubsequent  imaging studie s. A high-riding  humeral  head  on radiographs  is highly associated  with chronic  rotator  \ncuff tear [11], particularly  if seen in combination with sclerosis of the inferior acromion,  greater  tuberosity  cysts,  a \nlateral  acromial  spur, and cortical  irregularity  or sclerosis of the greater  tuberosity  [12-14]. \nUS Shoulder  \nThe literature  suggests that radiographic  evaluation  should  generally  be the first imaging  study  ordered  in patients  \nwith shoulder  pain [1,10-14] .

These may include  anterior -posterior,  anterior -posterior  Grashey,  scapular  Y, and axillary  \nviews [10,13] . Intraoperative  and immediate  postoperative  radiographs  are also ordered  by some  surgeons,  but their \nbenefit , without a specific indication,  has been  questioned  because of  limitations  inherent  to the portable  nature  of \nthe exam ination , patients\u2019  difficulties  in cooperating with the various  views,  and low impact  on overall  patient  care \n[14]. The frequency  of follow -up radiographs  varies depending  on the surgeon\u2019s  preference but usually  accompanies  \ntheir follow -up visits  anywhere  between  3 months  and 1 year postsurgery . The routine  use of radiographic  imaging  \nin the first postoperative  year in asymptomatic patients  has been  called  into question  in a 2017 assessment  [15]. \nRadiographs  are also typically  ordered  for yearly  follow -up examinations  to assess interval  changes  in the bone  \nsurrounding the prosthesis  [16]. The presence  of scapular  notching on postoperative  radiographs  of reverse total \nshoulder  prostheses has been  associated  with poor clinical  outcomes  [17]. The risk for loosening  increases over \ntime, with notable  radiographic  changes associated  with loosening found at least 5 years after surgery,  most  \ncommonly involving  the glenoid component  [18]. Late complications  requiring  revision  surgery,  such as loosening,  \ninfection, and fracture,  occurring up to 15 years postoperatively , suggests the need  for long-term  radiographic  \nfollow -up when  these complications  are asymptomatic or their outcome  can be affected  by early  detection  on \nradiographs  [10]. \nUS Shoulder  \nUS examinations  are not typically  ordered  for evaluation  of the asymptomatic patient. \nVariant  2: Symptomatic  patient  with  a primary  shoulder  arthroplasty .

These may include  anterior -posterior,  anterior -posterior  Grashey,  scapular  Y, and axillary  \nviews [10,13] . Intraoperative  and immediate  postoperative  radiographs  are also ordered  by some  surgeons,  but their \nbenefit , without a specific indication,  has been  questioned  because of  limitations  inherent  to the portable  nature  of \nthe exam ination , patients\u2019  difficulties  in cooperating with the various  views,  and low impact  on overall  patient  care \n[14]. The frequency  of follow -up radiographs  varies depending  on the surgeon\u2019s  preference but usually  accompanies  \ntheir follow -up visits  anywhere  between  3 months  and 1 year postsurgery . The routine  use of radiographic  imaging  \nin the first postoperative  year in asymptomatic patients  has been  called  into question  in a 2017 assessment  [15]. \nRadiographs  are also typically  ordered  for yearly  follow -up examinations  to assess interval  changes  in the bone  \nsurrounding the prosthesis  [16].

Kransdorf, MD.n \nSummary  of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nIt has been  approximately  60 years since Sir John Charnl ey introduced the modern era of hip replacement  surgery  \n[1]. Approximately  370,000 primary  total hip arthroplasties (THAs)  were performed  in the United  States in 2014  \n[2]. Sloan  et al [2] estimated  that the volume of primary  THAs  would  increase to 635,000 procedure s annually by \n2030.  \nOver  the years,  modifications  have  been  made  to attempt  to decrease  complications  such as loosening and wear  \nwith additional  fixation  techniques  (eg, osseointegration ) and articular  surfaces  (eg, metal  on highly  cross -linked  \npolyethylene , antioxidant  doped polyethylene  liners,  metal -on-metal  [MoM], ceramic on polyethylene , and ceramic  \non ceramic articulations)  [3-5]. \nSecond -generation  MoM prostheses were introduced in the late 1990s  [6]. These  prostheses were preferentially  \nused for younger  patients  with osteoarthritis  [7]. However , reports  of high short -term  failure  rates led to recalls  and \ndecreased  use [8,9] . These articulations  (and also metal  to metal  articulations  at the head  neck  [trunnion] and neck  \nstem  articulation s of modular  components)  may result  in the release of metal  particles and metal  ions leading  to \nmacroscopic necrosis,  osteolysis,  large sterile  hip effusions,  and periprosthetic  solid  and cystic masses termed  \n\u201cpseudotumors\u201d  [10]. The umbrella  terms  adverse local  tissue reaction  (ALTR ) and adverse reaction  to metal  debris  \n(ARMD ) have been  used to refer  to the spectrum  of findings  in failed  metal  on metal  articulations  [11-13]. The \nterm metallosis  refers  to infiltration  of metallic  wear  debris  into periprosthetic  structures [14]. \nThe most  common  causes  for surgical  revision  of THA  from 2012 to 2019 as reported  in the American  Academy  \nof Orthopaedic  Surgeons  American  Joint  Replacement  Registry  were infection  and inflammatory  reaction  (19.3%),  \ninstability  (17.4%),  and aseptic loosening (15.8% ) [15-17]. Wear  or osteolysis was the cause for revision  in 7.5%.  \nThe imaging studies used to follow uncomplicated primary hip prostheses and to assess several prosthesis-related \ncomplications are reviewed . Separate discussions pertinent to imaging of MoM prostheses are included.  \nSpecial Imaging  Considerations  \nUltrasound (US) : US has been  used for assessment  of soft tissues adjacent  to hip arthroplasties and, in contrast  to \nMRI and CT, is not affected  by prosthetic  artifacts.  US may be limited  in its ability  to assess deep  soft tissues.  \nMetal artifact reduction sequences ( MAR S)-MRI : MARS -MRI enable soft tissues around the prosthetic  hip such as \nthe pseudocapsule,  tendons , and neurovascular  structures to be assessed .", "Galley et al [110]  used optimized  MRI  sequences and found irregular  soft tissue mass,  soft tissue edema,  bone  \ndestruction,  and fistulas  to be significant  features  of periprosthetic  infection, with sensitivities  of 47.4%  to 100% \nand specificities of 73.1%  to 100.0%.  Albano et al [109]  found  lymph  node  assessment  (of the affected  compared  \nto the unaffected  hip) identified  infected  implants  with high accuracies (up to 93.1%).  Galley  et al [110]  found \nperiosteal  reaction, capsular  edema,  and intramuscular  edema after THA at 1.5T MRI with MAR  to have  high \naccuracy  in the evaluation  of periprosthetic  joint infection  (86%-91%  accuracy).  Schwaiger  et al [112]  were able to \ndistinguis h patients  with infection  from  those  with loosening  using MRI features.  Soft tissue edema (sensitivity,  \n86.7%  and specificity , >73.3% ), abnormalities  at both acetabular  and femoral  components  (sensitivity/specificity,  \n66.7% /93.3% -100% ), and enlarged  lymph nodes  (80% /86.7% ) enabled  this differentiation . \nRadiographic  Arthrography  Hip \nThere is no recent  literature  to support  the current  use of conventional  arthrography of the hip in the evaluation  of \nperiprosthetic  infection . \nUS Hip \nDetection  of joint effusion , fluid  collections,  and sinus  tracts is possible with US, and, therefore,  this modality  is \nhelpful  in identifying  infection  [47].

Kransdorf, MD.n \nSummary  of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nIt has been  approximately  60 years since Sir John Charnl ey introduced the modern era of hip replacement  surgery  \n[1]. Approximately  370,000 primary  total hip arthroplasties (THAs)  were performed  in the United  States in 2014  \n[2]. Sloan  et al [2] estimated  that the volume of primary  THAs  would  increase to 635,000 procedure s annually by \n2030.  \nOver  the years,  modifications  have  been  made  to attempt  to decrease  complications  such as loosening and wear  \nwith additional  fixation  techniques  (eg, osseointegration ) and articular  surfaces  (eg, metal  on highly  cross -linked  \npolyethylene , antioxidant  doped polyethylene  liners,  metal -on-metal  [MoM], ceramic on polyethylene , and ceramic  \non ceramic articulations)  [3-5]. \nSecond -generation  MoM prostheses were introduced in the late 1990s  [6]. These  prostheses were preferentially  \nused for younger  patients  with osteoarthritis  [7]. However , reports  of high short -term  failure  rates led to recalls  and \ndecreased  use [8,9] . These articulations  (and also metal  to metal  articulations  at the head  neck  [trunnion] and neck  \nstem  articulation s of modular  components)  may result  in the release of metal  particles and metal  ions leading  to \nmacroscopic necrosis,  osteolysis,  large sterile  hip effusions,  and periprosthetic  solid  and cystic masses termed  \n\u201cpseudotumors\u201d  [10]. The umbrella  terms  adverse local  tissue reaction  (ALTR ) and adverse reaction  to metal  debris  \n(ARMD ) have been  used to refer  to the spectrum  of findings  in failed  metal  on metal  articulations  [11-13]. The \nterm metallosis  refers  to infiltration  of metallic  wear  debris  into periprosthetic  structures [14]. \nThe most  common  causes  for surgical  revision  of THA  from 2012 to 2019 as reported  in the American  Academy  \nof Orthopaedic  Surgeons  American  Joint  Replacement  Registry  were infection  and inflammatory  reaction  (19.3%),  \ninstability  (17.4%),  and aseptic loosening (15.8% ) [15-17]. Wear  or osteolysis was the cause for revision  in 7.5%.  \nThe imaging studies used to follow uncomplicated primary hip prostheses and to assess several prosthesis-related \ncomplications are reviewed . Separate discussions pertinent to imaging of MoM prostheses are included.  \nSpecial Imaging  Considerations  \nUltrasound (US) : US has been  used for assessment  of soft tissues adjacent  to hip arthroplasties and, in contrast  to \nMRI and CT, is not affected  by prosthetic  artifacts.

Kransdorf,  MD.o  \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nFractures of the proximal femur (commonly referred to as hip fractures)  are a frequent  source of morbidity and \nmortality in elderly osteoporotic patients [1]. Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type \nresult in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men \n[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs \nwill continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of \nlife following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays \nin diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -\nand long-term mortality [6-13]. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of hip fractures is critical. Hip fractures \ncannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded on the basis of physical exam ination  alone ; therefore , imaging plays a \nkey role in early  and accurate diagnosis [14] . \nThe biomechanics of proximal femoral and pelvic fractures that are a result of major trauma differs as these \ninjuries may be seen in any age group, often with additional accompanying high-velocity injuri es of the abdomen \nand pelvis . Motor vehicle \u2013related trauma is the most common  mechanism. Thorough evaluation of the hip may be \nsuperseded  in these instances by the need for resuscitation and diagnosis and treatment of more urgent associated \nvascular or solid organ injuries. Imaging plays an important role not only in the diagnosis of high-velocity \nfractures but also in characterizing fracture mechanism and morphology for treatment planning purposes.  \nHowever, imaging of high-velocity hip fractures occurs in the context of a broader trauma evaluation. A full \ndiscussion of the broader imaging workup of blunt trauma is beyond the scope of this paper and will be covered in \nthe upcoming ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae titled \u201cMajor Blunt Trauma\u201d and will be made available on the \nACR website  when completed . \nTreatment  for both intra - and extracapsular proximal femoral fractures in the elderly is typically surgical fixation  \nbecause of the risk of further fracture displacement and the dangers of prolonged immobilization in the elderly \n[15]. Joint replacement may be  performed for displaced fractures of the femoral neck where the risk of femoral \nhead avascular necrosis is high. Fractures from high -force trauma are also commonly treated with surgical \nfixation for stability to reduce the risk of post -traumatic osteo arthritis. \nDiscussion of Procedures by Variant  \nVariant 1:  Acute hip pain. Fall or minor trauma. Suspect fracture. Initial imaging.  \nRadiography Hip \nRadiography is the initial imaging modality of choice for assessment of acute hip pain with suspected fracture , \nwith the more advanced imaging modalities reserved for instances of clinically suspected fracture in the setting of \nnegative or equivocal radiographs. Radiographs are rapidly obtained and well tolerated by patients. When a \nfracture is demonstrated , freque ntly no more imaging is needed for treatment planning purposes [15 -17].", "Identifying the cause of a painful  TKA  before  surgery  is critically  important  because  \n\u201cin cases of unexplained pain,  reoperation  is unwise and frequently  associated  with suboptimal  results\u201d [14]. \nSpecial Imaging  Considerations   \nIn some  patients with knee  arthroplasties,  repeated  hemarthroses are caused  by synovial  hyperemia  or true \narteriovenous  malformations.  These patients can be successfully  diagnosed with angiography and treated  with \nembolization. In rare instances,  geniculate and popliteal vessel  injuries  may occur  during surgery  [15]. \nA recent  study reports  single -photon emission  CT (SPECT)/CT  arthrography with Tc-99m  sulfur  colloid  has a high \ndiagnostic  accuracy  (97%)  in the evaluation  of loosening of both hip and knee  arthroplasties in patients with \npersistent  postprocedural  pain [16].

Kransdorf,  MD.o  \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nFractures of the proximal femur (commonly referred to as hip fractures)  are a frequent  source of morbidity and \nmortality in elderly osteoporotic patients [1]. Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type \nresult in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men \n[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs \nwill continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of \nlife following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays \nin diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -\nand long-term mortality [6-13]. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of hip fractures is critical. Hip fractures \ncannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded on the basis of physical exam ination  alone ; therefore , imaging plays a \nkey role in early  and accurate diagnosis [14] . \nThe biomechanics of proximal femoral and pelvic fractures that are a result of major trauma differs as these \ninjuries may be seen in any age group, often with additional accompanying high-velocity injuri es of the abdomen \nand pelvis . Motor vehicle \u2013related trauma is the most common  mechanism. Thorough evaluation of the hip may be \nsuperseded  in these instances by the need for resuscitation and diagnosis and treatment of more urgent associated \nvascular or solid organ injuries. Imaging plays an important role not only in the diagnosis of high-velocity \nfractures but also in characterizing fracture mechanism and morphology for treatment planning purposes.  \nHowever, imaging of high-velocity hip fractures occurs in the context of a broader trauma evaluation. A full \ndiscussion of the broader imaging workup of blunt trauma is beyond the scope of this paper and will be covered in \nthe upcoming ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae titled \u201cMajor Blunt Trauma\u201d and will be made available on the \nACR website  when completed . \nTreatment  for both intra - and extracapsular proximal femoral fractures in the elderly is typically surgical fixation  \nbecause of the risk of further fracture displacement and the dangers of prolonged immobilization in the elderly \n[15]. Joint replacement may be  performed for displaced fractures of the femoral neck where the risk of femoral \nhead avascular necrosis is high. Fractures from high -force trauma are also commonly treated with surgical \nfixation for stability to reduce the risk of post -traumatic osteo arthritis. \nDiscussion of Procedures by Variant  \nVariant 1:  Acute hip pain. Fall or minor trauma. Suspect fracture. Initial imaging.  \nRadiography Hip \nRadiography is the initial imaging modality of choice for assessment of acute hip pain with suspected fracture , \nwith the more advanced imaging modalities reserved for instances of clinically suspected fracture in the setting of \nnegative or equivocal radiographs. Radiographs are rapidly obtained and well tolerated by patients. When a \nfracture is demonstrated , freque ntly no more imaging is needed for treatment planning purposes [15 -17].", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 3 Acute Hip Pain -Suspected Fracture  same study , Naqvi et al [18] did find that the cross -table lateral view changed treatment decisions in several \npatients and conceded that the cross-table lateral view remains valuable for improving overall sensitivity of \nradiographs, assessing femoral shaft extension, and assessing potentially pathologic fractures. The frog -leg view \nhas been disc ouraged in patients with suspected fractures given concern that the required patient positioning will \nlead to further fracture displacement [15,17] . One small retrospective study evaluated the benefit of an oblique AP \nview with 30 \u00b0 of lateral tube angulation to better profile the femoral neck , but this led to only a small increase in \nsensitivity and , in some cases,  resulted in obscuration of the femoral neck by the posterior wall of the acetabulum \n[19]. Thus,  standard AP and cross-table lateral views have remained  the mainstay for trauma a ssessment of the \nhip. \nMultiple studies have demonstrated that radiographs have limited sensitivity for fracture detection of the proximal \nfemur, particularly in elderly osteoporotic patients [20-24]. All of these studies constitute retrospective series in \nwhich patients with negative radiographs but high clinical suspicion went on to receive a MRI scan at the \ndiscretion of the evaluating clinician. In one such study, 14% of patients with negative rad iographs were found to \nhave fractures of the hip or pelvis  [23]. In this same study, Kirby et al  [23] also reported 12% of patients with \nsuspicious radiographs were found to have no fracture on MRI , illustrating limitations in the specificity of \nradiographs as well. Other studies have had more dra matic results,  with Sankey et al  [25] reporting 83 of 98 \npatients to have fractures after negative radiographs, 23 of whom required operative management . The variability  \nis likely due to differing proportions of patients going on to MRI following negative radiographs in these \nretrospective studies.  However , there is no accepted clinical decision rule to guide when patients with suspected \nhip fracture should have advanced imaging after negative radiographs. A new inability to bear weight is a \nclinically suspicious finding , although the sensitivity and specificity of this is unknown  [20]. Allowing for \nvariation between studies, the estimated prev alence of occult fracture after negative radiographs has  been \nestimated  at 4% to 10% , indicating the inability of negative radiographs alone to exclude fracture [21,26] . Risk \nfactors for radiographically occult fracture in these studies included those age >65, low -force trauma,  such as a \nground-level fall , and female gender. These studies have almost exclusively included elderly patients.  There is no \nrelevant literature regarding the sensitivity and specificity of radiographs in the younger patient population,  and \nclinicians are suggested to proceed with caution.  \nRadiography Pelvis  \nThere is no specific literature  regarding the use of an AP view of the pelvis  alone  for acute hip pain following \nlow-force trauma.  Previous literature regarding the accuracy of radiography has almost exclusively evaluated AP \nand cross-table lateral radiographs of the hip or the combined use of AP pelvis and hip radiographs. However, i t is \nwell established that patients with clinically  suspected proximal femur fracture often have fractures of the pelvis,  \nincluding the sacrum and pubic rami [21,27-30] . Therefore , it has been  recommended that the radiographic series \ninclude the AP view of the pelvis along with the orthogonal  views  of the symptomatic hip [31] . The inclusion of a \npelvis radiograph also allows for comparison of potential abnormalities to the contralateral asymptomatic side.  \nPelvis radiographs share the same limitations in sensitivity  and specificity  for fracture detection as hip \nradiographs , and a negative radiograph alone cannot exclude fracture . \nRadiography Pelvis and Hip \nAs previously discussed, p atients with clinically suspected proximal femur fracture often have fractures of the \npelvis  that includ e the sacrum and pubic rami [21,27- 30]. Moreover, these pelvic fractures may occur in isolation \nor concomitant with a fracture of the proximal femur [28]."], ["ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 4 Imaging  After  Total  Knee  Arthroplasty  IMAGING  AFTER  TOTAL  KNEE  ARTHROPLASTY  \nExpert  Panel  on Musculoskeletal  Imaging:  Eric A.

In 2012,  >670,000 knee  replacement  procedures  were performed  in the United  States  [3], which  represents \nan increase of 86% since 2003  [4]. It is estimated  that 4 million  patients  in the United  States  are currently  living  \nwith a knee  replacement  [5]. By 2030,  it is estimated  that the annual  demand  for primary  TKA  will grow  by 673%  \nto 3.48 million  [6]. Factors contributing  to the rising  number  of TKAs include  population growth;  aging  and \nincreased  longevity of the population;  expanded indications  for performing  TKA,  especially  in individuals  >65 \nyears of age; obesity;  decline in postprocedure  complications;  and increased  patient  demand  [7]. \nThe patient  satisfaction  rate for TKA is relatively  high,  ranging  from  75% to 89% [8]. Around  10% to 30% of the \npatients  report  ongoing pain or are not satisfied  with the result  [9]. Factors,  which  contribute  to patient  \ndissatisfaction , include  unmet  expectations,  functional  limitations,  and postoperative  complications  including pain \n[10]. Most  TKA  patients  expe rience improved outcomes  and long implant survival,  with long-term  TKA failure  \nrates of <1% per year [5]. The growth in the number  of primary  TKA  procedures  has been  accompanied  by increased  \nrates of TKA revision  procedures  [1]. Revision  procedures  for TKAs have  increased  by 5.4 procedures  per 100,000  \npersons  per decade over the period from  1990  to 2002,  with a mean  revision  burden of 8.2%  [11]. Nearly  1.5 million  \nof those  with primary  knee  replacement  are 50 to 69 years  of age, underscoring a large population at risk for revision  \nsurgery  and long-term  complications  [5]. Sharkey  et al [12] reviewed  781 revision  TKAs and found  the most  \ncommon  failure  mechanisms  were  loosening (39.9%),  infection  (27.4%),  instability  (7.5%),  periprosthetic  fracture  \n(4.7%),  and arthrofibrosis  (4.5%) . Infection  was the most  common  reason  for early  revision  (<2 years after the \ninitial TKA) , and aseptic loosening was the most  common  reason  for late revision.  Compared  with a review  \nperformed  by the same  author  in 2002 [13], polyethylene  wear  is no longer  the major  cause  of failure , and the \npercentages of revisions  for polyethylene  wear,  instability, arthrofibrosis,  malalignment,  and extensor  mechanism  \ndeficiency  have  all decreased.", "Identifying the cause of a painful  TKA  before  surgery  is critically  important  because  \n\u201cin cases of unexplained pain,  reoperation  is unwise and frequently  associated  with suboptimal  results\u201d [14]. \nSpecial Imaging  Considerations   \nIn some  patients with knee  arthroplasties,  repeated  hemarthroses are caused  by synovial  hyperemia  or true \narteriovenous  malformations.

Of note,  patients  with keloids  have  \nincreased  odds  risk of arthrofibrosis  following primary  TKA [150] .

Palestro  et al [107,134]  described  >90% accuracy  and a specificity  with a high sensitivity  for \nWBC/marrow  studies in the assessment  of prosthet ic joints.  In the setting  of chronic  infection, differentiating  \nchronic  prosthetic  infection  from  loosening can be more  challenging,  given  that, in comparison  with acute \ninfections,  chronic  infections  tend to have  significantly  fewer  neutrophils,  which  are the predominant  type of WBC  \nlabeled  in an In-111 or Tc-99m-HMPAO WBC study,  and radiolabeled  WBCs  are predominantly  neutrophils.  A \ndecreased  WBC sensitivity  in osteomyelitis  has also been  attributed  to a bacterial  protective  membrane  or biofilm  \nand to the effect  of antibiotics  [66]. Nonetheless,  WBC/marrow  scans to include  SPECT/CT appear  to be the \nimagin g procedures  of choice,  with a high degree of accuracy  for the failed  joint prosthesis  in the setting  of a \npositive  3-phase bone  scan because a negative  WBC/marrow  study does not include  aseptic loosening [66].

Among  \nperiprosthetic  fractures,  supracondylar  distal  femur  fractures are most  common,  whereas patellar  fractures are rare \n[135,136] . Supracondylar  fractures occur  in 0.3%  to 2.5%  of TKA,  usually  within  2 to 4 years after surgery,  and \noften  occur  in the setting  of low-energy  trauma  [136] . Tibial fractures  are associated  with loose  components  and \nmalalignment.  Patellar  fractures are associated  with rheumatoid  arthritis, steroid  use, osteonecrosis,  and \nmalalignment.  Most  patients  with periprosthetic  fractures are elderly,  having poor bone  stock.  Treatment  depends", "ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 12 Imaging  After  Total  Knee  Arthroplasty  instability, polyethylene  liner wear,  and periprosthetic  fracture.  Osteolysis is a leading  cause of late TKA revision.  \nOsteolysis,  also known  as particle  disease and aggressive granulomatosis,  occurs secondary  to macrophage  \nphagocytosis  of particle  debris.  Debris originating  from  polyethylene,  cement,  and metal  can all be causes of cell-\nmediated  inflammatory  response  and osteolysis [113] , but typically  polyethylene  is the most  common  cause.  Areas \nof osteolysis contain  granulation  tissue with phagocytosed particulate  debris  [21]. The incidence of osteolysis is \nhigher  for cementless,  compared  with cemented  TKA  [114] . Osteolysis can occur  anywhere  but is more  common  \nin the region  of the femoral  condyles  near the attachment  of the collateral  ligaments,  along the periphery  of the \ncomponent,  and along  the access channels to the cancellous bone  of the tibia, including  screw holes  [114,115] . \nPatients  with osteolysis may be asymptomatic early  on but can go on to develop  pain,  swelling,  and acute synovitis.  \nAlthough small  areas of osteolysis  may be monitored,  the presence of large areas  of osteolysis suggest  component  \nloosening and may require  revision  surgery  [116] . Imaging can also help evaluate available bone  stock  in \npreparation  for revision  surgery.  Instability  refers  to abnormal  and excessive displacement  of the articular  surfaces  \nof the prosthesis  [21]. Instabil ity usually  occurs because of surgical  error and/or  poor prosthesis selection  and often  \nresults in revision  surgery  an average of 4 years after the primary  arthroplasty  [21]. Severe instability  can result  in \ndislocation. In a 2014 review of 781 cases of prosthesis failure,  Sharkey  et al [12] found that instability  represented  \nthe third  most  common  cause of prosthesis failure  overall,  accounting  for 7.5%  of all cases.  The concepts of \ninstability, malalignment, and loosening in TKA are closely  interrelated  [117] . When  malalignme nt of the joint is \ncreated  at the time of surgery,  minor  degrees of instability  can become a significant  problem.  By the same  token,  \ninstability, ongoing over time, can give rise to malalignment, which,  in turn, can lead to loosening.  Although \nligamentous  balance/imbalance plays  a role in joint instability, it is not the only factor  accounting for stability  [118] . \n3-Phase  Bone  Scan  Knee  \nThere is insufficient  evidence to support  routine  use of Tc-99m  3-phase bone  scans for the assessment  of instability.  \nBone  scintigraphy may be helpful  in diagnosing loosening,  especially  when  obtained many  years after surgery  [62]. \nThis delay  in maximum utility  is because of  the observation that positive  bone  scans are noted in 20% of \nasymptomatic knees 1 year after surge ry and in 12.5%  of individuals  2 years after surgery [61] . Serial  bone  scans \nmay be more  helpful  than a single  examination  [119] . Generally,  increased  uptake  on the delayed  images  but not \non the blood- pool phase is thought  to be due to loosening rather  than to infection  [60]. Normal  scans are most  \nhelpful  and are characterized  by a high NPV,  indicating  that loosening or infection  is unlikely.  A potential false  \nnegative ; however,  may occur  if there is loosening at the cement \u2013prosthetic  interface that does not incite  new bone  \nformation  [66].", "ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 7 Imaging  After  Total  Knee  Arthroplasty  preoperative  full-leg standing radiographs  should be performed  for patient -specific instrumentation  assisted  TKAs,  \nas a complementary  study,  to analyze the position  of the load-bearing  axis. \nRadiographs  cannot  directly  image  post-TKA periprosthetic  soft-tissue abnormalities.

The American  Academy  of Orthopaedi c Surgeons  (AAOS ) guidelines  strongly  \nrecommend  the use of ESR, CRP , and serum  interleukin -6 testing  for patients  being assessed  for periprosthetic  joint \ninfection  [54].

Factors contributing  to the rising  number  of TKAs include  population growth;  aging  and \nincreased  longevity of the population;  expanded indications  for performing  TKA,  especially  in individuals  >65 \nyears of age; obesity;  decline in postprocedure  complications;  and increased  patient  demand  [7]. \nThe patient  satisfaction  rate for TKA is relatively  high,  ranging  from  75% to 89% [8]. Around  10% to 30% of the \npatients  report  ongoing pain or are not satisfied  with the result  [9]. Factors,  which  contribute  to patient  \ndissatisfaction , include  unmet  expectations,  functional  limitations,  and postoperative  complications  including pain \n[10]. Most  TKA  patients  expe rience improved outcomes  and long implant survival,  with long-term  TKA failure  \nrates of <1% per year [5]. The growth in the number  of primary  TKA  procedures  has been  accompanied  by increased  \nrates of TKA revision  procedures  [1]. Revision  procedures  for TKAs have  increased  by 5.4 procedures  per 100,000  \npersons  per decade over the period from  1990  to 2002,  with a mean  revision  burden of 8.2%  [11]. Nearly  1.5 million  \nof those  with primary  knee  replacement  are 50 to 69 years  of age, underscoring a large population at risk for revision  \nsurgery  and long-term  complications  [5]. Sharkey  et al [12] reviewed  781 revision  TKAs and found  the most  \ncommon  failure  mechanisms  were  loosening (39.9%),  infection  (27.4%),  instability  (7.5%),  periprosthetic  fracture  \n(4.7%),  and arthrofibrosis  (4.5%) . Infection  was the most  common  reason  for early  revision  (<2 years after the \ninitial TKA) , and aseptic loosening was the most  common  reason  for late revision.  Compared  with a review  \nperformed  by the same  author  in 2002 [13], polyethylene  wear  is no longer  the major  cause  of failure , and the \npercentages of revisions  for polyethylene  wear,  instability, arthrofibrosis,  malalignment,  and extensor  mechanism  \ndeficiency  have  all decreased.", "ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 15 Imaging  After  Total  Knee  Arthroplasty  on fracture  classification,  which  often  includes  information  regarding fracture  location, degree of comminution,  and \npositio n and stability  of the prosthesis.  \n3-Phase  Bone  Scan  Knee  \nRadionuclide  3-phase bone  scans can demonstrate  increased  activity  at a site of periprosthetic  fracture  and can show  \nfractures that are radiographically occult  [137, 138].

In the setting  of chronic  infection, differentiating  \nchronic  prosthetic  infection  from  loosening can be more  challenging,  given  that, in comparison  with acute \ninfections,  chronic  infections  tend to have  significantly  fewer  neutrophils,  which  are the predominant  type of WBC  \nlabeled  in an In-111 or Tc-99m-HMPAO WBC study,  and radiolabeled  WBCs  are predominantly  neutrophils.  A \ndecreased  WBC sensitivity  in osteomyelitis  has also been  attributed  to a bacterial  protective  membrane  or biofilm  \nand to the effect  of antibiotics  [66]. Nonetheless,  WBC/marrow  scans to include  SPECT/CT appear  to be the \nimagin g procedures  of choice,  with a high degree of accuracy  for the failed  joint prosthesis  in the setting  of a \npositive  3-phase bone  scan because a negative  WBC/marrow  study does not include  aseptic loosening [66].

Among  \nperiprosthetic  fractures,  supracondylar  distal  femur  fractures are most  common,  whereas patellar  fractures are rare \n[135,136] . Supracondylar  fractures occur  in 0.3%  to 2.5%  of TKA,  usually  within  2 to 4 years after surgery,  and \noften  occur  in the setting  of low-energy  trauma  [136] . Tibial fractures  are associated  with loose  components  and \nmalalignment.  Patellar  fractures are associated  with rheumatoid  arthritis, steroid  use, osteonecrosis,  and \nmalalignment.

Weekly  repeat  aspirations may \nbe needed  if the first aspiration  is negative  and clinical suspicion  for infection  remains high.  Even  with a negative  \npreoperative  aspiration,  intraoperative  tissue may indicate  infection. Bernard  [50], after literature  review  and a \nmulticenter  trial, advocated  CRP  and joint aspiration  as the best tools  for diagnosing prosthetic  joint infection.  When  \nthe CRP  level  is >10 mg/L, repeat  joint aspiration  or biopsy is suggested.  Della  Valle  [90] also found the \ncombination of ESR and CRP  to be a good screening  tool for infection,  with only one infected  knee  having negative  \nresults on both tests.  These authors  suggest  preoperative  aspiration  if the ESR or CRP  is elevated  or if clinical  \nsuspicion  is high,  combined with intraoperative  frozen  section  analysis of the periprosthetic  synovial  tissue [90]. \nThe AAOS  gives  a moderate strength  of recommendation  for synovial  fluid  testing  including  leukocyte  count  and \nneutrophil  percentage,  aerobic and anaerobic bacterial  cultures,  leukocyte  esterase,  alpha -defensin,  CRP,  and \nnucleic acid amplification  testing  (eg, polymerase chain  reaction ) for bacteria  [54]. A recent  manuscript  advises  \nintraoperative  synovial  fluid  re-cultures are necessary  even  if the preoperative  aspiration  culture  is positive  and any \ndiscordance between  preoperative aspiration  culture  and intraoperative  synovial  fluid  culture  should be noted [91]. \nIf the joint aspirate culture  is positive  on the basis of both cell count  with differential  and positive  cultures,  then \ninfection  is considered  likely  and treatment  is initiated  [54,92] . In that setting, no further imaging  is supported for \nthe diagnostic  workup of the infection. Berbari  [46] studied  897 cases  of periprosthetic  joint infection  and found  \nthat approximately 7% were associated  with negative  cultures.  If the preoperative  synovial  cultures remain  negative,  \nmultiple  intraoperative  periprosthetic  tissues should be submitted  for aerobic and anaerobic bacterial  culture  [54]. \nMRI Knee  Without  and With  IV Contrast  \nMRI may have  a role in the workup  of periprosthetic  infection. Advances in metal  artifact  reduction may expand \nthe potential role of MRI.  Using  metal  reduction techniques,  Potter  and Foo found that infected  synovium  has \nhyperintense  laminar  appearance,  distinct from  the appearance of particle  disease [22,93] . They  noted  that, in \nselected  cases,  MRI may be helpful  in detecting  extracapsular  spread  of infection  and abscess formation.  IV contrast  \nmay provide  additional  benefit  in this regard  [93]. On the basis of their findings,  Plodkowski  [94] examined  28 \npatients  with proven infected  TKAs and 28 controls  with noninfected  TKA.  They  found  a sensitivity  of 86% to 92% \nand a specificity  of 85% to 87%,  with almost  perfect  interobserver  agreement,  when  using  the appearance of \nlamellated  hyperintense  synovitis  to classify  infected  versus noninfected  TKA.  Li [95] also reported  a different  \nlamellated  and hyperintense  appearance of the synovium  in infected  joints, which  can be differentiated  from  frond -\nlike and hypertrophied synovium  associated  with particle -induced synovitis  and from  homogeneous  fluid -signal  \nintensity  effusion  associated  with a nonspecific  synovitis."], ["Anteroposterior,  lateral  (frog -leg lateral  for hip), and oblique  (eg, ankle/knee)  \nviews are recommended to exclude  subchondral  collapse in cases of epiphyseal  osteonecrosis  [27,28] . In late-stage  \nosteonecrosis,  radiography will also show  findings  of secondary  osteoarthritis. \nBone  Scan  Area  of Interest  \nIn recent  years,  bone  scintigraphy has been  replaced  by MRI for detection  of osteonecrosis because of  poor spatial  \nresolution,  low specificity,  and the inability  to quantify size of the necrotic lesion  [29]. Single -photon emission  CT \n(SPECT) was shown  to improve  accuracy  of bone  scintigraphy  in a small  group of posttransplant  patients  [30], but \nradionucleotide  scintigraphy  is not commonly  performed  for detection  of osteonecrosis.  Early  limited  data for \nPET/ CT have not been  shown  to useful  in diagnosis  of early  osteonecrosis [31].

Preoperative  CT, before  total hip arthroplasty , showed  that 21% of femoral  head  \nosteonecrosis  staged  as ARCO  stage I or II on radiographs  to actually be stage III on CT [49]. With  developing  \ntechnologies  in 3-D printing,  CT also plays an important  role.

When  \nfemoral  head  necrotic volume  is >30%,  femoral  head  progressed  to collapse in 46% to 83% of cases,  whereas \nfemoral  heads with <30% necrotic volume  progressed  to collapse in <5% of cases [13]. Sagittal view has been  \nshown  to be important  in detection  of articular  collapse on MRI [52]. Similarly,  the volume  of necrotic volume  in \nthe humeral  head  (most  often  found in the superior  medial  aspect)  was measured  as the necrotic  angle  on the mid-\ncoronal  plane.

The inherent  decreased  spatial  resolution  \nof MRI  compared  with CT raises  doubts  about  the ability  to identify  small  pulmonary  metastases  with FDG -\nPET/MR I as accurately  as CT. MRI of the lungs  relies  heavily  on the ability  to minimize  respiratory  motion.  \nRadiography  Chest  \nChest  radiography  is less sensitive  than CT chest  imaging  for the detection  of pulmonary  nodules.  Whooley  et al \n[57] found  that 83% of asymptomatic  metastases  were  detected  radiographically  with a positive  predictive  value  of \n92% and a negative  predictive  value  of 97%.  However,  the detection  of more  and smaller  pulmonary  metastases  \nwith CT versus  radiography  has definitely  not improved  survival  rates.  Although  radiography  is less sensitive  for \ndetection  of lung metastases,  how that correlates  with clinically  significant  metastases  is less certain.  \nVariant  4: Malignant  or aggressive  primary  bone  tumor.

Local  recurrence  rates  of bone  sarcomas  are reported  to be approximately  10% to 15% \nin patients  with osteosarcoma  and Ewing  sarcoma  [58-61]. Prognosis  is poor for locally  recurrent  malignant  or \naggressive  bone  tumors,  with postrecurrence  5-year survival  rates  reported  approximately  15% to 30% in patients  \nwith osteosarcoma  and 5% in patients  with Ewing  sarcoma  [60,62] . Factors  associated  with poorer  prognosis  in \npatients  with osteosarcoma  were  size of local  recurrence  (>5 cm) and presence  of distant  metastasis  [60]. \nRecommendations  for local  recurrence  surveillance  imaging  vary amongst  expert  guidelines,  although  all \nacknowledge  the benefit  of clinical  evaluation.  Locally  recurrent  bone  tumors  can often  present  as a soft tissue  \nmass,  and in a study  of osteosarcoma  local  recurrences,  the majority  (approximately  75%)  were  soft tissue  masses  \nrather  than bone  lesions  [60]. Some  guidelines  recommend  clinical  exam ination  to be performed  solely , whereas  \nothers  recommend  in combination  with imaging  [49,51,52,63] . Time  to recurrence  also varies  with tumor  histology.  \nMost  osteosarcoma  local  recurrences  have  been  shown  to occur  within  5 years  of resection.  However,  late \nrecurrence  of both osteosarcoma  and Ewing  sarcoma  have  been  reported  [60,61] . In a study  of locally  recurrent  \nosteosarcoma,  survival  rates  decreased  from  30% at 5 years  to 13% at 10 years,  suggesting  long-term follow -up \nbeyond  5 years  is beneficial.

There  are mixed  conclusions  when  comparing  FDG -PET/CT  versus  MRI  \nwhole  body  in detecting  osseous  metastases  in general  oncology  populations  [32-34]. In a small  study  of 20 patients  \nwith Ewing  sarcoma  comparing  FDG -PET/CT  with MRI  whole  body , a single  patient  had a false -positive  bone  \nfinding  on FDG -PET/CT.

A prospective  randomized  trial of 500 patients  with resected  extremity  bone  and soft \ntissue  sarcomas  without  baseline  metastases  showed  noninferiority  of chest  radiography  compared  with CT chest  \nwith similar  overall  survival  (56%  versus  53% respectively)  and recurrence -free survival  (59%  versus  54% \nrespectively)  when  used for lung surveillance  [53,54] . \nFDG -PET/CT  Whole  Body  \nAlthough  FDG -PET/CT  is not as sensitive  for detecting  pulmonary  metastases  as CT chest  imaging,  it has been  \nshown  to be more  specific  and therefore  may be useful  as a problem -solving  tool when  an indeterminate  pulmonary  \nnodule  is detected  on diagnostic  chest  CT.

The next best imaging examination is not always clearly defined \nbecause the choice will be influenced by the radiographic appearance of the lesion, location , number of lesions, \navailability of imaging equipment, plan for biopsy/treatment , as well as underlying patient -specific clinical \nparameters.  \nCT Area of Interest  \nCT continues to play a role in the evaluation of indeterminate bone l esions discovered on radiographs, particularly \nin lesions with mineralized matrix or in suspected cases of osteoid osteoma (see Variant 4). Both MRI and CT \nhave been used to evaluate the degree of cortical involvement in chondroid lesions [ 20]. In comparison with \nradiographs and MRI, CT has been shown to better delineate the presence of cortical destruction and the character \nof matrix mineralizatio n patterns in patients with clear cell chondrosarcoma [21]. In a retrospective review of 40 \npathologically confirmed telangiectatic osteosarcomas, Murph ey et al [ 22] noted that CT was the optimal imaging \nmodality for demonstration of subtle matrix mineralization seen in 85% of cases in the intraosseous or soft -tissue \ncomponents of the lesion. Not all studies conclude that one modality, CT or MRI, is better than the ot her. A multi-\ninstitutional collaborative study assessing the relative accuracy of CT and MRI in the local staging of primary \nmalignant musculoskeletal neoplasms showed no statistically significant difference between CT and MRI in \ndetermining tumor involvem ent of muscle, bone, joints, or neurovascular structures. Further more , the combined \ninterpretation of CT and MRI did not significantly improve accuracy [ 23]. Advanced CT techniques, such as dual -\nenergy CT, have shown promise in differentiating malignant from nonmalignant tumors, although further research \nin this area is needed [ 24]. MRI is generally considered the preferred imaging modal ity for staging of bone \ntumors. Some cases may benefit from both MRI and CT because these modalities provide  comple mentary \ninformation regarding soft -tissue (often better evaluated on MR I) and matrix mineralization (often better \nevaluated on CT).  \nThere is no relevant literature regarding the specific use of CT with IV contrast or CT without and with IV \ncontrast in the evaluation of suspected primary bone tumor with radiographs indeterminate for malignancy.  \nHowever, if contrast is given, CT without and with IV contrast is preferred because it allows differentiati on of \nareas of contrast enhancement from areas of osseous matrix production . \nFDG -PET/CT Whole Body  \nFDG-PET has proven useful for further characterizing indeterminate bone tumors identified on radiogra phs.

However, an important age-related risk factor for spinal fracture presenting as LBP  is osteoporosis.  As \nbone mass decreases slowly over time, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age, and differs by sex, race, \nethnicity  [10], and comorbidities. In line with the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations for patients  \nages 65 and older being screened for osteoporosis, patients  >65 years of age may be considered at risk for \nosteoporotic fracture when presenting with LBP . \nAdditionally,  for those  patients without  neurologic  compromise  and who present  with minor  risk factors for cancer,  \ninflammatory  back  disease  (eg, ankylosing spondylitis), vertebral  compression  fracture,  or symptomatic  spinal  \nstenosis,  imaging  should be considered  after a trial of therapy  [4]. \nIn the majority  of patients, no specific pathology for LBP can be identified. Also,  studies have  shown  imaging  \nabnormalities  in a substantial  number  of people  without back  pain [11-13].

If an inflammatory  etiology  is \nsuspected  as the cause of LBP, such as ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic  spondylitis, reactive arthritis, or \ninflammatory  bowel  disease\u2013 related  spine  disorders,  please see the ACR  Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae topic  on \n\u201cInflammatory Back Pain: Known or Suspected Axial Spondyloarthropathy \u201d [14]. \nInitial Imaging  Definition \nInitial imaging  is defined  as imaging  at the beginning of the care episode for the medical  condition defined  by the \nvariant.", "One study found no \nstatistically  significant  difference in primary  outcome  after 1 year for patients  \u226565 years of age  who had spine  \nimaging  within  6 weeks after an initial visit for care for LBP versus  similar  patients who did not undergo early  \nimaging  [9].

Upright  radiographs  provide  \nuseful  functional  information  about  axial  loading.  Flexion  and extension  views can be performed  to evaluate for \nspine  stability.

Initial imaging.  \nA systematic review examining studies that used red flags  as an indication  for screening  found  that of all the red \nflags,  only a history  of cancer  has been  shown  to increase  the probability  of finding spinal  malignancy  [61]. In a \npatient  suspected  of having cancer,  MRI without  and with IV contrast  is considered  superior  in evaluation  of \nlocalizing  disease (intramedullary, intradural -extramedullary,  and extradural)  as well as assessing  extent  of the \nlesion.  For malignant/metastatic  disease,  both bony/marrow  involvement  and neural  compression  from  epidural  \ntumor  are visualized  with high spatial  resolution  [62]. Although CT lumbar  spine  without  IV contrast  can be \nperformed  to evaluate osseous  integrity  (eg, pathologic  fracture)  when  involved with tumor,  intradural  and spinal  \ncord pathologies  are poorly  depicted  on CT. Bone  scan remains invaluable  when  a survey  of the entire  skeleton  is \nindicated  (eg, for metastatic disease) ; however , MRI offers  greater  specificity  than bone  scan,  with comparable  \nsensitivity  and the added  advantage  of providing  anatomic detail  [63]. Although  osseous destruction , as well as \nidentifying  lytic or sclerotic lesions can be detected  on radiography,  at least half of the bone must  be eroded  before  \nthere is a noticeable change on radiographs  [64]. Whole -body  FDG-PET/CT  is typically  not an initial imaging  study  \nbut can be used to evaluate for widespread  metastatic disease and can distinguish  benign versus malignant  \ncompression  fractures [65,66] . \nIn a patient  with suspected  spinal  infection, MRI without  and with IV contrast  is preferred  because of its  high \nsensitivity  and specificity.  MRI can localize the site of infection  and assess the extent  of extradural/epidural  and \nparavertebral  involvement.  The addition  of IV contrast  with fat suppression  is invaluable  in identifying  epidural  \nand paraspinal  abscess [65] and helps  distinguish  abscess from  phlegmon [67].

It is the fifth most  common  reason  \nfor a physician  visit in the United  States  and accounts for approximately  3% of visits  to the emergency  department  \n[2]. \nThe American  College  of Physicians and the American  Pain Society  classify  LBP into the following  broad  \ncategories:  nonspecific LBP, back  pain potentially  associated  with radiculopathy or spinal  stenosis,  and back  pain \npotentially  associated  with another  specific spinal  cause [3]. Additionally,  guidelines  from  the American  College  \nof Physicians and the American  Pain Society  [3,4]  emphasize a focused  history  and physical  examination,  \nreassurance,  initial pain management  medications if necessary,  and consideration  of physical  therapies without  \nroutine  imaging  in patients  with nonspecific  LBP. Duration  of symptoms  also helps  guide  treatment  algorithms  in \npatients  with acute,  subacute,  or chronic  LBP. Additionally, assessment  of psychosocial  risk factors when  obtaining  \npatient  history  is a strong predictor  of patients  who are predisposed  to developing chronic  disabling LBP problems  \n[3]. \nAlthough there  is great  variability  in the definition  of acute and subacute  LBP, for the purposes  of this guideline,  \nwe will use the Institute  for Clinical Systems  Improvement  definitions  of 0 to 4 weeks to define  acute LBP,  4 to 12 \nweeks for subacute LBP, and >12 weeks for chronic  LBP [5]. \nIt is clear  that uncomplicated  acute  LBP and/or  radiculopathy is a benign,  self-limited  condition  that does not \nwarrant  any imaging studies [4,6,7] . Imaging is considered  in those  patients who have  had up to 6 weeks of medical  \nmanagement  and physical  therapy  that resulted  in little or no improvement  in their back  pain.  It is also considered  \nfor those  patients  presenting  with red flags , raising  suspicion  for a serious underlying  condition,  such as cauda \nequina  syndrome  (CES),  malignancy,  fracture,  or infection  (see Table 1). \n \naUniversity of Utah Health, Salt Lake City, Utah. bResearch Author, University of Utah Medical Center, Salt Lake City, Utah. cPanel Chair, University of \nUtah, Salt Lake City, Utah. dPanel Vice- Chair, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Saint Louis, Missouri. eUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, \nPennsylvania. fThe Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio. gMontefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.", "Back  pain with or without  radicular  symptoms,  weakness in the lower  limbs, sensory  \nchanges or numbness  in the lower  limbs,  or absent  lower  limb reflexes are other  symptoms  that have  been  described  \n[38].

Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and \nit can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain \nwith the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. \nTypically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain \npersists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  \nimaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated \nthat approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the \nprior year) radiographs [2 ]. \nThis document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  \u22655 years of age.  The \nvariants discussed include: (1) initial exam ination ; (2) initial radiograph is normal or demonstrates a joint \neffusion; (3) initial radiogr aph demonstrates osteochondritis dissecans (OCD), loose bodies or history of cartilage,  \nor meniscal repair; (4) initial radiograph demonstrates osteoarthritis or chondrocalcinosis; and (5)  initial \nradiograph demonstrates signs of prior (chronic) knee injur y (ie, Segond fract ure, tibial spine avulsion, etc ).  \nTo evaluat e knee pain associated with other conditions, please refer to the following ACR Appropriateness \nCriteria\u00ae topic on:  \u201cOsteonecrosi s of the Hip \u201d [3] for osteonecrosis,  \u201cAcute Trauma to the Knee \u201d for acute knee \ninjuries  [4], \u201cImaging After Total Knee Arthroplasty \u201d for patients with total knee arthroplasty  [5], \u201cSoft-Tissue \nMasses \u201d for a patient with a suspected soft -tissue mass [6], \u201cPrimary Bone Tumors \u201d for a patient with a suspected \nor known bone tumor [ 7], and \u201c Chronic Extremity Joint Pain -Suspected Inflammatory Arthritis \u201d for patient with \nsuspected arthritis  or synovitis [ 8]. \nSpecial Imaging  Considerations  \nKnee radiographs  should include at least one frontal projection of one or both knees (anteroposterior, Rosenberg, \nor tunnel), a tangential patellar view , and a lateral view of the affected knee [2,9].

CT kne e without IV contrast may also be useful to \nconfirm a prior osseous injury.  \nCT with IV contrast is not usually indicated to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  \nCT without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated to eva luate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous \nknee injury.  \nCT Arthrography  Knee  \nCT arthrography may be used to evaluate the menisci, articular cartilage, and the presence of loose bodies with \nreported sensitivities and specificities ranging from 86 % to 100%  [16,62-64 ]. \nMRI Knee  \nMRI without IV contrast may be indicated when radiographs demonstrate a small osseous fragment along the \nmedial patellar margin or if there is a clinical concern for prior or chronic patellar dislocation -relocation.  MRI can \nassess the integrity of the medial patellofemoral ligament and medial patellar retinaculum, define the extent of \ncartilage injury, and identify loose bodies [41].  MRI is useful for evaluating Osgood-Schlatter or Sinding -Larsen -\nJohansson syndrome [41].  If the radiograph suggests prior anterior cruciate ligament  injury, MRI can effectively \nevaluate the menisci , but evaluation for associated cartilage lesions is less useful [65].  \nMRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) \nosseous knee injury.  \nMR Arthrography  Knee  \nMR arthrography is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with s igns of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  \nUS Knee  \nUS is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  \nBone Scan Knee  \nRadionuclide bone scan is usually not indicated to evaluate patients with signs of prior  (chronic) osseous knee \ninjury.  \nImage -Guided Aspiration Knee  \nJoint aspiration is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  \nSummary of Recommendations  \n\u2022 Variant 1:  Radiographs  of the knee  are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of  chronic knee pain in \npatients greater than or equal to 5 years of age.  \n\u2022 Variant 2:  MRI knee without  IV contrast is usually appropriate in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of \nage with chronic knee pain when initial knee  radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion.  \n\u2022 Variant 3:  MRI knee without  IV contrast is usually appropriate  in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of \nage with chronic knee pain when initial knee radiographs demonstrate OCD,  loose bodies, or history of \ncartilage or meniscal repair.  \n\u2022 Variant 4:  (1) MRI knee without IV contrast  or (2)  knee aspiration or (3)  CT knee without  IV contrast may \nbe appropriate  in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of age with chronic knee pain when initial \nradiographs de monstrate degenerative changes or chondrocalcinosis.

Because there is a w ide range of radiation exposures associated with \ndifferent diagnostic procedures, a relative radiation level (RRL) indication has been included for each imaging examination. The RRLs are based on effective dose, which is a radiation dose quantity that is u sed to estimate \npopulation total radiation risk associated with an imaging procedure. Patients in the pediatric age group are at \ninherently higher risk from exposure, both because of organ sensitivity and longer life expectancy (relevant to the \nlong latenc y that appears to accompany radiation exposure). For these reasons, the RRL dose estimate ranges for \npediatric examinations are lower as compared to those specified for adults (see Table below). Additional \ninformation regarding radiation dose assessment for imaging examinations can be found in the ACR \nAppropriateness Criteria\n\u00ae Radiation Dose Assessment Introduction  document  [66].", "Additionally , in any case scenario,  the physician\u2019s judgment  and common  sense should supersede clinical  guidelines  \n[3]. \nBone  Scan  with  SPECT  or SPECT/CT  Knee  \nIn patients  with significant  acute knee  trauma  with suspected/possible dislocation , Tc-99m  bone  scan with \nSPECT/CT is not routinely  used as the initial imaging  study.  \nUS Knee  \nIn patients  with significant  acute knee  trauma  with suspected  or possible  dislocation , US is not routinely  used as \nthe initial imaging  study.  \nSummary  of Recommendations \n\u2022 Variant  1: Knee radiographs  may be appropriate  for the initial imaging  of patients  5 years of age or older  for \nthe evaluation  of a fall or acute twisting  trauma  to the knee  when  there is no focal  tenderness,  no effusion,  and \nthey are able to walk .", "ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 13 Acute  Trauma  to the Knee  \u2022 Variant  2: Knee radiographs  are usually  appropriate  as the initial imaging study  of patients  5 years of age or \nolder  for the evaluation  of a fall or acute twisting  trauma  to the knee  when  at least one of the following  is \npresent:  focal  tenderness,  effusion,  inability  to bear weight.  \n\u2022 Variant  3: MRI knee  without  IV contrast  is usually  appropriate  as the next imaging study , after radiographs  \ndid not show  fracture , of adults  or skeletally  mature  children , for the evaluation  of suspected  occult  knee  \nfractures or internal  derangement  after a fall or acute  twisting  trauma  to the knee.  \n\u2022 Variant  4: MRI knee  without  IV contrast  is usually  appropriate  as the next imaging  study  after radiographs  did \nnot show  fracture , of skeletally  immature  children,  for the evaluation  of suspected  occult  knee  fractures  or \ninternal  derangement  after a fall or acute  twisting  trauma  to the knee.  \n\u2022 Variant  5: MRI knee  without  IV contrast  or CT knee  without  IV contrast  is usually  appropriate  as the next \nimaging study  after radiographic  diagnosis  of tibial plateau  fracture,  of patients  5 years of age or older,  to \nevaluate for the suspicion  of additional  bone  or soft-tissue injury  after a fall or acute twisting  trauma  to the \nknee.

This pain may be the result of either fracture (the clavicle, scapula, or proximal humerus) or soft -tissue \ninjury (most commonly of the rotator cuff, acromioclavicular ligaments, or labroligamentous complex). The \nincidence of traumatic shoulder injuries is difficult to determine because some injury types, such as low-grade \nacromioclavicular separations or acute rotator cuff tears, are likely under -reported because patients  do not seek \nimmediate medical treatment. However, as with many traumatic injuries, traumatic shoulder pain tends to \ndisproportionately involve young adults and male patients [ 1,2]. \nThe etiology of traumatic shoulder pain can often be made based on clinical examination, radiographs, and \nmechanism of injury. Traumatic shoulder injuries can generally be separated into in juries requiring acute surgical \nmanagement and injuries in which conservative management can be attempted prior to considering surgical \ntreatment. Unstable or significantly displaced fractures and joint instability are injuries most likely requiring acute \nsurgical treatment. Most soft -tissue injuries (such as labral tears and rotator cuff tears) can undergo a period of \nconservative management prior to considering surgery. However, in addition to the specific imaging findings \nrelated to a traumatic injury, indications and timing of surgical treatment of many traumatic shoulder injuries are \ndependent on patient age, comorbidities, current activity level, and expected activity level.  \nImaging of chronic shoulder pain is beyond the scope of this topic  and is cove red in the  ACR Appropriateness \nCriteria\u00ae on \u201cShoulder Pain\u2013 Atraumatic \u201d [3]. \nDiscussion o f Procedures  by Variant  \nVariant 1:  Traumatic shoulder pain.

They can delineate \nshoulder malalignment and most shoulder fractures [ 4,5]. A standard set of shoulder radiographs for trauma \nshould include at least three  views: anterior -posterior (AP) views in internal and external rotation and an axillary \nor scapula-Y view. Axillary or scapula-Y views are vital in evaluating traumatic shoulder injuries as \nacromioclavicular and glenohumeral dislocations can be misclassified on AP  views [6,7]. Radiographs provide \ngood delineation of bony anatomy to assess for fracture and appropriate shoulder alignment, which are the two \nprimary concerns in management of acute traumatic shoulder pain.

Additional views, such as \nthe Bernageau view, have been sho wn to be effective in demonstrating the degree of bone loss of the glenoid or \nhumeral head [ 8]. \nCT Shoulder  \nComputed tomography ( CT) is better able than radiogr aphs to characteriz e fracture patterns [ 9-11].", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 8 Shoulder Pain \u2013Traumatic  Variant 2: Traumatic shoulder pain. Nonlocalized shoulder pain. Negative radiographs . Next imaging \nstudy. \nAppropriately positioned  radiographs can exclude shoulder dislocation and most displaced fractures as the \netiology for post -traumatic shoulder pain. In the setting of normal shoulder radiographs, the most common causes \nof post -traumatic shoulder pain are soft -tissue injuries such  as rotator cuff and labral tears.  \nMRI Shoulder  \nNoncontrast MRI is a reasonable imaging study in the setting of acute nonlocalized traumatic shoulder pain and \nnoncontributory radiographs. In the acute trauma setting, noncontrast MRI may be preferred to MR arthrography , \nas acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint effusion for assessment of intra -articular \nsoft-tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic \npathology such as capsular and ligament tears [34,35]. MRI is also sensitive for diagnosing bone marrow \ncontusion and has  been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries in pediatric patients [ 36,37]. \nMR Arthrography  Shoulder  \nMR arthrography has been found to be superior to noncontrast MRI in the diagnosis of labroligamentous and \npartial -thickness rotator cuff tears [17,19]. In the acute trauma setting, however, noncontrast MRI may be \npreferred to MR arthrography because acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint \neffusion for assessment of intra-arti cular soft -tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing \nextra-articular soft -tissue traumatic pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [ 34,35]. MRI is also sensitive \nfor diagnosing bone marrow contusion and has been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries \nin pediatric patients [ 36,37]. \nUS Shoulder  \nUS has limited usefulness in patients with traumatic shoulder pain that cannot be localized to the rotator cuff or \nbiceps tendon. I n the post -traumatic setting, US has been shown to detect abnormalities, including proximal \nhumeral fractures [25]; however, recent studies on US performed for non specific shoulder pain have had \nconflicting results. US  for persistent shoulder pain after trauma has been found to diagnose significant pathology, \nprimarily fractures and rotator cuff tears, in 90% of patients [ 25]. However, 40% of patients presenting with \nnonspecific shoulder pain were found to have no significant pathology on US [38]. Additionally,  US has been \ndemonstrated to be inferior to MRI in assessment of labroligamentous, osseous, and rotator cuff pathology [ 17]. \nUS can b e considered as a screening tool in patients with persistent nonspecific shoulder pain after trauma, \nparticularly in an older patient population in whom rotator cuff tears are more common. However, a low threshold \nshould be maintained for performing additi onal imaging in the setting of a noncontributory shoulder US  \nexam ination . \nCT Shoulder  \nCT has virtually no usefulness in diagnosing common traumatic soft -tissue injuries such as rotator cuff tears, \nlabroligamentous injuries, and muscle tears. Although CT is  the gold standard for diagnosing and characterizing \nfractures, MRI has been shown to be equivalent to CT in diagnosing the nondisplaced fractures that are typically \nmissed on radiographs.  \nCT Arthrography  Shoulder  \nCT is inferior to MRI and US  in diagnosing virtually all extra -articular traumatic soft -tissues injuries. CT is \nconsidered the gold standard in identifying fractures . However, MRI has shown to be equivalent to CT in \nassessing bone loss [12,18], and MRI is usually adequate for diagnosing the nondisplaced fractures that are \ntypically missed on conventional radiographs. CT arthrography is able to reliably evaluat e for glenohumeral \ncartilage injury, SLAP tears, and labroligamentous injuries [ 12,39] but is generally considered inferior to MRI in \ndiagnosing  rotator cuff and soft -tissue Bankart lesions [ 12].", "However, this is not common \npractice, and US has been shown to be inferior to MRI in diagnosing the common structural abnormalities \nassociated with shoulder instability, such as labroligamentous injuries, Hill -Sachs lesions, and partial rotator cuff \ntears [17]. \nFDG -PET/CT  Skull Base to Mid-Thigh \nThere is no role for FDG-PET/CT  in assessment of shoulder instability . \nBone Scan  Shoulder  \nThere is no role for bone scintigraphy in assessment of shoulder instability . \nVariant 7: Traumatic shoulder pain.

In \ngeneral, US can have high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of full -thickness rotator cuff tears [ 70-72] . \nThere is conflicting evidence on the ability of US  to diagnose partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [17,22,24,44,72]. \nSimilarly, although interobserver agreement in detection of full -thickness rotator cuff tears can be high, it is much \nmore variable for detection of partial -thickness tears [73,74]. \nFDG -PET/CT  Skull Base to Mid-Thigh \nFDG-PET/CT is not routinely used  for describing  rotator cuff tears.  Indirect identification of symptomatic rotator \ncuff tears has been described on FDG-PET/CT  by decreased radiotracer activity in the muscles of the torn tendons \nand increased activity of surrounding shoulder girdle muscles due to muscle recruitment  [28,29]. However, FDG-\nPET/CT  cannot describe the extent of rotator cuff tear or degree of rotator cuff atrophy, which are relevant for \nclinical management.  \nBone Scan  Shoulder  \nBone scintigraphy is not routinely used  for describing rotator cuff tears . Increased radiotracer activity has been \nassociated with symptomatic rotator cuff tears [33]. However, bone scintigraphy cannot describe the extent of \nrotator cuff tear or degree of rotator cuff atrophy, which are re levant for clinical management.  \nVariant 9: Traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs already performed.  Physical examination consistent with \nvascular compromise.  Next imaging study. \nThe subclavian, axillary, and brachial arteries are uncommonly injured followin g fractures and dislocations about \nthe shoulder; however, the consequences can be debilitating. Of these, the axillary artery is more likely to be \ninjured in patients with proximal humeral fractures, and the risk increases in the presence of open fractures, \nshoulder dislocation, and fractures of the scapula and ribs [ 75]. No systematic or comparative data is available on \ndetection of arterial injuries  in the post -traumatic setting.  \nCT Shoulder  \nNoncontrast CT may be able to demonstrate hematomas; however, it is not an adequate modality for evaluation of \nacute arterial compromise.  Contrast -enhanced CT using intravenous (IV) contrast can identify some vascular \ninjurie s. However, contrast bolus timing and image reformatting using routine contrast -enhanced CT protocols is \nsuboptimal for identifying and characterizing vascular injuries.  \nCTA Shoulder  \nCT angiography (CTA) is a specialized protocol for contrast -enhanced CT i n which image acquisition occurs \nduring maximum arterial opacification by IV contrast. Thin -slice axial images of the region of interest is \nperformed , which helps in detection of subtle vascular injuries. M aximum intensity projection (MIP) images in \nmultip le planes are also commonly performed, allowing for long segments of vessels to be visualized on a single \nimage . CTA is the preferred examination for evaluation of suspected arterial injury. It can delineate the extent of \ninjury and has the added benefit of providing optimal assessment of osseous injuries  [76,77]. \nMRI Shoulder  \nBecause of  the length of time required for MRI, it is not the modality of choice for asses sment of acute arterial \ninjury.  Both routine noncontrast and contrast -enhanced MRI protocols lack the spatial and temporal resolution as \nwell as imaging plane orientation to identify and characterize most arterial injuries . \nMRA Shoulder  \nMR angiography (MRA) is MR imaging tailored to evaluate for arterial compromise using sequences such as \ntime-of-flight, phase -contrast, and dynamic postcontrast imaging.  MRA can produce 2D images or dynamic 3D \nimages of the arteries that simulates arteriography.  However, the special resolution of MRA is inferior to CTA \nand arteriography.", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 11 Shoulder Pain \u2013Traumatic  Variant 5: Traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs show Bankart  or Hill-Sachs lesion. Next imaging  study. \nBankart and Hill -Sachs lesions are common findings associated with transient shoulder dislocation. Bankart \nlesions have a particularly high association with transient shoulder dislocations [50], and a transient shoulder \ndislocation should be presumed if a Bankart lesion is present. A close association exists bet ween Bankart and \nHill-Sachs lesions [ 51], and one should be sought out whenever the other is identified on radiographs. Both \nBankart and Hill -Sachs lesions can present as nonosseous  lesions that are occult on r adiographs and noncontrast \nCT. \nMRI Shoulder  \nSimilar to MR arthrography, noncontrast MRI is comparable to CT in evaluating glenoid and humeral head bone \nloss [12,18]. In general, noncontrast MRI performs well in diagnosing labroligamentous injuries [ 20,52]. \nHowever, noncontrast MRI is considered inferior to MR arthrography for assessing labroligamentous pathology \nfrequently associated with Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions [ 17,19]. Noncontrast MRI is a good alternative to MR \narthrography in the setting of acute injury when significant glenohumeral joint effusion is present to assist in \nvisualization of intra -articular soft -tissue pathology.  \nMR Arthrography  Shoulder  \nMR arthrography is the preferred study for evaluating subacute or chronic Bankart lesions because of  its soft -\ntissue contrast. Multiple studies have shown MR arthrography to be reliable in diagnosing labroligamentous \ninjuries [12,17,52] and superior to noncontrast MRI for this indication [ 17,19]. MR arthrography has been shown \nto be equivalent to CT in the assess ment of glenoid and humeral head bone loss [ 12,18], while being superior to \nCT in assessment of labroligamentous in juries [12]. MR arthrography is also able to delineate humeral head and \nglenoid cartilage, which can be important because some Hill -Sachs lesions affect  cartilage only  [11]. \nCT Shoulder  \nNoncontrast CT has historically been used to assess Hill -Sachs and bony Bankart lesions. However, MRI has \nbeen shown to be equivalent to CT for a ssessing both glenoid and humeral head bone loss [ 12,18,53], and CT is \nlimited in the assessment of cartilaginous Hill -Sachs lesions [11]. In addition, CT cannot assess injury to \nsoft-tissue structures like the labroligamentous complex, which further limits its usefulness in evaluating Bankart \nlesions. CT should be reserved for patients with a contraindication to MRI or patients in whom MRI assessment \nof bone loss is limited.  \nCT Arthrography  Shoulder  \nCT arthrography has sho wn fair agreement between observers and is comparable to MR arthrography in \ndiagnosing Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions [ 12,13]. However, CT arthrography is inferior to MRI in diagnosing \nother soft -tissue pathology [ 12].

MR arthrogr aphy has also outperformed noncontrast MRI in diagnosis of \nrotator cuff tears [17,19], which is a common associated finding in older patients with shoulder dislocation. \nHowever, high sensitivities reported for MR arthrography in the detection of labral pathology may not be \napplicable to patients with clinically unstable shoulders. A retrospective review of 90 patients with clinically \nunstable shoulders selected for arthroscopy [ 60] found that MR arthrography had a sensitivity of 65% for \ndetection of labral  tears. The authors proposed that this discrepancy with prior studies was the result of different \npatient selection criteria (clinically unstable in their study versus less-specific symptoms such as shoulder pain in \nothers) and the interpretation of MR art hrography by experienced musculoskeletal radiologists [ 60]. For this \ndocument, it is assumed the procedure is performed and interpreted by an expert.  \nMRI Shoulder  \nMRI without contrast may be pre ferred to MR arthrography in the setting of acute shoulder dislocation when a \npost-traumatic joint effusion is present to provide sufficient visualization of soft -tissue structures. In the subacute \nor chronic setting, the glenohumeral joint effusion is usually too small to provide adequate joint distention for \noptimal assessment  of soft -tissue structures. Non contrast MRI has been shown to be inferior to MR arthrography \nin diagnosing labroligamentous and rotator cuff injuries [17,19]. Non contrast MRI performs comparably to CT in \nevaluating glenoid and humeral head bone loss [ 12,18], which may obviate the need for noncontrast CT . \nCT Arthrography  Shoulder  \nCT arthrography is effective in evaluation of shoulder instability. CT arthrogr aphy is comparable to MR \narthrography in the diagnosis of Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions [12] , and moderate agreement has been found \nbetween readers for diagnosing ant erior capsule laxity on CT arthrography. However, CT arthrography has been \nshown to be inferior to MR arthrography in assessing partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [12], which makes CT \narthrography less desirable in older patients with dislocation/instability where rotator cuff tears are common.

Bankart \nlesions have a particularly high association with transient shoulder dislocations [50], and a transient shoulder \ndislocation should be presumed if a Bankart lesion is present. A close association exists bet ween Bankart and \nHill-Sachs lesions [ 51], and one should be sought out whenever the other is identified on radiographs. Both \nBankart and Hill -Sachs lesions can present as nonosseous  lesions that are occult on r adiographs and noncontrast \nCT. \nMRI Shoulder  \nSimilar to MR arthrography, noncontrast MRI is comparable to CT in evaluating glenoid and humeral head bone \nloss [12,18]. In general, noncontrast MRI performs well in diagnosing labroligamentous injuries [ 20,52]. \nHowever, noncontrast MRI is considered inferior to MR arthrography for assessing labroligamentous pathology \nfrequently associated with Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions [ 17,19]. Noncontrast MRI is a good alternative to MR \narthrography in the setting of acute injury when significant glenohumeral joint effusion is present to assist in \nvisualization of intra -articular soft -tissue pathology.  \nMR Arthrography  Shoulder  \nMR arthrography is the preferred study for evaluating subacute or chronic Bankart lesions because of  its soft -\ntissue contrast. Multiple studies have shown MR arthrography to be reliable in diagnosing labroligamentous \ninjuries [12,17,52] and superior to noncontrast MRI for this indication [ 17,19]. MR arthrography has been shown \nto be equivalent to CT in the assess ment of glenoid and humeral head bone loss [ 12,18], while being superior to \nCT in assessment of labroligamentous in juries [12]. MR arthrography is also able to delineate humeral head and \nglenoid cartilage, which can be important because some Hill -Sachs lesions affect  cartilage only  [11]. \nCT Shoulder  \nNoncontrast CT has historically been used to assess Hill -Sachs and bony Bankart lesions. However, MRI has \nbeen shown to be equivalent to CT for a ssessing both glenoid and humeral head bone loss [ 12,18,53], and CT is \nlimited in the assessment of cartilaginous Hill -Sachs lesions [11]. In addition, CT cannot assess injury to \nsoft-tissue structures like the labroligamentous complex, which further limits its usefulness in evaluating Bankart \nlesions. CT should be reserved for patients with a contraindication to MRI or patients in whom MRI assessment \nof bone loss is limited.  \nCT Arthrography  Shoulder  \nCT arthrography has sho wn fair agreement between observers and is comparable to MR arthrography in \ndiagnosing Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions [ 12,13]. However, CT arthrography is inferior to MRI in diagnosing \nother soft -tissue pathology [ 12]. CT arthrography can be considered a reasonable imaging alterna tive in patients \nwith contraindication to MRI. \nUS Shoulder  \nThere is no role for US  in assessment of Bankart or Hill -Sachs lesions.

Although often  \nconsidered  unrewarding  by clinicians  without  musculoskeletal  expertise,  a study of the radiogra phic evaluation  of \n454 patients  with proven  soft tissue masses demonstrated  positive  results in 62% of cases,  with calcification  \nidentified  in 27% of cases,  bone  involvement  in 22% of cases,  and intrinsic  fat in 11% of cases [10]. Specifically,  \nradiographic  findings  can be diagnostic  or highly  character istic,  such as in the identification  of phleboliths  within  a \nhemangioma,  the osteocartilaginous  masses  of synovial  chondromatosis,  or the peripherally  more  mature  \nossification  of myositis  ossificans,  to name  just a few. In addition, radiographs  can be diagnostic  of an unsuspected  \nskeletal  abnormality  or deformity  that may manifest  as a soft tissue mass.  Even  when  a specific diagnosis  cannot  \nbe provided,  radiographs  may reveal  information  on the type and scope of mineralization, the presence or absence  \nof unsuspected  foreign  matter,  or changes  within  the adjacent  bone.  In general,  radiographic  findings  related  to a \nsoft tissue mass  can provide  helpful  insight  in determining  the next most  appropriate  imaging  modality  for further  \ncharacterization.  Of note,  radiographs  may not demonstrate an associated  abnormality  when  a mass  is small, deep -\nseated,  nonmineralized,  or in an area with complex  anatomy  such as the flank,  paraspinal  region,  groin,  or deep  soft \ntissues of the hands  and feet [11]. \nUS Area  of Interest  \nUltrasound  (US)  has become increasingly  recognized  as an excellent  triage  tool for evaluation  of superficial  soft \ntissue masses [12-15].

The same group  of researchers had similar  results in an earlier  separate  \nretrospective analysis of 247 histologically  proven  masses [17]. However,  although these results highlight  the \nbenefits of US in the initial assessment  of superficial  masses,  the overall  number  of malignancies in both the \nprospective  [16] and retrospective [17] studies was very small  (12 patients  and 11 patients,  respectively).  Another  \nrecent  study of 42 histologically  proven masses concluded that MRI performed  after US does not frequently change  \nthe working diagnosis  or add diagnostic  value,  but again , this study only included  a small  number  of malignancies \nand the value  of MRI for these malignancies was not separately  addressed  in the study  [18].", "ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 5 Soft Tissue  Masses CT Area of Interest  Without  and With  IV Contrast  \nCT does not typically  play a role in the initial evaluation  of a superficial  soft tissue mass.  \nCT Area of Interest  Without  IV Contrast  \nCT does not typically  play a role in the initial evaluation  of a superficial soft tissue mass.  \nFDG -PET/CT  Area  of Interest  \nThere is insufficient  literature  to support  the routine  use of fluorine -18-2 -fluoro -2-deoxy-D -glucose (FDG )-PET/CT  \nfor the initial evaluation  of a soft tissue mass.  \nImage -Guided Biopsy  Area  of Interest  \nThe l iterature  does not support  the use of image -guided biopsy as the initial examination  for a soft tissue mass.

Chang,  MD.n \nSummary  of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nA variety  of benign and malignant  processes may present  clinically  as a soft tissue  mass.  The behavior  of a mass,  \nwhether  nonaggressive,  indeterminant,  or aggressive,  can often  be discerned  based  on history  and physical  \nexamination.  However,  when  a benign clinical diagnosis  cannot  be confidently provided,  further  characterization  \nof a soft tissue mass  with imaging  is warranted  [1]. Urgent  imag ing requests should be sought  for masses  that are \n>5 cm in diameter,  deep  in location, or have  shown  rapid  growth [2]. Modern imaging  techniques  allow  for a \ndetailed  analysis of the morphology  of a soft tissue mass  as well as further insight  into its biologic  activity , which  \ninforms  the interpreter  on diagnosis  and appropriate  next steps in management  [3,4].  \nThe purpose  of this document  is to identify  the most  appropriate  imaging  study(ies)  to order  for the assessment  of \na soft tissue  mass  based  on the most  frequently encountered  clinical  scenarios in medical  practice.  The rationale for \nthe level  of appropriateness  granted  to each study  option is also described  in accordance with the current  literature  \nand the consensus opinion of the members  of the ACR  Appropriateness Criteria  Expert  Panel  on Musculoskeletal  \nImaging.  This document  does not address follow -up recommendations for patients  with previously diagnosed  \nmasses or the appropriate  approach  or techniques  for the imaging -guided biopsy of known masses.  The former is \ncovered  by a separate ACR  Appropriateness Criteria  document  [4], whereas the latter  requires direct  communication  \nwith the clinician  or orthopedic  oncologist  supervising and coordinating patient  care.  \nOf note,  soft tissue sarcomas are rare, representing  <1%  of all malignancies [5]. Therefore,  we must  emphasize  a \nfundamental  tenet  of orthopedic  oncology:  if a \u201c\u2026practitioner,  or the institution, is not equipped to perform  accurate  \ndiagnostic  studies or definitive  operative  and adjunctive  treatment  \u2026 then it is in the patient\u2019s  best interest  to be \nreferred  to a treatment  center  before  performance of the biopsy\u201d  [6,7] . This tenet  has been  recently  supported by a \nlarge retrospective  analysis  of 25,406 patients  with soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities  that found lower  risk of \npositive  margins  and mortality  in patients  treated  at high-volume  orthopedic  oncology  centers (>20 soft tissue  \nsarcoma patients  annually)  compared  with low-volume  centers [8]. \nInitial Imaging  Definition \nInitial imaging  is defined  as imaging  at the beginning of the care episode for the medical  condition defined  by the \nvariant.", "US is more  useful  to evaluate  superficial  soft \ntissue  masses  as opposed  to bone  lesions , which  are usually  occult  if there  is no cortical  breakthrough.  \nVariant  3: Malignant  or aggressive  primary  musculoskeletal  tumor  with  no suspected  or known  recurrence.  \nSurveillance  for pulmonary  metastasis.  \nPulmonary  metastases  account  for the majority  of distant  metastatic  disease  in patients  with primary  extremity  \nsarcoma  as a whole.  Risk of pulmonary  metastasis  varies  with tumor  histology  and grade.  Although  patients  with \nhigh-grade  soft tissue  sarcomas  develop  lung metastasis  at a rate of ~60%,  those  with low-grade  sarcomas  have  \nlung metastasis  rates  <10%  [45,46] . Therefore,  guidance  regarding  modality  for lung screening  often  differ  between  \nlow-risk and high-risk patients.  There  is also debate  concerning  the frequency  of lung surveillance.  Given  most  \npulmonary  metastases  will occur  within  2 years  of primary  resection  [47], many  experts  support  more  frequent  \nsurveillance  initially  in the first few years  after diagnosis.  Surveillance  regimens  usually  de-escalate  to annual  \nfollow -up after 5 years  postresection  [48-52]. Although  these dynamic  protocols  are often  used,  a prospective  \nrandomized  trial of 500 patients  with resected  extremity  sarcomas  and no baseline  metastatic  disease  found  no \ndifference  in overall  survival  or recurrence -free survival  between  groups  whether  surveilled  at 3 month  or 6-month  \nconsistent  intervals  [53,54] . Pulmonary  metastases  are associated  with a worse  prognosis  [45], and treatment  of \nthese  pulmonary  metastases  can improve  survival  [8,10] . Identification  of pulmonary  metastases  is an essential  part \nof primary  musculoskeletal  tumor  screening.  There  is little to no variation  in the ability  of a certain  modality  to \ndetect  pulmonary  metastasis  whether  performed  at initial  staging  (see Variant  1), surveillance,  or restaging  in the \nsetting  of recurrence.", "ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 7 Soft Tissue  Masses National  Comprehensive  Cancer  Network  Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for Soft Tissue Sarcoma  state \nthat biopsy  should be performed  only after adequate imaging  [24]. \nImage -Guided Fine  Needle Aspiration  Area  of Interest  \nThe l iterature  does not support  the use of image -guided fine needle aspiration  as the initial examination  for a soft \ntissue mass.

In addition, this variant presumes there are no contraindications \nto any imaging modality. Variant 4 specifically addresses the situation  of a contraindication to MRI.  \nCT Area  of Interest  With  IV Contrast  \nAlthough CT with IV contrast lacks the specificity afforded by MRI in many cases, it does provide useful staging \ndata [32]. In a multi-institutional study of 133 patients  with primary  soft tissue malignancies,  Panicek  et al [32] \nfound  no statistically  significant  difference between  MRI and contrast -enhanced  CT imaging  in determining  tumor  \ninvolvement  of muscle,  bone,  joint, or neurovascular  structures.  Therefore,  CT with IV contrast  remains an \nimportant  adjunct  in the evaluation  of a soft tissue mass.  \nThe advent  of virtual noncontrast  reconstruction  with modern dual-source CT scanners allows  for acquisition  of a \nsingle  postcontrast  scan with reconstruction  of virtual noncontrast  images,  which  can preclude  the need  for a \nseparate precontrast  scan phase [31]. Similar  to CT without  IV contrast  [21, 22], virtual noncontrast  imaging  allows \ndistinction  of ossification  from  calcification  and identification  of characteristic patterns of mineralization  [29,30]  \nand is particularly  useful  in assessment  of mass  mineralization  in areas where the osseous anatomy is complex  or \nobscured  and radiographs  would be less sensitive.  \nCT Area  of Interest  Without and With  IV Contrast  \nThe advent of virtual noncontrast reconstruction with modern dual -source CT scanners allows for acquisition of a \nsingle postcontrast scan with reconstruction of virtual noncontrast images, which can preclude the need for a \nseparate precontrast scan phase [31] .

Overall \nsensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs \nin the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral \nand oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar \ncoalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs \non the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have \nbeen found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable \nmethods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  \nRadiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review \nby Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for \nradiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.  \nRadiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  \nusually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, \nosteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite \nversus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess \nwith radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton\u2019s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other \ncauses of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg\u2019s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals \nor soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . \nThough radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in \npatients with a painful heel.

CT is considered a useful and reliable method to determine the extent of necrosis in \nFreiberg\u2019s infraction, which represents the main determining factor in the outcome [30]. There is no evidence in the \nliterature supporting the routine use of contrast -enhanced CT imaging in the diagnosis of any of the conditions \ndiscussed above.

Overall \nsensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs \nin the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral \nand oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar \ncoalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs \non the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have \nbeen found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable \nmethods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  \nRadiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review \nby Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for \nradiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.  \nRadiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  \nusually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, \nosteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite \nversus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess \nwith radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton\u2019s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other \ncauses of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg\u2019s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals \nor soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . \nThough radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in \npatients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The \ncombination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a \nspecificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15]. \nUS Foot  \nUltrasound (US) is usually not indicate d as the first imaging  study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain, but may \nbe performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of pathologic conditions of the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, \nand other conditions such as tarsal tunnel syndrome, Morton\u2019s  neuroma , plantar plate tears,  and intermetatarsal \nbursitis. \nVariant 2: Persistent posttraumatic foot pain.

The most  commonly  accepted  form  of these  \nrules is the following:  \nA series of foot radiographs  is required  only if there  is pain in the midfoot  and any one of the \nfollowing:  1) point  bone  tenderness of the navicular;  2) point  bone  tenderness of the base of the fifth \nmetatarsal;  or 3) inability  to bear weight  or to walk  4 steps (immediately  after the injury  or at the \nemergency  department) . \nA meta -analysis (10 studies  encompassing  3,725  patients)  of the Ottawa rules for the foot showed  that these rules  \nhave  a sensitivity  of 99% and a median  specificity  of 26% for combined  evaluation  of the ankle  and midfoot  [1]. \nThe Ottawa rules for the ankle  and midfoot  have  been  shown  to be effective for the pediatric  population (>5 years \nof age) [2]. Including  the added  criterion  of swelling  yields  a sensitivity  and specificit y for fracture of 100%  and \n55% for the malleolar  zone and 50% and 40% for the midfoot,  respectively  [3,4] . \nExclusionary Criteria  \nMultiple  conditions  or scenarios preclude  the use of the Ottawa rules for determining  if imaging  is necessary  \n[5,6] . It has been  reported  that the Ottawa rules  for the foot should not be used or should be used with great  \ncaution  in the following  clinical  situations:  penetrating  trauma,  pregnancy,  any skin wound,  transferred  with \nradiographs  already  taken,  >10 days after trauma,  a return  visit for continued  traumatic  foot pain,  in the setting  of \npolytrauma,  altered  sensorium,  neurologic  abnormality  affecting  the foot, or underlying  bone  disease [7]. \nOther  clinical  scenarios of foot trauma  not directly  addressed  by the Ottawa rules  include  trauma  to the metatarsal  \nheads and toes and penetrating  trauma  with concern  for a foreign  body  in the soft tissues.  Also,  there is little in the \nliterature  on medical  decision  making of when  to order  a radiographic  study  of the toes [8]. \nDiscussion  of Procedures  by Variant  \nVariant  1: Adult  or child older  than  5 years of age.

The Ottawa rules  should  not be applied  in this clinical  setting  \nbecause pain perception  may be diminished,  no point  tenderness will be elicited  with palpation,  and the patient  \nmay be able to ambulate  even  if a fracture is present  [5]. Polytrauma  and penetrating  trauma  also constitute  \nexceptions  to the implementations  of the Ottawa rules . \nBoth  radiographs  and US are useful  imaging tools  to exclude  a foreign  body in the setting  of penetrating  trauma  to \nthe foot [24]. The best initial imaging study  for a foreign  body in the foot depends  on whether  or not the suspected  \nforeign  body is radiopaque  (eg, gravel,  both leaded  and nonleaded  glass,  or metal).  Radiographic  evaluation  for a \nradiopaque  foreign body has approximately  98% sensitivity  [25]. If an unembedded fragment  of the foreign  body \nis available,  then imaging  it alongside  the foot might  provide  more  information  as to the morphology and density  \nof the foreign  body.  \nCT Foot  \nCT is commonly used in evaluating  the true extent  of osseous injury  in complex fractures and at times  is used as \nthe initial imaging  study  in polytrauma  patients  and in complex  regions  such as the midfoot  [21,22] . In the \npolytrauma  patient, approximately  25% of midfoot  fractures identified  on CT are overlooked on radiographs  [21].  \nTherefore,  CT is essential  for appropriate  treatment  planning and determining  the true extent  of osseous injuries  in \nthe polytrauma  patient  and can be used as primary  imaging  technique  in high-energy  polytrauma  patients.  \nInitial clinical  experience suggests that cone -beam  CT of the foot or ankle  of pediatric  patients  is a viable  lower -\ndose alternative  to multidetector  CT [26]. \nMRI Foot  \nMRI is not routinely  used as the first imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the foot in the setting  of \nperipheral  neuropathy,  penetrating  trauma , or polytrauma .", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 6 Chronic Foot Pain  nontumoral conditions affecting the h allucal sesamoids;  however , it could be useful to distinguish between \nsesamoiditis and avascular necrosis [32,33] . \nThe most commonly used imaging techniques in the diagnosis of Morton\u2019s  neuroma  are MRI and US.

Increased fluid within the intermetatarsal bursa, which suggest s bursitis, is well \ndemonstrated on MRI [37] . Although the use of gadolinium does not seem essential to detect Morton\u2019s  neuroma s \n[38], it may facilitate its detection  because of  the improved soft -tissue contrast [32,39] . \nMRI is widely accepted as the imaging study  of choice for diagnosis of plantar plate tears.

Other authors have found higher \ndiagnostic capabilities of US over MRI in the diagnosis of Morton\u2019s  neuroma  with pooled sensitivity, specificity, \npositive likeli hood ratio,  and negative likelihood ratio of 90%, 88%, 2.77,  and 0.16 for US and 93%, 68%, 1.89,  \nand 0.19 for MRI [47] . \nMRI is generally better , but US is also useful in the diagnosis of plantar plate tears. In a cadaveric study, an accuracy, \nsensitivity , and specificity of 79%, 78% , and 80% , respectively , were found for US [48]. With MRI as the reference \nstandard, Gregg et al [49]  showed a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV , and accuracy of 91%, 44%, 93%, 35% , and \n85%, respectively , for US in the detection of metatarsophalangeal plantar plate tears in symptomatic subjects."], ["ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 10 Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture  Variant 5: Confirmed stress (fatigue) fracture, excluding vertebrae . Follow -up imaging study for  \u201creturn -\nto-play\u201d evaluation . \nSee variants 1  through  3. On initial diagnosis, MRI can be used to  predict t ime to return to play in athletes. \nFredericson et al  [48] retrospectively correlated return to activity with an MRI grading system based on the \npattern of periosteal and marrow edema on T1-weighted  and fat -suppressed T 2-weighted sequences. Similar \nfindings were confirmed in other studies  [49-51] , including  that the finding of abnormal cortical signal intensity \nor a fracture line was of prognostic value [ 51] and that MRI performed better in predicting return to activity than \nradiographs , bone scintigraphy, or CT [50,52]. \nA recent prospective study in university athletes found that MRI grading s everity, total-body bone mineral density \nevaluated by dual -energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and location of injury (ie , cortical or trabecular bone)  \nwere important variables for predicting time to full return to sport [ 31]. In this study, periosteal edema as \ndescribed by Fredericson et al [ 48] was not associated with return to sport . Using the modified grading scale and a \nmultiple regression model, for every 1- unit increase in MRI grade, the time to full return to sport increased by \napproximately 48 days [31] . Furthermore, trabecular st ress injuries (eg , femur neck and pubic bone ) were \nassociated with a longer time to return to sport than cortical bone stress injuries. In addition, decreased bone \nmineral density leads to increased time to return to sport . Therefore, bone mineral density provides additional \ndiagnostic and prognostic information [31]. The model of MRI  grade, trabecular versus cortical bone sit e, and \ntotal-body bone mineral density a ccounted for 68% of the variation in time to return to sport [ 31]. Although \nfurther studies are needed, optimization of bone mass may reduce risk of sustaining str ess injuries or possibly \nreduce recovery time i n athletes with these injuries.  \nIt should be noted that after a diagnosis of stress fracture is made, no additional imaging is typically performed. \nPatients are typically followed clinically until they are pain  free, at which time they can  increase activity in a \ncontrolled manner  [53]. \nVariant 6 : Suspected stress (in sufficiency) fracture , pelvis or hip. First imaging study.  \nSee variant 1.  Pelvic and hip insufficiency fractures have varied presentations and often insidious onset. Patients \nfrequently present with intractable lower back or pelvic pain, with loss of mobil ity and independence  and \nsymptom exacerbation with weight bearing [54]. Insufficiency fractures occur in patients with abnormal bone , be \nit from osteoporosis, irradiated bone, or resumpt ion of activity postarthropl asty as typical examples. Insufficiency \nfractures also occur at fairly predictable sites, including the sacrum , supra -acetabular ilium, superior and inferior \npubic rami,  and pubic bone . Radiographs should be the initial imaging modality in patients with low back and/or \npelvic pain. Anterior -posterior ( AP) and lateral lumbar spine and AP pelvis radiographs are usually obtained. \nBecause of  overlying bowel gas, fecal material, vascular calcifications, sacral curvature, and/or copious soft \ntissue, the sensitivity of radiographs is low  [55]. Radiographs may be more likely to be negative initially in older \nor osteoporotic patients with insuffi ciency fractures, particularly when they occur in the pelvis or sacrum  where \nthere is more overlapping soft tissue [ 17]. However, if the findings are conclusive for insufficiency fracture, no \nfurther imaging need be performed.  \nVariant 7 : Suspected stress (insufficiency) fracture, pelvis or hip.  Negative radiographs. Next imaging \nstudy. \nNormal bone scintigraphy generally excludes a diagnosis of stress/fracture, and the patient can return to normal \nactivity.", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 9 Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture  [8]. Detection of osseous change is more limited in areas covered by prominent overlapping soft tissue [17]. If the \nosseous reaction involve s cortical bone, then endosteal/periosteal callus may be visible with or without a fracture \nline through the cortex. If the trabecular bone is involved, then stress fractures are often more  subtle, progressing \nfrom patchy areas of increased density into linear areas of sclerosis, oriented perpendicular to the trabeculae.  \nAlthough bone scans were regarded as the gold-standard examination for many years, MRI is extremely sensitive \nand demonstrates stress abnormalities as early as bone scintigraphy  and with as much sensitivity  [11-14] . The \nrecent literature favors MRI as the procedure of choice for making an early diagnosis of both varieties of stress \nfractures [15-28]. In this regard, MRI outperforms radiography,  bone scintigraphy, and CT. Furthermore, MRI \nexamination of an osseous stress injury contains  prognostic as well as diagnostic information  [30,31]. \nCT is not typically used as a first - or second -line imaging tool  but may offer an adjunctive role when other \nimaging modalities are equivocal  [23]. Although  superior to radiography, it is less sensitive than nuclear \nscintigraphy and MRI  [19]. \nStress fractures in the femur most often occur in the femoral neck and represent up to 7% of all stress fractures  \n[39]. Lateral \u201ctension -type \u201d femoral neck stress fractures are inherently unstable and prone to displacement  [40] \nand are high-risk fractures, often necessitating percutaneous screw fixation  [41]. Medial \u201ccompression -type \u201d \nfemoral n eck stress fractures are low risk [40] and can be treated with a non\u2013 weight -bearing  regimen  [42]. \nFinally, stress fractures of the femoral head are high  risk in healthy patients and , if not recognized promptly, have \nincreased  rates of delayed union, nonunion, displacement, and avascular necrosis [17]. Given the importance of \nrecognizing these high-risk fractures in the femoral head and neck, MRI is the preferred second -line study after  \ninitial negative  radiographs to prevent delayed diagnosis.  \nVariant 3: Suspected stress (fatigue) fracture, excluding hip  and vertebrae. Negative radiographs. Next \nimaging study.  \nSee variant 2. Certain stress fractures are considered high  risk based on a tendency for nonunion or delayed union. \nHigh -risk stress fractures include the anterior tibial diaphysis, lateral femoral neck and femoral head (see variant \n2), patella, medial malleolus, navicular, fifth metatarsal base, proximal second metatarsal, tibial hallux sesamoid, \nand talus  [43]. \nThe second -line test to diagnose a stress fracture should be guided by the location of the patient \u2019s pain and \nlikelihood of high-risk injury. A follow -up radiographic examination has increased sensitivity compared to initial \nradiographs [8] but is less sensitive than MRI. MRI is extremely sensitive and demonstrates stress abnormalities \nas early as bone scintigraphy and with as much sensitivity [ 11-14]. The recent literature favors MRI as the \nprocedure of choice for making an early diagnosis of both varieties of stress fractures [ 15-28 ]. MRI is also \nconsiderably more specifi c than bone scintigraphy [ 19,23]. Stress injuries in athletes that are not identified and \nmanaged in a timel y fashion can progress to more serious fractures. Preventive strategies, including identifying \nand modifying risk factors, may help deter progression to frank fractures [31,44,45]. \nA circumstance that deserves specific attention is the longitudinal stress fracture, particularly in the tibia. Up to \n25% may appear n ormal on radiographs, but CT or MRI findings are characteristic [ 13,46]. MRI is very sensitive \nto the bone marrow e dema accompanying these longitudinal fractures and may give a misleadingly aggressive \nappearance [38].", "Correlat ion of  clinical history, pattern , and site recognition \nwith radiographic findings  is usually specific [1,2,4,5,7]. Nevertheless, stress fractures are frequently occult on \ninitial radiographs  [1], with conventional radiographs having a sensitivity of 15% to 35% [8]. Early radiographic \nfindings are often nonspecific (subtle periosteal reaction , gray cortex sign) or even nonexistent. Late radiographic \nfindings are often suggestive in appearance  and include  linear sclerosis (often perpe ndicular to the major \ntrabecular lines), periosteal reaction , patchy endosteal sclerosis, and soft -tissue swelling . Additionally, \nradiographs may remain negative depending on the timing of re imaging , the patient\u2019s metabolic bone status, and \nthe type and lo cation of the fracture. Thus, radiographs are specific but significantly insensitive. Despite this \nlimitation, all authorities agree that radiographs should be the initial imaging modality; if the findings are \nconclusive, no further imaging need be perform ed. \nVariant 2: S uspected stress (fatigue) fracture, hip.

Radiographs , if obtained , may be normal or demonstrate \nunilateral or bilateral linear areas of sclerosis. MR I does not use ionizing radiation and has excellent sensitivity, \nand it should be considered the imaging study of choice for definitive diagnosis. MRI typically demonstrates \nlinear T1 and T2 hypointense signal , representing fracture lines,  and T1 hypointense and T2 hyperintense signal \nin the surrounding bone marrow , representing associated edema. Bone scintigraphy  and CT are both associated \nwith radiation exposure to the fetus in a pregnant patient. There is currently insufficient evidence that gadolinium -\nbased contrast agents are without risk to the fetus, so they are recommended in pregnancy  only when information \ncannot be acquired from a noncontrast MRI  [76]. \nFor reference, the approximate mean fetal absorbed d ose from a pelvis radiograph is 1.1 mGy, from a pelvis CT is \n25 mGy, and from bone scintigraphy  is 4.6 mGy (early in pregnancy) and 1.8 mGy (at 9 months estimated \ngestational age) [77]. The specific risk to radiating the fetus appears to be childhood malignancy, with theoretical \nprojections suggesting that for  each 10-mGy exposure there is a maximum risk of 1 additional cancer death per \n1700 exposures [78]. There are no diagnostic radiographic, CT, or nuclear medicine procedures to be considered a \nrisk factor for genetic damage, malformation, or neurodevelopmental effects based on current knowledge  [79]. \nFurthermore, MRI may als o demonstrate other reasons for occult pelvic pain, such as soft -tissue abnormalities or \nthe subchondral hip or supra -acetabular stress fractures described in some osteoporotic patients [63]. The clinical \ndifferential diagnosis includes sacroiliitis from inflammatory or infectious causes, osteitis condensans ilii, and \nlumbosacral degenerative spondylosis  [60]. \nVariant 12: Suspect stress (fatigue or insufficiency) fracture of the long bones .

Women can be reassured that benefit far outweighs the risk wi th regard to diagnostic imaging, as all \nradiographs and CT sc ans not involving the abdomen or pelvis hav e a predicted fetal absorbed dose of less than 1 \nmGy  [80]. Radiographs should be the initial imaging evaluation because findings may be conclusive , in which \ncase no further imaging should be performed. MRI does not use ionizing radiation and can  be used  as necessary to \nmake the diagnosis.  \nSummary of Recommendations  \n\u2022 In the setting of a suspected fatigue fracture, the initial imaging test should be radiography of the area of \ninterest, although it is not a sensitive examination. \n\u2022 If there is clinical concern  for a fatigue fracture of the hip and initial radiographs are negative, MRI without \ncontrast should be performed because of the high risk of complications.  \n\u2022 In the setting of a suspected fatigue fracture in a location other than the hip with initial negati ve radiographs, \neither repeat radiographs in 10  to 14 days or MRI without contrast may be appropriate depending on the \nlocation of pain and relative risk of complications secondary to stress fractures in that area.  \n\u2022 If there is an immediate need -to-know sit uation to diagnose a stress fracture in the setting of negative \nradiographs, for example,  professional football player, then MRI w ithout contrast is recommended.  \n\u2022 MRI without contrast and potentially total-body DXA provide prognostic information, which may help initial \nreturn -to-play evaluations.  \n\u2022 Although insensitive, radiographs should be the initial imaging study of choice for suspected insufficiency \nfractures in the pelvis or hip.", "However, axial CT alone can have false negatives because of  the constraint of the axial plane (in \none study, half of stress fractures were inadequately demonstrated on CT) [ 47]. Therefore, if CT is used to \nconfirm stress fracture in a long bone, multiplanar reformatting is necessary.

Rosenberg, \nMD16; Nehal A. Shah, MD17; Kirstin M. Small, MD18; Barbara N. Weissman, MD.19 \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntrodu ction/Background \nStress fractures occur in 2  varieties: 1) fatigue fractures result ing from repetitive submaximal stress on normal \nbone , resulting in a region of accelerated bone remodeling [ 1], and 2) insufficiency fractures due to normal \nactivity on bones that are deficient in microstructure and/ or mineralization [ 2]. At the microscopic level, repetitive \noverloading leads to increased osteoclastic activity that exceeds the rate of osteoblastic new bone formati on. This \nresults in bone weakening and microtrabecular disruption (stress injury) and eventually may lead to a cortical \nbreak (stress fracture). Stress fractures are encountered frequently and account for up to 20% of all injuries seen in \nsports medicine clinics  [3]. Stress fractures are particularly common in athletes participating in activities that \nrequire running and jumping, as well as in ballet dancers and military recruits [4,5]. On the other hand, we now \nrecognize that certain medical interventions such as radiation therapy and long -term osteoporosis treatment with \nbisphosphonates predispose patients to stress fractures  [6,7]. \nThe use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has greatly improved our abili ty to diagnose radiographically \noccult stress fractures. Both fatigue and insufficiency fractures are now being more frequently recognized as a \nsource of pain in patients, and although fatigue  and insufficiency fractures can be self -limited and go on to he aling \nwith or without diagnosis, there is usually value in  making the diagnosis. With continued activity, some stress \ninjuries and incomplete (unicortical) stress fractures will progress to completion and require more invasive \ntreatment or delay in return to activity. Also, the differential diagnosis of fatigue/insufficiency fractures includes \nentities that would be treated significantly differently than stress fractures (osteoid osteoma or osteomyelitis in the \nyounger patient, metastases in the older patient). The clinical picture is further clouded by the fact that many older \npatients with insufficiency fractures have histories of previous malignancy.  \nOverview of Imaging Modalities  \nRadiography  \nRadiography is the least expensive and most widely available im aging modality. Radiographs in at least 2  planes \nshould be obtained as the initial imaging study in every patient suspected of having a stress fracture.  Early \nradiographic findings are often nonspecific, for example,  subtle periosteal reaction, \u201cgray cortex \u201d sign, or even \nnonexistent as initial radiographs have reported sensitives of only 15 to 35% [8]. Over time, patients develop \nmore specific radiographic findings, for example,  linear sclerosis perpendicular to the trabeculae.  \nBone scan \nThe bone scan  was regarded  for many years as the gold standard for detecting stress -induced injuries and was \nvalued for its sensitivity. Dobrindt et al [ 9] reported the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive \nvalue, and negative predictive value of bone scintigraphy for detection of stress injuries as 92.9%, 73.8%, 83.3%, \n78.0% , and 91.2%, respectively.", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 8 Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture  tomography (SPECT) is more accurate in diagnosing stress injuries than planar scintigraphy alone [ 10]. The \nobjecti on to the studies quoting high accuracy for bone scintigraphy is that in all of them, positive bone \nscintigraphy is taken as the gold standard for detecting stress fractures and therefore sensitivity is 100%. \nHowever, depending on the staging criteria for bone scintigraphy pattern, the abnormalities may in fact be stress \nreactions rather than actual stress fractures [4,5,7]. Nonetheless, it is clear that bone scintigraphy shows stress \nfractures days to weeks earlier than radiographs in many instances and differentiates between osseous and soft -\ntissue injury as well.  \nMagnetic resonance imaging  \nMRI is extremely sensitive and demonstrates stress abnormalities as early as bone scintigraphy and with as much \nsensitivity [11-14] . The recent literature favors MRI as the procedure of choice for making an early diagnosis of \nboth varieties of stress fractures [15-28 ]. In this regard, MRI out performs radiography, bone scintigraphy, and \ncomputed tomography (CT). Fluid-sensitive sequences are the favored initial sequence for MRI screening [ 29]. \nWith a small field of view, short tau inversion recovery and/or T1-weighted imaging will usually demonstrate a \nfracture line surrounded by edema. In the absence of an actual stress fracture, stress reaction or muscle/tendon \ninjuries can be identified using fluid -sensitive sequences. Thus, MRI may be as sensitive as bone scintigraphy  but \nalso considerably more specific [19,23]. Intravenous contrast is not needed for diagnosis and has yet to provide \nany additional information.  MRI examination of an osseous stress injury contains prognostic as well as diagnostic \ninformation [30,31]. \nComputed tomography  \nCT is not typically used as a first - or second -line imaging tool in the workup of stress fractures  but may offer an \nadjunct role when other im aging modalities are equivocal [ 23], particularly in the pelvis or sacrum . Although  \nsuperior to radiography, it is less sensitive than nu clear scintigraphy or MRI [19]. The benefit of CT seems to lie \nin its specificity, ranging from 88%  to 98% in a recent meta-analysis looking at diagnostic accuracy of imaging \nmodalities for lower -extremity stress fractures, and thus may confirm a suspected stress fracture based on MRI  \n[32]. However, CT does involve ionizing radiation, so it is typically used only when MRI is equivocal.  For the \nevaluation of stress fractures, intravenous contrast is not helpful as a part of CT examinations.  \nUltrasound  \nThere is limited evidence on the u tility of ultrasound in diagnosing stress fractures. Ultrasound is a first -line \nimaging modality in assessing muscles, tendons, joints, and nerves in the extremities  [33], so the radiologist \nshould know the typical sono graphic appearance of stress fractures. S onographic findings of s tress fractures \ninclude  subcutaneous edema , periosteal thickening, cortical bone irregularity, local hyperemia  [33-35 ], and \nperiosteal callus.  Overall, ultrasound appears to be more sensitive than specif ic [32], and similar ultrasound \nfindings can be seen in osteomyelitis or neoplasm. Furthermore, ultrasound cannot evalua te the subcortical bone, \nso trabecular stress fractures may be missed. Although touted as cheap and quick to perform , it is limited a s an \noperator -dependent modality.  \nVariant 1: S uspected stress (fatigue) fracture,  excluding vertebrae.

Diabetes-related  foot \ncomplications , such as soft-tissue infection, osteomyelitis , and neuropathic  osteoarthropathy,  account  for up to \n20% of all diabetic -related  North  American  hospital  admissions,  with up to $1.5 billion  spent  annually in the \nUnited  States  on diabetic  foot ulcer  care [2]. \nNeuropathic  changes in the foot are present  in about  1% of diabetics [3]. Neuropathic  osteoarthropathy  is a \nprogressive  process affecting  the bones,  joints , and soft tissue of the foot and ankle.  Delay  in the diagnosis  may \nlead to derangement  of the bony architecture of the foot, deformity,  recurrent  foot ulcerations,  cellulitis,  \nosteomyelitis , and amputation [4]. \nImaging findings  should not be interpreted  in isolation. Clinical  features that suggest  osteomyelitis  include  an \nulcer  area >2 cm\u00b2, an elevated  erythrocyte  sedimentation  rate level  of >70 mm/hour,  positive probe -to-bone  test, a \nnonhealing  ulcer  for 6 months,  erythema,  fever,  and elevated  white blood cell (WBC) count  [2,5,6]. A negative  \nprobe -to-bone  test may exclude  the diagnosis  of osteomyelitis  with a high negative  predictive  value  [7]. The \nInfectious  Diseases Society  of American  recommends performing  the probe -to-bone  test on any diabetic  foot \ninfection  with an open wound [8]. Deep  wound cultures correlate well with osseous cultures and provide  a \nsensitive method in assessing  and targeting  likely  pathogens  that cause osseous infections  [9]. \nFor the diabetic  foot with a clinical  examination  suggesting crepitus where soft-tissue gas associated  with wet \ngangrene  is suspected,  please see the ACR  Appropria teness  Criteria\u00ae topic  on Suspected  Osteomyelitis,  Septic  \nArthritis, or Soft Tissue Infection  (Excluding  Spine  and Diabetic Foot)  for appropriate  guidance  [10]. \nDiscussion  of Procedures  by Variant  \nVariant  1: Suspected  osteomyelitis of the foot in patients  with  diabetes  mellitus.

Overall \nsensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs \nin the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral \nand oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar \ncoalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs \non the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have \nbeen found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable \nmethods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  \nRadiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review \nby Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for \nradiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.  \nRadiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  \nusually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, \nosteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite \nversus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess \nwith radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton\u2019s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other \ncauses of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg\u2019s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals \nor soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . \nThough radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in \npatients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5].

Diabetic foot osteomyelitis  and neuroarthropathy  can be difficult  to \ndifferentiate  clinically.  The early  diagnosis  of neuropathic  disease prior  to the development  of radiographic  \nchange  is important, as these  patients  will be treated  with altered  footwear  and orthotics  to prevent  the progression  \nto deformity.  \nUS Foot  \nUS is of limited  benefit  in the detection  of adult  osteomyelitis  because of its inability  to penetrate the cortex  of the \nbone.", "The role of US in the diabetic  foot includes detecti on of  subperiosteal  and soft-tissue abscesses,  \ntenosynovitis,  joint effusions,  and radiolucent  foreign  bodies.

The utility of MRI in the detection of radiographically occult Chopart \nfractures has been demonstrated by Almeida et al [64] . Baker et al [71]  analyzed 31 occult fractures involving the \nankle and foot in h ockey players,  finding five occult fractures in the foot, all of which involved the navicular bone. \nPierre -Jerome et al [72] found 79% of cuboid fractures in the diabetic population that were radiographically occult \nusing MRI. MRI is also useful in the detection of occult fractures involving the fifth metatarsal bone (Jones fracture) \nand the subtalar join t [65,73] . There is no evidence in the literature supporting the routine use of contrast in the \ndiagnosi s of occult fractures.  \nMRI has replaced bone scans in the evaluation of symptomatic accessory ossicles. MRI allows optimal visualization \nof the bone marrow within the ossicle and visualization of the synchondrosis. Accessory ossicles may also be \nassociated  with tendon pathology, which is also well assessed on MRI [74]. MRI allows clear demonstration of the \nfindings often associated with posterior ankle impingement syndrome [75]. Contrast administration is not routinely \nperformed when assessing symptomatic accessory ossicles on MRI; however, contrast within a disrupted \nsynchondrosis may be demonstrated on MR arthrography stu dies [69]. \nUS Foot   \nAlthough not routinely performed, previous studies have demonstrated the role of US in the detection of occult foot \nfractures. On US, these can be seen as cortical irregularities and are frequently associated with soft -tissue injury in \nthe acute or subacute setting. Wang et al [76]  demonstrated 24 cases of radiographically occult ankle and foot \nfractures in 268 patients. Of these, foot fractures were found most frequently in the calcaneus and metatarsals, and \nless frequently in the navicular, cuboid , and cuneiform bones.  \nOn US, several findings have been reported in cases of painful accessory ossicles, including patients with posterior \nankle impingement syndrome ; however , optimal characterization of the synchondrosis is difficult on US [62] .

Studies looking at the presence of so ft-tissue injury on cervical spine MRI in patients with \nunreliable physical or neurological examination and negativ e CT have found MRI to be positive in 6% to 49% of \npatients [41,44,45,47,48,78]. Most of these injuries were  minor, requiring either no ch ange in management or \nonly extended cervical collar placement. However, approxi mately 1% of patients with an unreliable clinical \nexamination and negative cervical spine CT will have an unstable cervical spine injury  that requires surgical \nstabilization identified on MRI [38-41,44-48,78-80]. When co mpared with the use of CT with MRI for clearance \nof the cervical spine in mechanically ventilated patients,  use of CT alone has been found to result in decreased \nlength of intensive care unit stay, as well as decreased morb idity related to the rigid cervical collar and ventilation \nwhile demonstrating no missed unstable cervical spin e injuries or difference in patient mortality [80]. \nFurthermore, MRI has been found to have low (64% to 77%) specificity in identifying clinically significant \ninterspinous ligament, intervertebral disc, and paraspinal muscle injury [62]. \nWhile not limited to obtunded patients, recent prospectiv e multicenter trials suggest that MRI has a role in \nevaluating patients who have a negative cervical spine CT. The Western Trauma Association Multi-Institutional \ntrial reported that CT was effective for ruling out clinically  significant injury with a sensitivity of 98.5%. A small \nbut clinically significant incidence of a missed injury was noted [56]. The prospective ReCONECT trial studied \n767 patients who had a negative cervical spine CT and we nt on to MRI because of cervicalgia (43.0%), inability \nto evaluate (44.1%), or both (9.4%). MRI was abnormal in 23.6% of all patients, including ligamentous injury \n(16.6%), soft-tissue swelling (4.3%), vertebral disc injury  (1.4%), and dural hematomas (1.3%).

Eleven patients underwent cervical spine surgery af ter the MRI results. The clin ical significance of these \nabnormal MRI findings could not be determined from this study group [55].

Next imaging study. \nCT Myelography Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nCT myelography can be performed to assess for traumatic spinal canal narrowing that is due to disc herniation or \nepidural hematoma and to assess for preganglionic nerve root avulsions. Ho wever, as with conventional CT, CT \nmyelography is inferior to MRI in assessing cord contus ion, cord hemorrhage, and postganglionic nerve root \ninjuries [40,41,43,57]. Performance of thoracolumbar CT myelogram can also be technically challenging, \nparticularly in patients with suspected  unstable thoracolumbar spine injury. \nCT Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nCT does play a role in the initial assessment of thoracic and lumbar spine injury. However, CT is significantly \ninferior to MRI in identifying many soft-tissue pathologies,  such as cord contusion, epidural hematoma, and nerve \nroot avulsions that can cause neurologic deficits re quiring surgical intervention [40,41,43,57]. Therefore, CT \nshould not be considered adequate for excluding signifi cant soft-tissue pathology in patients presenting with \nthoracolumbar spine trauma and neurologic deficit. \nMRI Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nMRI should be performed in patients who have possible spinal  cord injury, in whom there is clinical concern for \ncord compression that is due to disc protrusion or hema toma, and in those suspected of ligamentous instability. \nMRI is valuable for characterizing the cause of myelopathy in  patients with spinal cord  injury. The severity of the \ninjury\u2014including extent of intramedullary hemorrhage , length of edema, and evidence of cord transection\u2014\ncontributes to predicting outcome. Compression of the cord  by disc herniation, bone fragments, and hematomas is \nbest displayed on MRI, and MRI may be used to guide su rgical interventions [41,43]. For these reasons, the MRI \nexamination should include T2-weighted images as well as gradient-echo images. In the subacute and chronic \nstages after cord trauma, MRI can help define the extent of  cord injury. This is particularly important in patients \nwho suffer late deterioration, which is sometimes cau sed by treatable etiologies like the development or \nenlargement of intramedullary cavities,  such as a post-traumatic syringomyelia. \nAlthough numerous research studies ha ve reported a potential value of diffusion MRI for characterizing spinal \ncord injury [111], technical problems have prevented wid espread application of this technique to human studies. \nThe current utility of diffusion MRI for assessing cord trauma remains unknown. \nSummary of Recommendations \n\uf0b7 Variant 1: Imaging is not recommended for the initial imaging of patients \u226516 years of age and <65 years of \nage with suspected acute blunt cervi cal spine trauma when imaging is  not indicated by NEXUS or CCR \nclinical criteria and the patient meets low-risk criteria. \n\uf0b7 Variant 2: CT cervical spine without IV contrast is usually  appropriate for the initial imaging of patients \u226516 \nyears of age with suspected acute blunt trauma of the cervical spine when imaging is indicated by NEXUS or \nCCR clinical criteria. \n\uf0b7 Variant 3: MRI cervical spine without IV contrast is usua lly appropriate as the next imaging study for \npatients \u226516 years of age with suspected acute blunt trauma of the cervical spine and confirmed or suspected \ncervical spinal cord or nerve root injury, with or  without traumatic injury identified on cervical CT. \n\uf0b7 Variant 4: CT cervical spine without IV contrast and MRI cervical spine without IV contrast are usually \nappropriate for patients \u226516 years of age with acute cervical spine injury detected on radiographs and \ntreatment planning for mechanically unstable spine.

Blunt trauma meeting criteria for thoracic and lumbar \nimaging. Initial imaging. \nImaging is a crucial component in assessment of thoracic and lumbar spine injury. Fr om 1998 to 2011, there was \nan adjusted annual increase of approximately 8% in thor acolumbar spine fractures in patients involved in motor \nvehicle collisions [15]. Thoracolumbar fractures are cha llenging to identify clinically, with only 48% to 75% of \nthoracolumbar injuries identified on clinical examination [16-18]. Unlike cervical injuries, well-defined clinical \ncriteria have not been established to determine when thor acolumbar imaging is appropriate in the setting of blunt \ntraumatic injury. Since clinical examination has poor sen sitivity for identifying thoracolumbar injuries, any high-\nrisk patient (mid line thoracolumbar tenderness, high-energ y mechanism of injury, or >60 years of age), as well as \nunexaminable patients (intoxicated, GCS <15, distracting injury), should undergo imaging of the thoracolumbar \nspine. Screening of the entire spine is advised, as an es timated 20% of spine injuries will have a second associated \nspinal injury at a noncontiguous level [26,27]. \nRadiography  Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nIt is well established that CT outperforms radiographs in  the diagnosis of thoracolumbar spine fractures [104-\n108]. Radiographs have a reported sens itivity of 49% to 62% for identifying thoracic spine fractures and 67% to \n82% sensitivity for identifying lumbar spine fractures [ 104,107,108] compared with the reported sensitivity of \n94% to 100% for identifying thoracolumbar spine fract ures using CT [104,107,108]. However, the clinical \nsignificance of fractures missed on radiographs is uncertain . If screening of the thoracolumbar spine is performed \nusing radiographs, imaging should consis t of anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the thoracic and lumbar \nspine with additional \u201cswimmer\u2019s lateral\u201d view of the upper thoracic spine if this region is obscured by the \noverlying shoulders. \nCT Myelography Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nThere is no role for CT myelography in the in itial assessment of thoraco lumbar spine injury. \nCT Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nCT is the gold standard for identifying fractures of the t horacolumbar spine with a reported sensitivity of 94% to \n100% [104,107-110]. In addition to identifying thoracolumbar spine injuri es, CT is excellent for delineating soft-\ntissue injuries of the chest, abdomen, and pelvic regi on that often accompany spinal fractures. However, CT \nimaging of the thoracolumbar spine is more commonly pe rformed as part of CT evaluation of the entire thorax, \nabdomen, and pelvis in trauma patients with high index of suspicion for soft-tissue injuries or who cannot be \ncleared by clinical examination. It is debated whethe r dedicated reformatted images using collimated field-of-\nviews centered on the thoracolumbar spine with dedicated  \u201chard kernel\u201d image algorithms are more accurate for \nidentifying bony pathology. Recent studi es indicate that identification of thoracolumbar spine fractures on routine \nthoracic, abdomen, and pelvic CT imaging using routine body large fields of view and \u201csoft kernel\u201d image \nalgorithms is comparable to dedicated thoracolumbar spine reformatted images. Se nsitivity of thoracolumbar \nspine fracture detection using routine body imaging prot ocols has been reported at 94% to 99% compared with \n97% to 99% sensitivity using dedicated thoracolumbar spin e protocols with no statistically significant difference \nin sensitivity between the two protocols [109,110].", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 9 Suspected Spine Trauma however, dual-energy CT is not widely available. CTA imag ing is best reserved for patients with a high index of \nsuspicion for cervical arterial injury. \nMRI Cervical Spine \nMRI is generally considered inferior to CT in identify ing fractures. MRI is superior to CT in identifying soft-\ntissue injuries of the cervical spine [37-42]. Trauma patients with negative cervical spine CT will have traumatic \nsoft-tissue injuries identified on MRI in 5% to 24% of  cases [39-41,44,45,47,48]. The id entification of these soft-\ntissue injuries often results in extended placement of a cervical collar. However, in  the absence of clinical \nevidence of neurologic or unstable ligament injury, MRI h as a very low probability of identifying a soft-tissue \ninjury requiring surgical treatment that is not appare nt on CT [40,41,43-48,55]. Recent prospective multicenter \ntrials suggest that MRI has a role in evaluating patie nts who have a negative cervical spine CT. The Western \nTrauma Association Multi-Institutional trial reported that CT was effective for ruling out clinically significant \ninjury with a sensitivity of 98.5%. A small but clinically  significant incidence of a mi ssed injury was noted, and \nfurther imaging with MRI is warranted [56].

Suspected acute cervical spine blunt trauma. Imaging \nindicated by NEXUS or CCR clinical criteria. Initial imaging. \nThe high sensitivity of both the NEXUS criteria and CCR for detecting significant cervical spine injury comes at \na cost of both criteria having a very low specificity fo r significant cervical spine injury. NEXUS has a reported \nsensitivity of 81.2% to 99.6% with a specificity of 12.9%  to 45.8% [4,11]. The original study of CCR by Stiell et \nal [5] reported a sensitivity of 100%, whic h was confirmed in later studies by Du ane et al [11,12]. In head-to-head \ncomparisons, specificity of CCR has been reported from 0.6% to 42.5% [5,7,11,12], overlapping that of the NEXUS criteria. Both of these criteria are widely used fo r clinical screening for cervical spine injury, and it is \ngenerally accepted that patients who do not meet either the NEXUS or CCR criteria do not require imaging evaluation for cervi cal spine injury. \nRadiography Cervical Spine \nRadiographs have largely been supplanted by CT for ass essment of traumatic cervical spine injury. It is well \nestablished that CT is significantly more sensitive than radiographs for identifying cervical spine fractures, with \nradiographs identifying only about a third of fractures visible on CT [31]. Radiographs of the cervical spine should consist of, at minimum, 3 views:  anteroposterior, lateral, and open-m outh odontoid views."], ["ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 18 Suspected Spine Trauma Variant 10: Age greater than or equal to 16 years. Ac ute thoracic or lumbar spine injury detected on \nradiographs or noncontrast CT. Neurologic abnormalities. Next imaging study. \nCT Myelography Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nCT myelography can be performed to assess for traumatic spinal canal narrowing that is due to disc herniation or \nepidural hematoma and to assess for preganglionic nerve root avulsions. Ho wever, as with conventional CT, CT \nmyelography is inferior to MRI in assessing cord contus ion, cord hemorrhage, and postganglionic nerve root \ninjuries [40,41,43,57]. Performance of thoracolumbar CT myelogram can also be technically challenging, \nparticularly in patients with suspected  unstable thoracolumbar spine injury. \nCT Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nCT does play a role in the initial assessment of thoracic and lumbar spine injury. However, CT is significantly \ninferior to MRI in identifying many soft-tissue pathologies,  such as cord contusion, epidural hematoma, and nerve \nroot avulsions that can cause neurologic deficits re quiring surgical intervention [40,41,43,57]. Therefore, CT \nshould not be considered adequate for excluding signifi cant soft-tissue pathology in patients presenting with \nthoracolumbar spine trauma and neurologic deficit. \nMRI Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nMRI should be performed in patients who have possible spinal  cord injury, in whom there is clinical concern for \ncord compression that is due to disc protrusion or hema toma, and in those suspected of ligamentous instability. \nMRI is valuable for characterizing the cause of myelopathy in  patients with spinal cord  injury. The severity of the \ninjury\u2014including extent of intramedullary hemorrhage , length of edema, and evidence of cord transection\u2014\ncontributes to predicting outcome. Compression of the cord  by disc herniation, bone fragments, and hematomas is \nbest displayed on MRI, and MRI may be used to guide su rgical interventions [41,43]. For these reasons, the MRI \nexamination should include T2-weighted images as well as gradient-echo images. In the subacute and chronic \nstages after cord trauma, MRI can help define the extent of  cord injury. This is particularly important in patients \nwho suffer late deterioration, which is sometimes cau sed by treatable etiologies like the development or \nenlargement of intramedullary cavities,  such as a post-traumatic syringomyelia. \nAlthough numerous research studies ha ve reported a potential value of diffusion MRI for characterizing spinal \ncord injury [111], technical problems have prevented wid espread application of this technique to human studies. \nThe current utility of diffusion MRI for assessing cord trauma remains unknown. \nSummary of Recommendations \n\uf0b7 Variant 1: Imaging is not recommended for the initial imaging of patients \u226516 years of age and <65 years of \nage with suspected acute blunt cervi cal spine trauma when imaging is  not indicated by NEXUS or CCR \nclinical criteria and the patient meets low-risk criteria. \n\uf0b7 Variant 2: CT cervical spine without IV contrast is usually  appropriate for the initial imaging of patients \u226516 \nyears of age with suspected acute blunt trauma of the cervical spine when imaging is indicated by NEXUS or \nCCR clinical criteria. \n\uf0b7 Variant 3: MRI cervical spine without IV contrast is usua lly appropriate as the next imaging study for \npatients \u226516 years of age with suspected acute blunt trauma of the cervical spine and confirmed or suspected \ncervical spinal cord or nerve root injury, with or  without traumatic injury identified on cervical CT. \n\uf0b7 Variant 4: CT cervical spine without IV contrast and MRI cervical spine without IV contrast are usually \nappropriate for patients \u226516 years of age with acute cervical spine injury detected on radiographs and \ntreatment planning for mechanically unstable spine.

Blunt trauma meeting criteria for thoracic and lumbar \nimaging. Initial imaging. \nImaging is a crucial component in assessment of thoracic and lumbar spine injury. Fr om 1998 to 2011, there was \nan adjusted annual increase of approximately 8% in thor acolumbar spine fractures in patients involved in motor \nvehicle collisions [15]. Thoracolumbar fractures are cha llenging to identify clinically, with only 48% to 75% of \nthoracolumbar injuries identified on clinical examination [16-18]. Unlike cervical injuries, well-defined clinical \ncriteria have not been established to determine when thor acolumbar imaging is appropriate in the setting of blunt \ntraumatic injury. Since clinical examination has poor sen sitivity for identifying thoracolumbar injuries, any high-\nrisk patient (mid line thoracolumbar tenderness, high-energ y mechanism of injury, or >60 years of age), as well as \nunexaminable patients (intoxicated, GCS <15, distracting injury), should undergo imaging of the thoracolumbar \nspine. Screening of the entire spine is advised, as an es timated 20% of spine injuries will have a second associated \nspinal injury at a noncontiguous level [26,27]. \nRadiography  Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nIt is well established that CT outperforms radiographs in  the diagnosis of thoracolumbar spine fractures [104-\n108]. Radiographs have a reported sens itivity of 49% to 62% for identifying thoracic spine fractures and 67% to \n82% sensitivity for identifying lumbar spine fractures [ 104,107,108] compared with the reported sensitivity of \n94% to 100% for identifying thoracolumbar spine fract ures using CT [104,107,108]. However, the clinical \nsignificance of fractures missed on radiographs is uncertain . If screening of the thoracolumbar spine is performed \nusing radiographs, imaging should consis t of anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the thoracic and lumbar \nspine with additional \u201cswimmer\u2019s lateral\u201d view of the upper thoracic spine if this region is obscured by the \noverlying shoulders. \nCT Myelography Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nThere is no role for CT myelography in the in itial assessment of thoraco lumbar spine injury. \nCT Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nCT is the gold standard for identifying fractures of the t horacolumbar spine with a reported sensitivity of 94% to \n100% [104,107-110]. In addition to identifying thoracolumbar spine injuri es, CT is excellent for delineating soft-\ntissue injuries of the chest, abdomen, and pelvic regi on that often accompany spinal fractures. However, CT \nimaging of the thoracolumbar spine is more commonly pe rformed as part of CT evaluation of the entire thorax, \nabdomen, and pelvis in trauma patients with high index of suspicion for soft-tissue injuries or who cannot be \ncleared by clinical examination. It is debated whethe r dedicated reformatted images using collimated field-of-\nviews centered on the thoracolumbar spine with dedicated  \u201chard kernel\u201d image algorithms are more accurate for \nidentifying bony pathology. Recent studi es indicate that identification of thoracolumbar spine fractures on routine \nthoracic, abdomen, and pelvic CT imaging using routine body large fields of view and \u201csoft kernel\u201d image \nalgorithms is comparable to dedicated thoracolumbar spine reformatted images. Se nsitivity of thoracolumbar \nspine fracture detection using routine body imaging prot ocols has been reported at 94% to 99% compared with \n97% to 99% sensitivity using dedicated thoracolumbar spin e protocols with no statistically significant difference \nin sensitivity between the two protocols [109,110].", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 14 Suspected Spine Trauma patients with ligament injury identified on MRI had an abnormality identified on flex ion-extension radiographs. \nFurthermore, flexion-extension radiographs carry  the real danger of producing neurologic injury. \nCT Myelography Cervical Spine \nThere is no role for myelography in assessment of an obt unded patient without traumatic injury identified on CT \nin the absence of physical examination signs  of spinal cord or nerve root injury. \nCTA Head and Neck \nPatients presenting with a neurologic abnormality that is unexplained by a diagnosed cervical spine injury should \nbe evaluated for blunt cerebrovascular injury [65]. \nMRI Cervical Spine \nThe utilization of MRI in obtunded trauma patients is contr oversial. The crucial issue is  \u201care risks associated with \nperforming MRI in obtunded patients worth discovery of the rare case of unstable cervical spine injury in a \npatient with a cervical spine CT that shows no acute injury?\u201d MRI is superior  to CT in identifying cervical spine \nligament injuries [77]. Studies looking at the presence of so ft-tissue injury on cervical spine MRI in patients with \nunreliable physical or neurological examination and negativ e CT have found MRI to be positive in 6% to 49% of \npatients [41,44,45,47,48,78]. Most of these injuries were  minor, requiring either no ch ange in management or \nonly extended cervical collar placement. However, approxi mately 1% of patients with an unreliable clinical \nexamination and negative cervical spine CT will have an unstable cervical spine injury  that requires surgical \nstabilization identified on MRI [38-41,44-48,78-80]. When co mpared with the use of CT with MRI for clearance \nof the cervical spine in mechanically ventilated patients,  use of CT alone has been found to result in decreased \nlength of intensive care unit stay, as well as decreased morb idity related to the rigid cervical collar and ventilation \nwhile demonstrating no missed unstable cervical spin e injuries or difference in patient mortality [80]. \nFurthermore, MRI has been found to have low (64% to 77%) specificity in identifying clinically significant \ninterspinous ligament, intervertebral disc, and paraspinal muscle injury [62]. \nWhile not limited to obtunded patients, recent prospectiv e multicenter trials suggest that MRI has a role in \nevaluating patients who have a negative cervical spine CT. The Western Trauma Association Multi-Institutional \ntrial reported that CT was effective for ruling out clinically  significant injury with a sensitivity of 98.5%. A small \nbut clinically significant incidence of a missed injury was noted [56]. The prospective ReCONECT trial studied \n767 patients who had a negative cervical spine CT and we nt on to MRI because of cervicalgia (43.0%), inability \nto evaluate (44.1%), or both (9.4%). MRI was abnormal in 23.6% of all patients, including ligamentous injury \n(16.6%), soft-tissue swelling (4.3%), vertebral disc injury  (1.4%), and dural hematomas (1.3%). The patients with \nabnormal MRI were less likely to have their cervical colla r removed than those with normal MRI (13.3% versus \n88.1%). Eleven patients underwent cervical spine surgery af ter the MRI results. The clin ical significance of these \nabnormal MRI findings could not be determined from this study group [55]. By inference, it is likely that some \nobtunded patients with negative cervical spine CT will have abnormal MRI, and some of these MRI-detected \ninjuries may require treatment. \nMRA Neck \nThere is no role for MRA in assessment of obtunded patie nts without traumatic injury identified on CT in the \nabsence of clinical findings concer ning for cervical vascular injury. \nArteriography Cervicocerebral \nThere is no role for arteriography in assessment of obtunded patients without traumatic injury identified on CT in \nthe absence of clinical findings con cerning for cervical vascular injury. \nVariant 7: Age greater than or equal to 16 years.

If the patient meets a \nlow-risk criterion for cervical spine injury, the patient is asked to rotate his head  left to right. If the patient is able \nto move his head 45\u00b0 past midline in both directions, the pa tient is clinically cleared of cervical spine injury.

An increasing rate of t horacolumbar spine fractures h as been seen in the United \nStates over the past several decades, despite a decline in other motor vehicle\u2013related injuries [15]. While the exact \nreason for this increase is uncertain, it is likely due to a combination of both increased detection of thoracolumbar \nspine injury and increased rate of seatbelt injury. Similar to cervical in juries, there is a wide spectrum of \nthoracolumbar spine injuries ranging from stable, minor soft -tissue injuries to unstable fracture dislocations that \nare often accompanied by neurologic injuries. In contrast  to the cervical spine, there are no widely used and \nvalidated criteria to help determine if th oracolumbar spine imaging is appropriate. \nClinical examination has a low to very low sensitivit y for identifying thoracolumbar spine injuries [16-18]. \nTherefore, a low threshold should be maintained for screen ing the thoracolumbar spine with imaging in the setting \nof blunt trauma, particularly in older patients, who are at increased risk for spine fractures occurring in the setting \nof low-energy trauma, such as a fall from standing (ie,  fragility fractures), which are due to diminished bone \nmineralization commonly present in older patient populations . A low threshold for imaging of the thoracolumbar", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 7 Suspected Spine Trauma spine should also be maintained for patients with di sease processes known to cause spin e rigidity, such as diffuse \nidiopathic skeletal hyperostosis or ankylosing spondylitis. \nA comprehensive literature review of thoracolumbar trau ma was performed by Hsu et al [19] in 2003 with the \nconclusion that patients should undergo im aging of the thoracolumbar spine if  the following criteria were present: \n(1) back pain or midline tenderness, (2) local signs of thoracolumbar injury, (3) abnormal neurological signs, (4) \ncervical spine fracture, (5) Glasgow Coma  Scale score (GCS) <15, (6) major distracting injury, or (7) alcohol or \ndrug intoxication. A prospective study by Holmes et al [20] of 152 patients with thoracolumbar spine injury in 2003 found 100% negative predictive value for thoracolumbar spine injury in patients not meeting any of the \nfollowing criteria: (1) complaints of thoracolumbar spine pain, (2) thoracolumb ar spine tenderness, (3) a \ndecreased level of consciousness, (4) intoxication with etha nol or drugs, (5) a neurologic deficit, or (6) a painful \ndistracting injury. A prospective study of over 3,000 adult blunt trauma patients performed by Inaba et al [21] in \n2015 found 98.9% sensitivity for identifying patients with clin ically significant thoracolumbar spine injury using \nthe following criteria: (1) positive physical examination (i ncluding neurologic deficit), (2) high-risk mechanism of \ninjury, and (3) \u226560 years of age. It should be noted that in the study by Inaba et al, patients with altered \nconsciousness (GCS <15), intoxication, or painful distrac ting injury were excluded from analysis because of their \ninability to perform an adequate examination necessitating imaging clear ance of the thoracolumbar spine. \nHowever, none of these 3 proposed criteria have  been validated independently (Table 4). \nTable 4.

In the setting of spinal cord or \nnerve root injury, evaluation of those findings should  be addressed separately by the ACR Appropriateness \nCriteria\u00ae topic on \u201c Myelopathy \u201d [22] or the ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae topic on \u201c Plexopathy \u201d [23], \nrespectively.

In a 2015 \nstudy by Zhuge et al [62], MRI demonstrated 100% sensitiv ity for diagnosis of injury to the cervical paraspinal \nmuscles, intervertebral disc, and interspinous ligament but  with specificities of only 77%, 71%, and 64% for these \nstructures, respectively. Therefore, care should be taken in  interpretation of soft-tissue injuries identified on MRI. \nVariant 5: Age greater than or equal to 16 years. Susp ected acute cervical spine blunt trauma. Clinical or \nimaging findings suggest arterial injury with or wi thout positive cervical spine CT. Next imaging study. \nArterial injury can be a concern in blunt and penetrating spinal injury. An estimated 1% to 3% of blunt trauma \npatients are diagnosed with cerebrovascular injury  [63,64]. These injuries can include transection, \npseudoaneurysm formation, and simple dissection. Di ssections and pseudoaneurysms  may or may not produce \nstenosis and flow limitation of the affected artery. The presence of dissection in itself is generally taken to \nrepresent a risk of thrombus forma tion and subsequent embolization. \nMany different head and neck injury patterns and c linical symptoms have been associated with blunt \ncerebrovascular injuries (BCVIs) [52,53,63-68]. Up to two-th irds of patients with BCVIs may be asymptomatic at \npresentation [65] and not develop stroke-like symptoms for 48 to 72 hours after initial blunt trauma injury [63,64]. \nScreening for BCVI is ideally performed  to appropriately initiate anticoagul ation therapy prior to the patient \ndeveloping neurologic deficits. While there are no univer sally accepted criteria for guiding imaging evaluation for \nBCVI, the high sensitivity and excellent negative predic tive value of the revised Denver criteria make it a \nreasonable set of criteria when screening blunt trauma patients for BCVI. The Denver screening criteria was first \nproposed in 1994 and subsequently revised in 2004 [6 3] and 2011 [65]. Under the revised Denver criteria, \ncerebrovascular imaging is indicated in any patient who h as one of the signs or symptoms of BCVI or one of the \nrisk factors for BCVI (Table 5). Beliaev et al [69] in 2014 validated the revised Denver criteria, finding 97% \nsensitivity for detecting BCVI with negative predictive value of 99.6%. Geddes et al [6 4] compared incidence of \nBCVI before and after introduction of the revised Denver protocol and found an incidence of BCVI of 2.99% in \nblunt trauma patients after implementation of the revised Denver protocol compared with an incidence of 2.36% \nprior to use of the Denver protocol, which suggests that  the protocol finds a significant number of cases of BCVI \ncompared with prior screening methods. Geddes et al [64]  also noted that use of the revised Denver protocol \nresulted in 29% more BCVIs identified in asymptomatic blunt trauma patients compared with their prior \nscreening criteria. \nTable 5."], ["ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 5 Low Back  Pain LOW  BACK  PAIN  \nExpert  Panel  on Neurological  Imaging:  Troy  A.

It is the fifth most  common  reason  \nfor a physician  visit in the United  States  and accounts for approximately  3% of visits  to the emergency  department  \n[2]. \nThe American  College  of Physicians and the American  Pain Society  classify  LBP into the following  broad  \ncategories:  nonspecific LBP, back  pain potentially  associated  with radiculopathy or spinal  stenosis,  and back  pain \npotentially  associated  with another  specific spinal  cause [3]. Additionally,  guidelines  from  the American  College  \nof Physicians and the American  Pain Society  [3,4]  emphasize a focused  history  and physical  examination,  \nreassurance,  initial pain management  medications if necessary,  and consideration  of physical  therapies without  \nroutine  imaging  in patients  with nonspecific  LBP. Duration  of symptoms  also helps  guide  treatment  algorithms  in \npatients  with acute,  subacute,  or chronic  LBP. Additionally, assessment  of psychosocial  risk factors when  obtaining  \npatient  history  is a strong predictor  of patients  who are predisposed  to developing chronic  disabling LBP problems  \n[3]. \nAlthough there  is great  variability  in the definition  of acute and subacute  LBP, for the purposes  of this guideline,  \nwe will use the Institute  for Clinical Systems  Improvement  definitions  of 0 to 4 weeks to define  acute LBP,  4 to 12 \nweeks for subacute LBP, and >12 weeks for chronic  LBP [5]. \nIt is clear  that uncomplicated  acute  LBP and/or  radiculopathy is a benign,  self-limited  condition  that does not \nwarrant  any imaging studies [4,6,7] . Imaging is considered  in those  patients who have  had up to 6 weeks of medical  \nmanagement  and physical  therapy  that resulted  in little or no improvement  in their back  pain.  It is also considered  \nfor those  patients  presenting  with red flags , raising  suspicion  for a serious underlying  condition,  such as cauda \nequina  syndrome  (CES),  malignancy,  fracture,  or infection  (see Table 1). \n \naUniversity of Utah Health, Salt Lake City, Utah. bResearch Author, University of Utah Medical Center, Salt Lake City, Utah. cPanel Chair, University of \nUtah, Salt Lake City, Utah. dPanel Vice- Chair, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Saint Louis, Missouri. eUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, \nPennsylvania. fThe Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio. gMontefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.", "One study found no \nstatistically  significant  difference in primary  outcome  after 1 year for patients  \u226565 years of age  who had spine  \nimaging  within  6 weeks after an initial visit for care for LBP versus  similar  patients who did not undergo early  \nimaging  [9].

Corey, MD.v \nSummary  of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nIn the United  States,  acute low back  pain (LBP),  with or without radiculopathy , is the leading  cause of years lived  \nwith disability  and the third  ranking cause of disability -adjusted  life years  [1]. It is the fifth most  common  reason  \nfor a physician  visit in the United  States  and accounts for approximately  3% of visits  to the emergency  department  \n[2]. \nThe American  College  of Physicians and the American  Pain Society  classify  LBP into the following  broad  \ncategories:  nonspecific LBP, back  pain potentially  associated  with radiculopathy or spinal  stenosis,  and back  pain \npotentially  associated  with another  specific spinal  cause [3]. Additionally,  guidelines  from  the American  College  \nof Physicians and the American  Pain Society  [3,4]  emphasize a focused  history  and physical  examination,  \nreassurance,  initial pain management  medications if necessary,  and consideration  of physical  therapies without  \nroutine  imaging  in patients  with nonspecific  LBP. Duration  of symptoms  also helps  guide  treatment  algorithms  in \npatients  with acute,  subacute,  or chronic  LBP. Additionally, assessment  of psychosocial  risk factors when  obtaining  \npatient  history  is a strong predictor  of patients  who are predisposed  to developing chronic  disabling LBP problems  \n[3]. \nAlthough there  is great  variability  in the definition  of acute and subacute  LBP, for the purposes  of this guideline,  \nwe will use the Institute  for Clinical Systems  Improvement  definitions  of 0 to 4 weeks to define  acute LBP,  4 to 12 \nweeks for subacute LBP, and >12 weeks for chronic  LBP [5]. \nIt is clear  that uncomplicated  acute  LBP and/or  radiculopathy is a benign,  self-limited  condition  that does not \nwarrant  any imaging studies [4,6,7] . Imaging is considered  in those  patients who have  had up to 6 weeks of medical  \nmanagement  and physical  therapy  that resulted  in little or no improvement  in their back  pain.  It is also considered  \nfor those  patients  presenting  with red flags , raising  suspicion  for a serious underlying  condition,  such as cauda \nequina  syndrome  (CES),  malignancy,  fracture,  or infection  (see Table 1). \n \naUniversity of Utah Health, Salt Lake City, Utah. bResearch Author, University of Utah Medical Center, Salt Lake City, Utah. cPanel Chair, University of \nUtah, Salt Lake City, Utah. dPanel Vice- Chair, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Saint Louis, Missouri. eUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, \nPennsylvania. fThe Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio. gMontefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.", "ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 6 Low Back  Pain Table  1.

No red flags.  No prior  management.  Initial \nimaging.  \nImaging is typically  not warranted  in this setting. Acute (<4 weeks\u2019  duration)  uncomplicated  (no red flags)  LBP, \nwith or without radiculopathy,  is considered  a self-limiting  condition  that is  responsive to medical  management  and \nphysical  therapy  in most  patients  [4,6,7] . Numerous  studies have  shown that routine  imaging  provides  no clinical  \nbenefit  in this group  [6,9] . Usually  no specific pathology for LBP can be identified. \nNonspe cific lumbar  disc abnormalities  are common in asymptomatic patients  and can be demonstrated  readily  on \nMRI,  CT, fluoroscopic  myelography,  and postmyelography CT of the lumbar  spine  [11]. Imaging abnormalities  \ncan be seen in a substantial  number  of people  without back  pain [11-13]. A prospective study by Carragee et al [13] \nfound that among patients with lumbar  imaging  abnormalities  before the onset  of LBP, 84% had unchanged or \nimproved findings  after symptoms  developed.  A systematic review of 33 articles found an increasing prevalence of \ndegenerative spine findings in asymptomatic patients of increasing age  [12]. For example,  disc protrusion  \nprevalence increased  from  29% of those 20 years of age to 43% of those  80 years of age in this asymptomatic  \npopulation.  A prospective  cohort  study of 20 patients  showed  no significant differences in MRI changes over 12 \nmonths  in patients  presenting  with acute LBP compared  with their asymptomatic counterparts , except  in disc \nherniation,  nerve  root compression,  and annular  fissure [15]. Even  in the setting  of disc herniation,  imaging  may \nhave  limited  role in management  as the majority  of disc herniations  show  some  degree of reabsorption  or regression  \nby 8 weeks after symptom onset  [16]. It is important  to note that repeat  imaging  in patients  with new episodes of \nLBP and previous  MRI scans are unlikely  to detect  differences in disc protrusion,  annular  fissures,  high-intensity  \nzones,  or end-plate  signal  changes [13]. \nDespite the lack of evidence to support  imaging early  or prior  to conservative treatment  for LBP, there is significant  \nvariation  in the ordering practices of physicians,  with nonadherance  to guidelines  leading  to increased  health  care \nutilization  [17,18] .

Accurate diagnosis  of disc disease can be provided  \nby MRI [7]. \nAlthough disc abnormalities are common on MRI in asymptomatic  patients,  LBP with radiculopathy or clinical  \nsigns  of spinal  stenosis suggests the presence of demonstrable  nerve  root compression  on MRI  [13]. In a study of \nsymptomatic  patients,  there  was a higher  prevalence  of herniation . Fifty -seven  percent  of patients with LBP  and \n65% of patients  with radiculopathy  had disc herniation  as compared  with the 20% to 28% prevalence reported  in \nthe asymptomatic series [7].

MRI is the most sensitive imaging test for detecting soft -tissue abnormalities associated with neck \npain but is characterized by a high rate of abnormalities in asymptomatic individuals [22, 23]. Most cervical \ndiscectomies are performed by an anterior approach  without transgression of the epidural space ; therefore , \nepidural scar  or granulation tissue formation is minimal,  and contrast -enhanced imaging is not routine ly used after \nACDF  [55].  Gadolinium -enhanced MRI may have a role in the setting of neck pain and prior posterior -approa ch \ncervical fusion/ decompressive procedures, although the majority of the literature to date evaluates the use of \ngadolinium -based contrast in the differentiation of recurrent disc herniations  (a potentially actionable finding) \nfrom epidural scar in the setting of lumbar spine surgery  [56,57]. \nBone Scan Whole Body with SPECT or SPECT/CT Neck  \nThere is no current role for nuclear medicine studies as the initial examination in this scenario. The role of Tc -\n99m bone scan in the setting of new or worsening neck pain in the postsurgical patient is limited, as radionuclide \nscans may remain positive f or a year or more in the region of the operative bed [58].

Suspected  spinal  metastases are typically  diagnosed using cross-sectional  \nimaging  with the dual goal of identifying potential metastases and characterizing  the extent  of malignancy.  As \nsuch,  the choice of imaging  modality  is often  based  on both the type of malignancy  and the presenting  clinical  \nfeatures,  especially  if referable to pathological  fracture,  cord compression , or nerve  root impingement. \nCT Cervical Spine  \nBecause of its high spatial resolution, CT is more sensitive than conventional radiography for the detection of \nbone metastases and has shown good correlation with nuclear bone scans,  particularly if coupled with concurrent \nCT examinations of the thorax, abdomen,  and/or pelvis [86]. CT can help characterize lesions as lytic or blastic \nand may successfully assess paravertebral or intraspinal exten sion if intravenous contrast is used [87]. CT is also \nuseful to obtain better structural definition of abnormal findings identified on scintigraphy or MRI [88], such as in \nthe setting of suspected pathologic fracture. However, given that CT is relatively insensitive for tumors restricted \nto the marrow space, the sensitivity of CT is relatively low in early malignant bone involvement [87, 89], and as \nsuch, MRI is favored as an initial diagnostic modality. \nCT Myelography Cervical Spine  \nThe literature search did not identify any studies regarding the use of CT myelography in the evaluation of this \nclinical presentation.  \nCTA Neck  \nThe literature search did not identify any studies regarding the use of CTA in the evaluation of this clinical \npresentation.  \nFluoride PET/CT whole body  \nF-18-sodium fluoride (NaF)  PET/CT has become an important tool for detecting and evaluating metastatic bone \ncancer [90,91] and may be a preferable modality for detecting metastatic bone disease i n morbidly obese patients;  \nhowever, there is currently no evidence supporting the validity  of F-18 NaF PET/CT as a first-line test evaluating \nacute neck pain or radicular symptoms in patients with malignancy.  \nPercutaneous Interventions \nThe literature search did not identify any studies regarding the use of  cervical facet joint, medial branch blocks, or \ndiscography as a first -line test  in the evaluation of this clinical presentation.  \nFDG -PET/CT Whole Body  \nFDG-PET/CT is sensitive for detection of metastatic disease and has been compared to detection rates of bone \nscans [92,93].

Advanced imaging is usually performed to determine disease activity, guide management decisions, and prognosticate outcomes.

Identifying active synovitis with power Doppler assessment is a useful adjunct \nin making an early diagnosis of RA when a pati ent with early arthritis does not meet the 2010 criteria established \nby the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism [20]. The presence of \nsynovitis predicts progression of erosions [31 ] and erosions themselves [35]. US can also depict small bone \nerosions with high spatial resolution; h owever, US is less sensitive to erosions that occur on the radial or ulnar \nsides of the inner carpal bones because direct scanning of these regions is blocked, unlike the dorsal and volar \nbone surfaces. Furthermore, unlike MRI, US cannot show changes within the bone marrow, which are  the \nstrongest prognosticator s for disease progression in RA [27, 28,32-34].

MRI is highly \naccurate for lesions involving the radial (central) zone of the disc, especially with the use of high -resolution fast \nspin-echo or 3-D grad ient-recalled pulse sequences [36]. There is some evidence suggesting that MRI performed \nwith a 3.0 T system is even more accurate than MRI performed with a 1.5 T system for TFCC lesions [37], but \nthere are no studies comparing the accuracy of the two field s trengths in the same patients. The sensitivity for \ntears of the ulnar attachment of the disc and the peripheral attachments (the ulnocarpal ligaments) are only fair \nwith noncontrast -enhanced wrist MRI [ 12,36]. IV contrast seldom provides added benefit in patients with ulnar -\nsided wrist pain but may increase sensitivity for TFCC lesions if MR arthrography is desired but direct joint \ninjection is not feasible. \nMR Arthrography  Wrist  \nDirect MR arthrography (performed with contrast injection of the radiocarpal or distal radioulnar compartments, \nalone or in combination) does result in better diagnostic accuracy for the T FCC compared with conventional MRI, \nespecially for ulnar -sided lesions [26, 38], even when compared to conventio nal MRI performed with a 3.0 T \nmagnet [7,8,39]. The same is true for intrinsic ligament injuries, such as those of the lunotriquetral ligament, \nwhich can produce ulnar -sided pain [7 ,8,39]. Performing either MR arthrography or noncontrast -enhanced MRI is \nusually appropriate in this scenario.  \nCT Arthrography  Wrist  \nThe accuracy of CT arthrography is superior to MRI  and similar to that  of MR arthrography for TFCC and \nintrinsic ligament lesions [8,40]. In addition, CT arthrography appears to be mor e accurate than either MRI or  MR \narthrography for identifying articular cartilage defects in the wrist [38]. In contrast to MRI and MR arthrography, \nCT arthrography is less sensitive to lesions occurring outside of the joint (like abnormalities of the extensor carpi \nulnaris tendon) that can result in ulnar -sided pain.  For these reasons, CT arthrography may be appropriate in this \nsetting , especially if there is a contraindication to MRI or if artifact from metallic implants produce too much \nartifact on MRI.  \nArthrography  Wrist  \nConventional (x-ray) arthrography\u2014performed with contrast injection into one  or more  wrist compartments\u2014has \nmoderate accuracy for the diagnosis of TFCC perforations [7 ].", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 7 Chronic Wrist Pain  CHRONIC WRIST PAIN\nExpert Panel on Musculoskeletal Imaging:  David A.

Kransdorf, MD.n \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nIn patients with chronic wrist pain, imaging studies are  an important adjunct to history, physical examination, \nlaboratory testing, and electrophysiology studies. The choice of imaging modality depends on the patient\u2019s \npresentation and the clinical questions being asked. There are scenarios in which no imaging beyond baseline \nradiographs is necessary, but in other situations advanced imaging has added value for diagnostic eva luation and \ntreatment planning.  \nOverview of Imaging Modalities  \nRadiographs  \nImaging evaluation of the painful wrist should begin with radiog raphs [1,2]. This simple study may establish a \nspecific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, \nimpaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -\nanterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or \nmore oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling \n[3]. A v ariety of stress positions and maneuvers can be performed to elicit dynamic instability that is not visible \non standard radiographs [ 4]. Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. \nAdditionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ]. \nIn the past , fluoroscopic observation was used to establish the diagnosis of dynamic wrist inst ability. However, in \nmost practices,  fluoroscopy is used either for g uidance during wrist injections  or as an adjunct to arthrography.  \nPercutaneous aspiration of the wrist \u2014which is indicated in cases of suspected septic arthritis or to assess for intra-\narticular crystals\u2014can be carried out with either fluoroscopic or ultrasound (US) guidance  if needed . \nScintigraphy  \nBone scintigraphy has been used for diagnosing occult wrist fractures and as a screening procedure in patients \nwith wrist pain and negative radi ographs. However, while it is sensitive to bone abnormalities, scintigraphy \nsuffers from a lack of specificity [6 ]. Furthermore, bone scans cannot detect soft -tissue abnormalities  such as  \nlesions of the ligaments, tendons, and cartilage, all of which are often responsible for chronic wrist pain.  \nArthrography  \nConventional (x-ray) arthrography can be performed with contrast injection into the radiocarpal joint al one or into \nthe radiocarpal, mi dcarpal, and distal radioulnar joints ( 3-phase technique) for the diagnosis of triangular \nfibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tear and intrinsic ligament perforations. A recent meta -analysis found only \nmoderate pooled sensitivity (76%) for the detection of full -thickness TFCC tears (82% for 3 -phase technique and \n72% for single -injection arthrograms)  [7]. However, arthrography is unable to reliably show the size, shape, and \nstability of TFCC defects and is insensitive to partial-thickness tears. Similarly, while conventional arthrography can be used to diagnose full -thickness defects in the intrinsic intercarpal ligaments, it is unable to identify which \ncomponents of those ligaments are affected, to distinguish degenerative from traumatic lesions, to find partial-\nthickness ligament tears, to demonstrate abnormalities of the extrinsic ligaments, or to show extra-articular \n \naPrincipal Author,  Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri.", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 16 Chronic Wrist Pain  Arthrography  Wrist  \nOnce a scaphoid fracture is identified, Radiographic arthrography does not contribute to the evaluation for \ncomplications of the fracture.  \nVariant 12: Chronic wrist pain.

Next \nstudy. \nUS Wrist \nSeveral meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the \ncarpal  tunnel  inlet) is highly accurate for identifying carpal  tunnel syndrome  diagnosed clinically or with the \ncombination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US \nvaries depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the \nmeasurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary \nexamination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel \nsyndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal \ntunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, \nclinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of \ncarpal tunnel syndrome. US may be appropriate in cases where this initial evaluation is equivocal.  \nMRI Wrist  \nHistorically, carpal tunnel syndrome has been diagnosed based on clinical signs and sympt oms and confirmed by \nthe results of electrodiagnostic studies [67]. MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in cases in which this  \ninitial evaluation is equivocal. The MRI findings that have been reported in wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome \u2014\nincluding nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing\u2014may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value \nin patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68]. In rare cases of secondary carpal tunnel syndrome, MRI may identify \na mass lesion compressing the median nerve. There is some evidence that the length of T2 hyperintensity in the \nmedian nerve can help prognosticate the success of surgery [69] and that the shape and signal of the nerve predict \nclinical response to a steroid injection in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome [70 ].

MRI is useful for diagnosing infectious and noninfectious tenosynovitis in \nboth the flexor and extensor wrist compartments [46]. Occult ganglion cysts are also easily identified with MRI, \nbut some authors recommend use of IV contrast to distinguish ganglia from synovitis [ 47]. For noncystic soft-\ntissue masses, MRI may demonstrate findings that are diagnostic for certain benign conditions (eg, lipomas, \nhemangiomas, benign nerve sheath tumors), and can stage the extent of involvement for nonspecific masses ( see \nthe ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae topic on \u201c Soft-Tissue Masses \u201d [48]). \nUS Wrist  \nWrist US or MRI (without or without  and with IV contrast) are alternative initial examinations that are usually \nappropriate in this setting.

In patients with persistent symptoms thought to be due to an occult wrist \nfracture, MRI can be used as an alternative to presumptive casting and repeat radiographs [ 12].

The utility of MRI in the detection of radiographically occult Chopart \nfractures has been demonstrated by Almeida et al [64] . Baker et al [71]  analyzed 31 occult fractures involving the \nankle and foot in h ockey players,  finding five occult fractures in the foot, all of which involved the navicular bone. \nPierre -Jerome et al [72] found 79% of cuboid fractures in the diabetic population that were radiographically occult \nusing MRI. MRI is also useful in the detection of occult fractures involving the fifth metatarsal bone (Jones fracture) \nand the subtalar join t [65,73] . There is no evidence in the literature supporting the routine use of contrast in the \ndiagnosi s of occult fractures.  \nMRI has replaced bone scans in the evaluation of symptomatic accessory ossicles. MRI allows optimal visualization \nof the bone marrow within the ossicle and visualization of the synchondrosis. Accessory ossicles may also be \nassociated  with tendon pathology, which is also well assessed on MRI [74]. MRI allows clear demonstration of the \nfindings often associated with posterior ankle impingement syndrome [75]. Contrast administration is not routinely \nperformed when assessing symptomatic accessory ossicles on MRI; however, contrast within a disrupted \nsynchondrosis may be demonstrated on MR arthrography stu dies [69]. \nUS Foot   \nAlthough not routinely performed, previous studies have demonstrated the role of US in the detection of occult foot \nfractures. On US, these can be seen as cortical irregularities and are frequently associated with soft -tissue injury in \nthe acute or subacute setting. Wang et al [76]  demonstrated 24 cases of radiographically occult ankle and foot \nfractures in 268 patients. Of these, foot fractures were found most frequently in the calcaneus and metatarsals, and \nless frequently in the navicular, cuboid , and cuneiform bones.  \nOn US, several findings have been reported in cases of painful accessory ossicles, including patients with posterior \nankle impingement syndrome ; however , optimal characterization of the synchondrosis is difficult on US [62] . High -\nresolution US offers some advantages over other imagin g modalities because it allows dynamic exploration of the \nfoot with further assessment of stability of the synchondrosis and tendon tears when present as well as direct clinical \ncorrelation and comparative evaluation with the asymptomatic foot [77] .

When  metal  is present  in or near the area of interest,  there is significant  loss of image  resolution  that is due  \nto a beam -hardening artifact  [13]. Dual -energy CT may be useful for metal artifact reduction if available. With  \nhigh-resolution multiplanar  imaging,  CT is able to delineate the anatomic  extent  of soft-tissue  infections.  Contrast  \nis preferred  for the evaluation  of soft-tissue  infection  and delineation  of fluid  collections  [16]. \nMRI Foot  \nMRI with or without  enhancement  demonstrates  excellent  soft-tissue contrast  and sensitivity  to marrow  \nabnormalities  [18,19] with high-resolution detail  in multiple  anatomic planes.  The likelihood of osteomyelitis  \nwithout  an associated  wound  or ulceration  is extremely  low. MRI with or without  enhancement  is a good \nmodality  to identify  other  potential sources of pain in this variant , such as soft-tissue infections,  tumors  and \nabscesses,  early  neuropathic  arthropathy,  or subtle  fractures.  Normal  marrow  signal  reliably  excludes  \nosteomyelitis  [20]. Positive  cases of osteomyelitis  demonst rate decreased  T1-weighted  bone  marrow  signal  and \nincreased  signal  on fluid -sensitive  sequences [21,22]. Some  authors  suggest  increased  T2-weighted  bone  marrow  \nsigna l may represent  early  osteomyelitis  or be a predictor  of later development  of osteomyelitis, even  in the \nsetting  of a normal  T1-weighted  signal  [2]. MRI with or without  enhancement  is often  the modality  of choice in \nthis variant  because of its  high sensitivity  for osteomyelitis  [23-25 ]. MRI with or without  IV contrast  can detect  \nthe earliest  findings  of neuropathic  arthropathy,  such as marrow  edema  and trabecular  microfractures [17,26]. A \nnegative  MRI indicates that acute neuropathic  arthropathy  is unlike ly [27]. MRI may be limited  by artifact  \nsecondary  to orthopedic  hardware.  \nPerhaps as important  as detecting  osteomyelitis, the structural  definition  and high spatial  resolution  multiplanar  \nimages are important  for evaluating  the extent  of osseous  involvement  and the location  and size of drainable  fluid  \ncollections  for surgical  planning  [28]. The use of gadolinium  contrast  is useful  to determine  fluid  \ncollection/abscesses,  sinus  tracts,  and devitalized  regions.  The \u201cghost  sign\u201d  on postcontrast  images  may reveal  \nosteomyelitis  superimposed on neuropathic  arthropathy.

However,  MRI  without  IV contrast  is still highly  sensitive  in detecting  local  \nrecurrence  of soft tissue  tumor  because  of an inherent  soft tissue  contrast  of MRI  and therefore  is still of benefit.  \nRadiography  Area  of Interest  \nIn rare instances  of a primary  soft tissue  tumor  that produces  osseous  or chondroid  matrix , there  may be limited  \nbenefit  of radiography  area of interest  for detecting  local  recurrence,  but in general  this modality  is usually  not \nhelpful  for most  patients.

MRI is useful for diagnosing infectious and noninfectious tenosynovitis in \nboth the flexor and extensor wrist compartments [46]. Occult ganglion cysts are also easily identified with MRI, \nbut some authors recommend use of IV contrast to distinguish ganglia from synovitis [ 47]. For noncystic soft-\ntissue masses, MRI may demonstrate findings that are diagnostic for certain benign conditions (eg, lipomas, \nhemangiomas, benign nerve sheath tumors), and can stage the extent of involvement for nonspecific masses ( see \nthe ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae topic on \u201c Soft-Tissue Masses \u201d [48]). \nUS Wrist  \nWrist US or MRI (without or without  and with IV contrast) are alternative initial examinations that are usually \nappropriate in this setting. US  is useful for examining extra -articular soft tissue s, such as suspected ganglion cysts \n[17],  with an accuracy similar to that  of MRI.  \nCT Wrist  \nThere is no support in the literature for CT in the initial diagnosis of a palpable mass or suspected ganglion cyst \nwith normal or nonspecific radiologic findings. CT may have a role in cases in which calcification or ossification \nis demo nstrated radiologically, or in the staging of a lesion that is first evaluated by MRI or US , but CT with or \nwithout IV contrast are usually not appropriate initial examinations for a suspected soft -tissue mass.  \nMR Arthrography  Wrist  \nMR arthrography is not routinely used to evaluate a palpable mass or ganglion cyst.  \nCT Arthrography  Wrist  \nCT arthrography is not routinely used to evaluate a palpable mass or ganglion cyst.  \nBone Scan  Wrist  \nBone scan is not routinely used to evaluate a palpable mass or ganglion c yst. \nArthrography  Wrist  \nRadiographic arthrography  is not routinely used to evaluate a palpable mass or ganglion cyst . \nVariant 10: Chronic wrist pain. Suspect occult fracture or stress fracture. Radiographs nondiagnostic. \nNext study.  \nMRI Wrist  \nEither MRI without I V contrast or CT without IV contrast is usually appropriate in this scenario. MRI is highly \nsensitive to changes in bone marrow composition, and thus is frequently used to identify radiographically occult \nacute fractures throughout the skeleton, including in the wrist (see the ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae topic on \n\u201cAcute Hand and Wrist Trauma\u201d [49]). In patients with persistent symptoms thought to be due to an occult wrist \nfracture, MRI can be used as an alternative to presumptive casting and repeat radiographs [ 12]. MRI is also \nsensitive to stress fractures and stress injuries of the physes, for example, in gymnasts [50].  IV contrast does not \nadd to the examination and is usually not appropriate.  \nCT Wrist  \nEither CT without IV contrast or MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate in this scenario. CT can provide high-detail imaging of bone cortex a nd trabeculae and thus can be used to identify radiographically occult  \nfractures and stress fractures. Acquisition times are shorter for CT compared to MRI, and CT may be easier to \nperform in patients who are casted. However, MRI\u2019s sensitivity for bone bru ises and soft -tissue injuries is greater \nthan CT. In specific circumstances\u2014like suspected fractures of the hook of the hamate\u2014 CT may be preferable to \nMRI.  IV contrast does not add to the examination and is usually not appropriate.  \nRadiography Wrist  \nIf not  obtained as part of the initial radiographic series, additional views such as a carpal tunnel or semipronated \noblique projection  (a \u201cscaphoid view\u201d) may show an otherwise radiographically  occult fracture, and may be \nappropriate . \nBone Scan  Wrist  \nBone scans are frequently positive for occult fractures by the time of clinical presentation , typically  1 to 2 weeks \nbefore radiographs.", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 12 Chronic Wrist Pain  CT Wrist  \nCT, with or without IV  contrast, is not routinely used to further e valuate ulnar -sided chronic wrist pain when \nradiographs are normal or nonspecific.  \nBone Scan  Wrist  \nBone scan is not routinely used to further evaluate ulnar -sided chronic wrist pain when radiographs are normal or \nnonspecific . \nVariant 6: Radial -sided chroni c wrist pain.  Radiographs normal or nonspecific . Next study.   \nMRI Wrist  \nMRI is accurate for diagnosing scapholunate ligament tears [8,10,38,39], and noncontrast -enhanced MRI is \nusually appropriate in this scenario . IV contrast seldom provides added benefit in patients w ith radial -sided wrist \npain but may increase sensitivity for ligament lesions if MR arthrography is desired but direct joint injection is not \nfeasible.  \nMR Arthrography  Wrist  \nDirect MR arthrography (with contrast injection either into the radiocarpal joint or into all three  compartments of \nthe wrist) may be appropriate in this scenario; the examination has higher sensitivity than noncontrast -enhanced \nMRI\u2014even when performed at 3.0 T \u2014for diagnosis of complete and incomplete scapholunate and lunotriquetral \nligament tears [3 ,8,38]. For the scapholunate ligament, direct MR  arthrography also allows more accurate \ndetermination of which specific segments of the ligament are torn compared to conventional MRI [43], which has \nimportant biomechanical implications for wrist stability. Direct MR arthrography also has an advantage over \nnoncontrast -enhanced MRI for diagnosing extrinsic ligament abnormalities [44].  \nCT Arthrography  Wrist  \nThe accuracy of CT arthrography and MR arthrography are similar for lesions of the scapholunate ligament [8 ]. \nCompared to conventional MRI, CT arthrography may be more sensitive for tears of the biomechanically \nimportant dorsal ligament fibers [16]. In contrast to MRI and MR arthrography, CT arthrography is less sensitive \nfor diagnosis of extra -articular findings (like ganglion cysts and tendon disorders) t hat can cause radial -sided pain.  \nCT arthrography may be appropriate in this scenario.  \nCT Wrist  \nCT, with or without IV contrast,  is not routinely used to further evaluate chronic radial -sided wrist pain when \nradiographs are normal or nonspecific.  \nUS Wrist  \nWhile some investigators have tried high-resolution US with or  without arthrography for diagnosing intrinsic \nligament [41,42], its sensitivity in comparison to MRI, MR arthrography, and CT arthrography is unknown. \nAdditionally, imaging with US is largely limited to the dorsal fibers of the ligaments [42]. US may be appropriate \nin cases of suspected de Quervain disease (stenosing tenosynovitis of the abductor pollicis longus and extensor \npollicis brevis tendon compartment), where preoperative identification of a septum or subcompartmentalization \nwithin the first dorsal compartment with US may affect surgical management [18,19]. US may be appropriate in \npatients with radial -sided pain in cases where extra-articular pathology is the primary consideration.  \nArthrography  Wrist  \nConventional (x-ray) arthrography has largely been supplanted by CT arthrogra phy and MR arthrography because \nthese cross-sectional studies are better able to predict which fibers of the scapholunate ligament are torn and \nwhether any repairable fibers remain , both of which are important features that affect operative management . \nAdditionally, while fibrocartilage and ligament perforations are moderately associated with ulnar -sided wrist pain, \nthere is a poor correlation between ligament lesions and radial -sided pain [45]. Furthermore, conventional \narthrography is unable to show extra -articular findings (like ganglion cysts and tendon disorders) that can cause \nradial -sided pain, further limiting its usefulness in  this patient population .", "ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 9 Soft Tissue  Masses thus would not warrant  biopsy.  Therefore,  diagnostic  imaging  that includes  comprehensive characterization  of the \nmass  should routinely  be performed  before  biopsy.  In fact, the National  Comprehensive  Cancer  Network  Clinical  \nPractice Guidelines in Oncology for Soft Tissue Sarcoma state that biopsy should  be performed  only after adequate \nimaging  [24]. \nUS Area  of Interest  With  IV Contrast  \nAlthough prospective studies have  emerged  suggesting  that US is accurate  in the discrimination  of benign from  \nmalignant  soft tissue masses,  the number  of malignancies in these studies was limited  [16,28] .

In the evaluation  of suspected  tumors,  contrast  imaging  is especially  useful  in \ndistinguishing vascularized  from  potentially  necrotic regions  of the tumor.  With  modern  CT technology,  \ncalcification  can usually  be distinguished from  vascular  enhancement.  \nOf note, d ual-energy  CT is a relatively  newer  technology that has shown  utility  in evaluation  of soft tissue masses.  \nUsing  the differences in energy  attenuation  of soft tissue at 80 kVp and 140 kVp,  this technique  can allow  \nreconstruction  of virtual noncontrast  CT images as well as significantly  reduce metal  artifact  in the assessment  of \nmetal  implants,  improving the diagnostic  value  of imaging  in the surrounding soft tissues [49,50] . It has also shown  \napplication  in the assessment  of marrow  edema [51,52]  and has been  investigated  in the distinction  of marrow  \nedema from  intramedullary  tumor  invasion [53]. Furthermore,  spectral  CT is emerging  as a useful  tool for \ndistinguishing benign from  malignant  soft tissue masses [54]. \nCT Area  of Interest  Without and With  IV Contrast  \nDual-phase CT without  and with IV contrast  as the next imaging  study for the evaluation  of a soft tissue mass  may \nbe appropriate when MRI is con traindicated . Although single -phase CT with IV contrast is considered most \nappropriate in this clinical scenario given the advent of virtual noncontrast reconstruction with modern dual -source \nCT scanners [31] , a traditional CT without and with  IV contrast can be helpful  for characterization of mineralization \nin an anatomically complex area.  \nCT Area  of Interest  Without IV Contrast  \nThe l iterature  does not support  the use of a single -phase CT without  IV contrast  as the next imaging  study  for the \nevaluation  of a soft tissue mass  when  MRI is contraindicated.  However,  single -phase CT with IV contrast  is a useful  \ntechnique  for the evaluation  of patients  who cannot  undergo  MRI and is the modality  of choice  in this scenario  [29]. \nIn the evaluation  of suspected  tumors,  contrast  imaging  is especially  useful  in distinguishing  vascularized  from  \npotentially  necrotic regions  of the tumor.

For malignant/metastatic  disease,  MRI is \npreferred  as both bony/marrow  involvement  and neural  compression  from  epidural  tumor  are visualized  with high \nspatial  resolution  [62]. In a patient  with suspected  spinal  infection, MRI without  and with IV contrast  is preferred  \nbecause of its  high sensitivity  and specificity. MRI can localize  the site of infection  and assess the extent  of \nextradural/epidural  and paravertebral  involvement  [65,67] , and is helpful  to distinguish  abscess from  phlegmon \n[67]. \nMRI Lumbar Spine Without IV Contrast  \nMRI lumbar  spine  without  IV can be a sufficient  imaging  study  if there is low risk of epidural  and/or  intraspinal  \ndisease.

Radiographs show Bankart  or Hill-Sachs lesion. Next imaging  study. \nBankart and Hill -Sachs lesions are common findings associated with transient shoulder dislocation. Bankart \nlesions have a particularly high association with transient shoulder dislocations [50], and a transient shoulder \ndislocation should be presumed if a Bankart lesion is present. A close association exists bet ween Bankart and \nHill-Sachs lesions [ 51], and one should be sought out whenever the other is identified on radiographs. Both \nBankart and Hill -Sachs lesions can present as nonosseous  lesions that are occult on r adiographs and noncontrast \nCT. \nMRI Shoulder  \nSimilar to MR arthrography, noncontrast MRI is comparable to CT in evaluating glenoid and humeral head bone \nloss [12,18]. In general, noncontrast MRI performs well in diagnosing labroligamentous injuries [ 20,52]. \nHowever, noncontrast MRI is considered inferior to MR arthrography for assessing labroligamentous pathology \nfrequently associated with Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions [ 17,19]. Noncontrast MRI is a good alternative to MR \narthrography in the setting of acute injury when significant glenohumeral joint effusion is present to assist in \nvisualization of intra -articular soft -tissue pathology.  \nMR Arthrography  Shoulder  \nMR arthrography is the preferred study for evaluating subacute or chronic Bankart lesions because of  its soft -\ntissue contrast. Multiple studies have shown MR arthrography to be reliable in diagnosing labroligamentous \ninjuries [12,17,52] and superior to noncontrast MRI for this indication [ 17,19]. MR arthrography has been shown \nto be equivalent to CT in the assess ment of glenoid and humeral head bone loss [ 12,18], while being superior to \nCT in assessment of labroligamentous in juries [12]. MR arthrography is also able to delineate humeral head and \nglenoid cartilage, which can be important because some Hill -Sachs lesions affect  cartilage only  [11]. \nCT Shoulder  \nNoncontrast CT has historically been used to assess Hill -Sachs and bony Bankart lesions. However, MRI has \nbeen shown to be equivalent to CT for a ssessing both glenoid and humeral head bone loss [ 12,18,53], and CT is \nlimited in the assessment of cartilaginous Hill -Sachs lesions [11]. In addition, CT cannot assess injury to \nsoft-tissue structures like the labroligamentous complex, which further limits its usefulness in evaluating Bankart \nlesions. CT should be reserved for patients with a contraindication to MRI or patients in whom MRI assessment \nof bone loss is limited.  \nCT Arthrography  Shoulder  \nCT arthrography has sho wn fair agreement between observers and is comparable to MR arthrography in \ndiagnosing Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions [ 12,13].

This \nlesion can be identified by absence of ulnar collateral ligament and the presence of a hypoechoic mass proximal to \nthe apex of the metacarpal tubercle [64].

Jersey finger refers to avulsion injury of flexor digitorum profundus from  insertion at base of distal \nphalanx. In patients with jers ey finger, MRI is commonly used to evaluate the level of tendon retraction, the \nquality of the tendon stump, and the associated injuries including pulley injuries [16]. In clinically equivocal \ncases, MRI may demonstrate injury to the central slip or the extensor hood [ 16]. \nMRI allows for the assessment of pulley system lesions [ 66,67]. MRI can accurately depict the pulley system, \nparticularly the A2 and A4 pulleys, with lower sensitivity for A3 and A5 pulleys [ 70].

Unlike \nCT, MRI shows concomitant ligament  injuries, including tears of the scapholunate ligament, which may affect \nsurgical treatment [26,27]. Despite these advantages,  MRI performed immediately at the time of injury has little \nadded value for determining which patients go on to surgery [ 23]. \nMRI is especially useful in evaluating  hand soft -tissues injuries, including the collateral ligaments, volar plates, \ntendons, and pulleys. For metacarpal and digital fractures, MRI is usually not indicated during acute injury [ 22]. \nThere is no evidence to support the use of MRI with IV contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist trauma.  \nUS Area of Interest  \nUS may have a limited utility  for evaluating bone injuries.

Next imaging \nstudy. \nRadiography Wrist  \nAssessment of carpal instability with conventional radiographs requires careful attention to radiographic \npositioning.  In low -grade injuries, radiographs are usually normal.  Scapholunate diastasis of >4 mm and dorsal til t \nof the lunate of > 10\u00b0 suggests dorsal intercalated segmental instability  [30,31]. Lunotriquetral dias tasis with \nscapholunate angle < 30\u00b0 and capitolunate angle of > 30\u00b0 suggests volar intercalated segmental instability  [30]. \nCT Arthrography  Wrist  \nWhen conventional radiographs do not show carpal malalignment, CT arthrography may be used to diagnose \nligamentous tears,  causing dynamic instability [ 32,33]. There is a g rowing body of literature comparing the \ndiagnostic accuracy of MR I (at 1.5T or 3T), MR arthrography (indirect or direct at 1.5T  or 3T) , and CT \narthrography.  Overall , CT arthrography is reported to have the highest sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.  \nFor the detection of scapholunate ligament tear, CT arthrography has sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of \nnearly 100%.  For the detection of lunotriquetral ligament tear, CT arthrography has approximately 100% \nsensitivity, 80% specificity, and 90% accuracy.  Compared with arthroscopy, CT arthrography has 80%  to 100% \nsensitivity for scapholunate and lunotriquetral ligament tears [ 33-35 ]. \nCompared to MR arthrography,  CT arthrography detects partial ligament tears more accurately, detects articular \ncartilage defects more accurately, and has greater interobserver agreement [ 33]. Both CT arthrography and MR \narthrography have a very high accuracy for diagnosing tears of the scapholunate ligament and lunotriquetral \nligament; both are more  accurate than conventional MRI [ 36]. \nThe accuracy of CT arthrography for extrinsic ligament injuries is unknown [ 37]. \nCT Wrist  \nCT is not indicated in this clinical setting. \nMRI Wrist  \nWhen conventional radiographs do not show carpal malalignment, MRI is commonly used to diagnose \nligamentous tears. In the clinical setting of dynamic instability, MRI or MR arthrography  may be performed .", "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 9 Acute Hand and Wrist Trauma  US allows for assessment of pulley system injuries [ 66,67], particularly the A2 and A4 pulleys, with lower \nsensitivity for A3 and A5 pulleys  [70]. \nBone Scan Hand \nBone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  \nVariant 7: Suspect penetrating trauma with a foreign body in the soft  tissues in the hand or wrist. Initial \nradiographs are negative.  Next imaging study.  \nCT Area of Interest  \nCT has high sensitivity for detection of radiopaque foreign bodies [77, 78]. In case of penetration of foreign body \ninto deep tissues or bone, CT is recommended [ 79]. \nThere are no studies of the hand and wrist. For comparabl e studies regarding  foreign bodies in the feet, CT has \n63% sensitivity and 98% specificity.  CT detection rates depend on the attenuation values of the foreign bodies.  \nCT is superior to MRI in identifying water -rich fresh wood [ 80]. \nMRI Area of Interest  \nMRI has lower sensitivity compared to CT for detection of foreign bodies [ 78,79]. \nFor foreign bodies in the feet, MRI has 58% sensitivity and 100% spe cificity. MRI detection rates depend on the \nassociated susceptibility artifact [ 80]. There are no comparable studies of the hand and wrist.  \nMRI may be useful in certain circumstances,  such as with complicated foreign bodies.  MRI helps identify foreign \nbodies by the presence of air or metal susceptib ility artifact or adjacent edema or fibrosis.  MRI may also be used \nto exclude associated osteomyelitis (see the ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae topic on \u201c Suspected Osteomyelitis, \nSeptic Arthritis, or Soft Tissue Infection (Excluding Spine and Diabetic Foot) \u201d [81]) or abscess [77]. \nIn cases of s uspected traumatic nerve injury of the hand and wrist, MRI with dedicated neu rography sequences \n(eg, diffusion  weighted) ha s shown improved visualization of the injured nerves  [82]. \nUS Area of Interest  \nUS is superior to radiography for detection of radiolucent foreign bodies and is recommended as the first choice \nwhen the foreign body is located within the superficial soft  tissues with no bone around it [ 78,79,83]. \nUS allows for  better  localization of radiopaque foreig n bodies, assessment of tendons and vascular structures, and \nUS-guided removal of the foreign body [77]. \nBone Scan Area of  Interest  \nBone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  \nSummary of R ecommendations \n\u2022 Variant 1: Radiographs area of interest is usually appropriate for the initial imaging of adults with acute \nblunt or penetrating trauma to the hand or wrist.  \n\u2022 Variant 2: Repeat radiographs in 10\u2013 14 days, MRI without IV contrast, or CT without  IV contrast is usually \nappropriate as the next imaging study for adults with acute hand or wrist trauma when initial radiographs are \nnegative or equivocal.

Radiographs normal or nonspecific . Next study.   \nMRI Wrist  \nMRI is accurate for diagnosing scapholunate ligament tears [8,10,38,39], and noncontrast -enhanced MRI is \nusually appropriate in this scenario . IV contrast seldom provides added benefit in patients w ith radial -sided wrist \npain but may increase sensitivity for ligament lesions if MR arthrography is desired but direct joint injection is not \nfeasible.  \nMR Arthrography  Wrist  \nDirect MR arthrography (with contrast injection either into the radiocarpal joint or into all three  compartments of \nthe wrist) may be appropriate in this scenario; the examination has higher sensitivity than noncontrast -enhanced \nMRI\u2014even when performed at 3.0 T \u2014for diagnosis of complete and incomplete scapholunate and lunotriquetral \nligament tears [3 ,8,38]. For the scapholunate ligament, direct MR  arthrography also allows more accurate \ndetermination of which specific segments of the ligament are torn compared to conventional MRI [43], which has \nimportant biomechanical implications for wrist stability. Direct MR arthrography also has an advantage over \nnoncontrast -enhanced MRI for diagnosing extrinsic ligament abnormalities [44].  \nCT Arthrography  Wrist  \nThe accuracy of CT arthrography and MR arthrography are similar for lesions of the scapholunate ligament [8 ]. \nCompared to conventional MRI, CT arthrography may be more sensitive for tears of the biomechanically \nimportant dorsal ligament fibers [16]. In contrast to MRI and MR arthrography, CT arthrography is less sensitive \nfor diagnosis of extra -articular findings (like ganglion cysts and tendon disorders) t hat can cause radial -sided pain.  \nCT arthrography may be appropriate in this scenario.  \nCT Wrist  \nCT, with or without IV contrast,  is not routinely used to further evaluate chronic radial -sided wrist pain when \nradiographs are normal or nonspecific.  \nUS Wrist  \nWhile some investigators have tried high-resolution US with or  without arthrography for diagnosing intrinsic \nligament [41,42], its sensitivity in comparison to MRI, MR arthrography, and CT arthrography is unknown. \nAdditionally, imaging with US is largely limited to the dorsal fibers of the ligaments [42]. US may be appropriate \nin cases of suspected de Quervain disease (stenosing tenosynovitis of the abductor pollicis longus and extensor \npollicis brevis tendon compartment), where preoperative identification of a septum or subcompartmentalization \nwithin the first dorsal compartment with US may affect surgical management [18,19]. US may be appropriate in \npatients with radial -sided pain in cases where extra-articular pathology is the primary consideration.  \nArthrography  Wrist  \nConventional (x-ray) arthrography has largely been supplanted by CT arthrogra phy and MR arthrography because \nthese cross-sectional studies are better able to predict which fibers of the scapholunate ligament are torn and \nwhether any repairable fibers remain , both of which are important features that affect operative management . \nAdditionally, while fibrocartilage and ligament perforations are moderately associated with ulnar -sided wrist pain, \nthere is a poor correlation between ligament lesions and radial -sided pain [45]. Furthermore, conventional \narthrography is unable to show extra -articular findings (like ganglion cysts and tendon disorders) that can cause \nradial -sided pain, further limiting its usefulness in  this patient population ."], ["ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 8 Chronic Foot Pain  MRI Foot  \nMRI allows the visualization of bone marrow edema patterns, which improve s the detection of fractures in cases of \nnegative or inconclusive radiographs [70] . The utility of MRI in the detection of radiographically occult Chopart \nfractures has been demonstrated by Almeida et al [64] . Baker et al [71]  analyzed 31 occult fractures involving the \nankle and foot in h ockey players,  finding five occult fractures in the foot, all of which involved the navicular bone. \nPierre -Jerome et al [72] found 79% of cuboid fractures in the diabetic population that were radiographically occult \nusing MRI. MRI is also useful in the detection of occult fractures involving the fifth metatarsal bone (Jones fracture) \nand the subtalar join t [65,73] . There is no evidence in the literature supporting the routine use of contrast in the \ndiagnosi s of occult fractures.  \nMRI has replaced bone scans in the evaluation of symptomatic accessory ossicles. MRI allows optimal visualization \nof the bone marrow within the ossicle and visualization of the synchondrosis. Accessory ossicles may also be \nassociated  with tendon pathology, which is also well assessed on MRI [74]. MRI allows clear demonstration of the \nfindings often associated with posterior ankle impingement syndrome [75]. Contrast administration is not routinely \nperformed when assessing symptomatic accessory ossicles on MRI; however, contrast within a disrupted \nsynchondrosis may be demonstrated on MR arthrography stu dies [69]. \nUS Foot   \nAlthough not routinely performed, previous studies have demonstrated the role of US in the detection of occult foot \nfractures. On US, these can be seen as cortical irregularities and are frequently associated with soft -tissue injury in \nthe acute or subacute setting. Wang et al [76]  demonstrated 24 cases of radiographically occult ankle and foot \nfractures in 268 patients. Of these, foot fractures were found most frequently in the calcaneus and metatarsals, and \nless frequently in the navicular, cuboid , and cuneiform bones.  \nOn US, several findings have been reported in cases of painful accessory ossicles, including patients with posterior \nankle impingement syndrome ; however , optimal characterization of the synchondrosis is difficult on US [62] . High -\nresolution US offers some advantages over other imagin g modalities because it allows dynamic exploration of the \nfoot with further assessment of stability of the synchondrosis and tendon tears when present as well as direct clinical \ncorrelation and comparative evaluation with the asymptomatic foot [77] . Power Doppler US has proven useful in \nidentifying increased blood supply in the setting of ankle impingement [78,79] . \nVariant 6: Chronic foot pain. Entrapment s yndromes.

Overall \nsensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs \nin the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral \nand oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar \ncoalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs \non the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have \nbeen found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable \nmethods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  \nRadiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review \nby Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for \nradiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.  \nRadiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  \nusually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, \nosteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite \nversus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess \nwith radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton\u2019s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other \ncauses of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg\u2019s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals \nor soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . \nThough radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in \npatients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The \ncombination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a \nspecificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15]. \nUS Foot  \nUltrasound (US) is usually not indicate d as the first imaging  study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain, but may \nbe performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of pathologic conditions of the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, \nand other conditions such as tarsal tunnel syndrome, Morton\u2019s  neuroma , plantar plate tears,  and intermetatarsal \nbursitis. \nVariant 2: Persistent posttraumatic foot pain. Radiographs negative or equivocal. Clinical concern includes \ncomplex regional pain syndrome type I. Next imaging study.  \n3-Phase Bone Scan Foot  \nA 3-phase bone scan may be useful in cases of suspected complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type I reflex \nsympathetic dystrophy , and several imaging findings have been described.", "ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 7 Acute Trauma to the Foot  injuries  in midtarsal  (Chopart) sprains,  which  frequently  accompany  acute ankle  injuries  [52,53] . If radiographs  \nare negative,  MRI can be obtained in select  patients  with forefoot  pain because of its increased  sensitivity  for the \nearly  detection  of metatarsal  head  subchondral  fracture  [54]. \nLisfranc  Injury  \nMRI has been  advocated  as a sensitive diagnostic  test in evaluation  of Lisfranc ligamentous  complex  (especially  \nif the patient  is not able to bear weight),  and 3-D volumetric  acquisitions  have  proven superiority  over orthogonal  \nproton  density  fat-suppressed  imaging [33,38,41- 45]. There is a high correlation  between  MRI and intraoperative  \nfindings  for an unstable  Lisfranc injury  [44]. In the patient  with a suspected  Lisfranc injury  and normal  \nradiographs,  the literature  supports  further advanced  imaging  by MRI  and CT [21,33,43,46] . \nTurf Toe and Plantar  Plate Injuries \nMRI is the preferred  imaging method for evaluating  suspected  \u201cturf  toe\u201d and lesser  metatarsal  plantar  plate  injury  \nby directly  evaluating  the soft-tissue structures of the capsuloligamentous  complex  as well as assessing  chondral  \nand osteochondral  lesions [29,55,56] . \nAcute  Tendinous  Rupture  \nMRI tends  to be used as a screening  tool when  one is not certain  of the specific tendon injury  or if concomitant  \nosseous injury  is suspected.  Both  MRI and US have  been  shown  to be sensitive  for the diagnosis  of acute tendon  \nrupture  or dislocation  in the foot [39]. In a surgically  confirmed  study,  MRI was shown  to have  83% sensitivity  \nfor diagnosing tendon and ligament  traumatic  injuries  about  the foot and ankle  [37]. \nUS Foot  \nThe importance  of focused  US examinations  is emphasized  in the literature  [57,58] . Protocol -based  US evaluation  \nidentified  97.4%  of symptomatic abnormalities  in the distal  extremities  (including the foot),  with additional  \naccuracy  obtained  with focused  examination  [57]. \nLisfranc  Injury  \nAlthough  the literature  evidence is limited, US may hold promise  as an alternative method to accurately  evaluate \nfor a significant  Lisfranc injury  providing direct  and indirect  assessment  of the Lisfranc ligamentous  complex  as \nwell as dynamic  evaluation  with weightbearing  as demonstrated  in a series of 10 patients  [59].  Dorsal  component  \nof Lisfranc ligament  is amenable to direct  US evaluation  [59,60] , although this structure may not be critical  for \nstability  for the Lisfranc joint [20,32] . The physiologic  deformation of the dorsal  Lisfranc ligament  resulting  from  \nfunctional  loading emphasized  the need  for normative  US data as well as proper  positioning  when  bilateral  \nevaluation  is performed  [61,62] . \nTurf Toe and Plantar  Plate Injuries \nUS in the sagittal  plane  best visualizes  the plantar  plate  between  the flexor  tendon and hyaline  cartilage of the \nmetatarsal  head  [63]. US has shown  a 96% sensitivity  compared  with 87% sensitivity  for MRI  for the detection  of \nlesser  toe plantar  plate  tears;  however , both modalities  have  poor specificity  [64].  \nAcute  Tendinous  Rupture  \nBoth  MRI and US have  been  shown  to be sensitive for the diagnosis  of acute tendon  rupture  or dislocation  in the \nfoot [39].
