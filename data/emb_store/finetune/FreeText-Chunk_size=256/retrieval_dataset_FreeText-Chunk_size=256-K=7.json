Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type \nresult in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men \n[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs \nwill continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of \nlife following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1].

Moreover, these pelvic fractures may occur in isolation \nor concomitant with a fracture of the proximal femur [28]. Therefore, it has been recommended that th e \nradiographic series include both the AP view of the pelvis along with orthogonal views of the symptomatic hip \n[31]. The inclusion of a pelvis radiograph also allows for comparison of potential abnormalities to the \ncontralateral asymptomatic side. For these reasons, an AP view of the pelvis with a cross-table lateral view of the \nsymptomatic hip is the standard approach at many institutions , whereas some will include three views: an AP \nview of the pelvis, a separate AP v iew of the symptomatic hip, and the cross-table lateral view.
