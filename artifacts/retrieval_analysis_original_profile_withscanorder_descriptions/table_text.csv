Variant 6: Traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs normal.  Physical examination and history consistent 
with dislocation event  or instability . Next imaging study. 
Shoulder dislocation or instability is most co mmon in the anterior direction. Younger patients are more likely to 
have labroligamentous injury and persistent instability after dislocation compared with older patients [54]. Older 
patients are more likely to have rotator cuff tears in association with shoulder dislocation [ 55]. Coexisting 
humeral avulsion of the glenohumeral ligament and significant glenoid bone loss have been found in up to 10% of 
patients with recurrent shoulder instability [ 56], which underscores the need to assess both osseous and 
labroligamentous pathology in patients with shoulder dislocation or instability. Glenoid morphology and bone 
loss can play a significant factor in recurrent shoulder dislocations [15, 16,57], which may require bone grafting in 
order to restore stability [ 57].

ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 8 Shoulder Pain –Traumatic  Variant 2: Traumatic shoulder pain. Nonlocalized shoulder pain. Negative radiographs . Next imaging 
study. 
Appropriately positioned  radiographs can exclude shoulder dislocation and most displaced fractures as the 
etiology for post -traumatic shoulder pain. In the setting of normal shoulder radiographs, the most common causes 
of post -traumatic shoulder pain are soft -tissue injuries such  as rotator cuff and labral tears.  
MRI Shoulder  
Noncontrast MRI is a reasonable imaging study in the setting of acute nonlocalized traumatic shoulder pain and 
noncontributory radiographs. In the acute trauma setting, noncontrast MRI may be preferred to MR arthrography , 
as acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint effusion for assessment of intra -articular 
soft-tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic 
pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [34,35]. MRI is also sensitive for diagnosing bone marrow 
contusion and has  been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries in pediatric patients [ 36,37]. 
MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography has been found to be superior to noncontrast MRI in the diagnosis of labroligamentous and 
partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [17,19]. In the acute trauma setting, however, noncontrast MRI may be 
preferred to MR arthrography because acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint 
effusion for assessment of intra-arti cular soft -tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing 
extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [ 34,35]. MRI is also sensitive 
for diagnosing bone marrow contusion and has been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries

Most soft -tissue injuries (such as labral tears and rotator cuff tears) can undergo a period of 
conservative management prior to considering surgery. However, in addition to the specific imaging findings 
related to a traumatic injury, indications and timing of surgical treatment of many traumatic shoulder injuries are 
dependent on patient age, comorbidities, current activity level, and expected activity level.  
Imaging of chronic shoulder pain is beyond the scope of this topic  and is cove red in the  ACR Appropriateness

Discussion o f Procedures  by Variant  
Variant 1:  Traumatic shoulder pain. Any etiology . Initial imaging . 
Radiography Shoulder  
Radiographs are the preferred initial study performed in the setting of traumatic shoulder pain . They can delineate 
shoulder malalignment and most shoulder fractures [ 4,5]. A standard set of shoulder radiographs for trauma 
should include at least three  views: anterior -posterior (AP) views in internal and external rotation and an axillary 
or scapula-Y view. Axillary or scapula-Y views are vital in evaluating traumatic shoulder injuries as 
acromioclavicular and glenohumeral dislocations can be misclassified on AP  views [6,7]. Radiographs provide 
good delineation of bony anatomy to assess for fracture and appropriate shoulder alignment, which are the two 
primary concerns in management of acute traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs should also be performed upright 
since malalignment of the shoul der can be under -represented on supine radiographs [ 4]. Additional views, such as 
the Bernageau view, have been sho wn to be effective in demonstrating the degree of bone loss of the glenoid or 
humeral head [ 8].

ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 14 Shoulder Pain –Traumatic  CT Shoulder  
Noncontrast CT is unable to assess rotator cuff pathology in the acute setting.  
US Shoulder  
In the post -traumatic setting, US  has been shown to detect abnormalities, including rotator cuff tears [ 25]. In 
general, US can have high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of full -thickness rotator cuff tears [ 70-72] . 
There is conflicting evidence on the ability of US  to diagnose partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [17,22,24,44,72]. 
Similarly, although interobserver agreement in detection of full -thickness rotator cuff tears can be high, it is much 
more variable for detection of partial -thickness tears [73,74]. 
FDG -PET/CT  Skull Base to Mid-Thigh 
FDG-PET/CT is not routinely used  for describing  rotator cuff tears.  Indirect identification of symptomatic rotator 
cuff tears has been described on FDG-PET/CT  by decreased radiotracer activity in the muscles of the torn tendons 
and increased activity of surrounding shoulder girdle muscles due to muscle recruitment  [28,29]. However, FDG-
PET/CT  cannot describe the extent of rotator cuff tear or degree of rotator cuff atrophy, which are relevant for 
clinical management.  
Bone Scan  Shoulder  
Bone scintigraphy is not routinely used  for describing rotator cuff tears . Increased radiotracer activity has been 
associated with symptomatic rotator cuff tears [33]. However, bone scintigraphy cannot describe the extent of 
rotator cuff tear or degree of rotator cuff atrophy, which are re levant for clinical management.

demonstrate evolving  structural  changes or bone  formation,  although these changes occur  slowly  over time at the

imaging  features of axSpA  in the sacroiliac joints  on MRI as indicated  by sensitivities  of all studies to varying 
degrees below  100%  [22], and therefore  some  patients may need  further imaging  evaluation  with MRI given that it 
is the imaging  modality  of choice for the diagnosis  of axSpA  [1,3,19,22] . Studies  have  shown  widely varying  
degrees of isolated  spinal  involvement  on MRI in axSpA  ranging from  1% to 49% [19,59-63,114,115] . Therefore,  
imag ing of the spine  is beneficial  for patients  in whom  there is suspicion  for axSpA  but imaging  of the sacroiliac 
joints  has been  negative.  Some  authors  have  shown  the utility  of using  whole -spine  or whole -body  MRI to identify  
the burden of disease rather  than selecting  specific areas of the spine  to image  because findings  may be potentially  
isolated  to any portion of the spine  [10,59,63,89,114,120-122] .

ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 6 Acute Hand and Wrist Trauma  Like CT, MRI shows intra -articular extension of distal radius fractures more frequently than radiography.  Unlike 
CT, MRI shows concomitant ligament  injuries, including tears of the scapholunate ligament, which may affect 
surgical treatment [26,27]. Despite these advantages,  MRI performed immediately at the time of injury has little 
added value for determining which patients go on to surgery [ 23]. 
MRI is especially useful in evaluating  hand soft -tissues injuries, including the collateral ligaments, volar plates, 
tendons, and pulleys. For metacarpal and digital fractures, MRI is usually not indicated during acute injury [ 22]. 
There is no evidence to support the use of MRI with IV contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist trauma.  
US Area of Interest  
US may have a limited utility  for evaluating bone injuries. Christiansen et al  [28] reported 47% sensitivity and 
61% specificity of US  for the detection of scaphoid fractures . They concluded that US  is not suitable for the early 
diagnosis of scaphoid fracture.  In contrast, Hauger et al  [29] reported that using cortical disruption as a diagnostic 
criterion on US is an accurate sign for detecting occult fractures of the scaphoid waist. Further study of US  for the 
diagnosis of occult fractures is needed . 
Bone Scan Area of  Interest  
Bone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  
Variant 3: Acute wrist fracture on radiographs. Suspect wrist tendon or ligament trauma. Next imaging 
study. 
Radiography Wrist  
Assessment of carpal instability with conventional radiographs requires careful attention to radiographic 
positioning.  In low -grade injuries, radiographs are usually normal.  Scapholunate diastasis of >4 mm and dorsal til t 
of the lunate of > 10° suggests dorsal intercalated segmental instability  [30,31].

ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 11 Chronic Wrist Pain  CT Wrist  
While CT with IV contrast enhancement can depict abscesses, it is usually not appropriate  for evaluation of 
suspected wrist infections.  
CT Arthrography  Wrist  
CT arthrography is not routinely used to eval uate suspected wrist infection.  
US Wrist  
There may be a role for US in the staging of infections (for example, to delineate the location and e xtent of soft -
tissue abscesses) after aspiration has been performed.  Alternatively, US may be used in conjunction with 
aspiration as a method to first identify collections and then as the imaging method to guide aspiration.  
Bone Scan  Wrist  
Bone scan is not  routinely used to eval uate suspected chronic wrist infection.  
Arthrography  Wrist  
Radiographic arthrography  is not routinely used to eval uate suspected wrist infection.  
Variant 5:  Ulnar -sided chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or nonspecific . Next study.  
MRI Wrist  
Both traumatic and degenerative lesions of the TFCC can produce chronic, ulnar -sided wrist pain . MRI is highly 
accurate for lesions involving the radial (central) zone of the disc, especially with the use of high -resolution fast 
spin-echo or 3-D grad ient-recalled pulse sequences [36]. There is some evidence suggesting that MRI performed 
with a 3.0 T system is even more accurate than MRI performed with a 1.5 T system for TFCC lesions [37], but 
there are no studies comparing the accuracy of the two field s trengths in the same patients. The sensitivity for 
tears of the ulnar attachment of the disc and the peripheral attachments (the ulnocarpal ligaments) are only fair 
with noncontrast -enhanced wrist MRI [ 12,36]. IV contrast seldom provides added benefit in patients with ulnar -
sided wrist pain but may increase sensitivity for TFCC lesions if MR arthrography is desired but direct joint 
injection is not feasible.

Variant 2: Suspect acute hand or wrist trauma. Initial radiographs nega tive or equivocal. Next imaging 
study. 
Radiograph y Area of Interest  
In patients with clinical suspicion of hand or wrist fracture and negative radiographs, one option is to place the 
patient in a short arm cast and repeat the radiographs at 10  to 14 days [ 13]. The downside of this option is that it 
results in delay of diagnosis , which may lead to functional impairment . 
CT Area of Interest  
When the initial radiographs are equivocal, CT  without IV contrast  is commonly used to exclude or confirm 
suspected wrist fractures [18]. CT shows intra-articular extension of distal radius fractures more frequently than 
radiography.  Three-dimensional reconstructions can be particularly helpful in preoperative planning for complex 
articular injuries  [7,8]. 
CT should be used to exclude an occult fracture of the upper extremity. Unlike MRI, CT cannot evaluate for 
concomitant ligamentous injuries  [19-21 ]. 
CT is useful in diagnosing injuries that are difficult to recognize on radiographs, such as carpometacarpal joint 
fracture dislocations. For metacarpal and digital  fractures, CT is usually not indicated during acute injury [ 22]. 
There is no evidence to support the use of CT with IV contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist trauma.  
MRI Area o f Interest  
When initial radiographs are normal but there is high clinical suspicion for fracture, MRI without IV contrast can 
detect fractures of the distal radius and carpal bones [12,23-25] . One study of patients in which the radiographic 
findings did not explain the clinical symptoms reported that the MRI led to a change in diagnosis in 55% of 
patients and a change in patient management in 66%  [12]. However, another study of patients with acutely injured 
wrists reported that the MRI did not predict the need for treatment better than the combination of physical 
examination and radiography [ 23]. More importantly, there was no difference in outcomes  with MRI compared 
with radiography [24].

ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 5 Acute Hand and Wrist Trauma  Most fractures of the thumb are visible on a 2-view radiographic examination, although there is a slight increase 
in dia gnostic yield with the addition of an oblique projection [ 13], which can be obtained along with a PA 
examination of the whole hand.  
In patients with suspected finger tendon injuries, radiographs are used to detect fracture fragments, as large 
fragments may require open reduction and internal fixation.  Radiographs are usually sufficient for  the evaluation 
of osseous “mallet” injuries, which include bony avulsion at the insertion of the extensor mechanism of the finger 
to the distal interphalangeal joint [16]. In these injuries, involvement of more than one -third of the articular 
surface usually requires operative fixation.  Palmar displacement of the distal phalanx or an interfragmentary gap 
of >3 mm is also an indication for surgery [ 16]. With extensor tendon injuries, radiographs are commonly used to 
assess for bone involve ment and determine need for operative fixation [ 17]. 
CT Area of Interest  
In patients with intra -articular fractures seen on radiography , CT shows articular fracture fragment displacement, 
depression, and comminution more accurately than conventional radiographs [ 7,9,10]. CT measurements of 
articular surface gap and step -off are more reproducible than radiographs [7]. The addition of 3- D surface -

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Hand injuries account for approximately 20% of emergency department visits [ 1]. According to the National 
Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey , 1.5% of all emergency department visits involve  hand and wrist 
fractu res. Distal radius fractures are especially common, accounting for up to 18% of fractures in the elderly [ 2,3]. 
Because of increasing rates of osteoporosis, the incidence of distal radius fractures has been increasing [ 4]. 
Although most distal radius fractures in e lderly patients are managed non operatively, the use of internal fixation is 
increasing. Internal fixation has a much higher cost than nonopera tive treatment as well as increased rates of 
hospitalization [5]. 
For most patients with trauma to the hand and wrist, conventional radiographs provide sufficient diagnostic 
information to guide the treating physician.  However, delayed diagnosis is common because distal radius and 
scaphoid fractures may be radiographically occult  [6]. When initial radiographs  are normal but there is high 
clinical suspicion for fracture, further imaging with additional radiographic pr ojections, CT, or MRI  is 
appropriate .

of >3 mm is also an indication for surgery [ 16]. With extensor tendon injuries, radiographs are commonly used to 
assess for bone involve ment and determine need for operative fixation [ 17]. 
CT Area of Interest  
In patients with intra -articular fractures seen on radiography , CT shows articular fracture fragment displacement, 
depression, and comminution more accurately than conventional radiographs [ 7,9,10]. CT measurements of 
articular surface gap and step -off are more reproducible than radiographs [7]. The addition of 3- D surface -
rendered reconstructions to the standard 2 -D CT images has been shown to change operative management in up to 
48% of intra -articular distal radius fractures [8]. 
There is no evidence to support the use of CT with intravenous  (IV) contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist 
trauma.

ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 8 Acute Hand and Wrist Trauma  MRI Hand  
MRI is ideal for evaluating tendon injuries and helping with surgical planning [58, 59]. MRI is comm only used for 
the diagnosis of  Stener lesions of the thumb [60] and the diagnosis of pulley system injuries [61]. 
Hergan et al [62] reported a 100% sensitivity and specificity for assessment of thumb ulnar collateral ligament 
tears. Spaeth et al [ 63] reported a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 94% for detection of displaced ulnar 
collateral ligament tears in 16 cadaveric specimens.  
US Hand  
A Stener lesion occurs when the aponeurosis of the adductor pollicis muscle becomes interposed between the 
ruptured ulnar collateral ligament of the thumb and its site  of insertion at the base of the proximal phalanx. This 
lesion can be identified by absence of ulnar collateral ligament and the presence of a hypoechoic mass proximal to 
the apex of the metacarpal tubercle [64]. Dynamic examination shows the relationship of the aponeurosis to the 
retracted ligament stump [65] . 
US allows for diagnosis of pulley system injuries [ 66,67]. 
Bone Scan Hand 
Bone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  
Variant 6: Initial radiographs showing metaca rpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, or distal 
interphalangeal joint malalignment in the absence of fracture. Next imaging study.  
CT Hand  
CT has limited use for the diagnosis of soft -tissue injuries of the fingers.  
MRI Hand  
MRI is ideal for evaluating tendon injuries and helping with surgical planning [58]. MRI may be used to assess 
capsule and collateral ligament injuries of the proximal interphalangeal  and metacarpophalangeal joints [68]. 
For flexor tendon injuries, Rubin et al [ 69] reported a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of  100% in cadavers.

If associated soft -tissue injury is clinically suspected, CT, CT arthrography, MR I, MR arthrography, 
or ultrasound (US) may be indicated  [7-10]. 
Successful treatment of distal radius fractures requires restoration of radial length, inclination, and tilt, as well as 
the realignment of the articular fracture fragments [9,11]. The presence of a coronally  oriented fracture line, die -
punch depression, or more than three articular fracture fragments are common indications for operative reduction 
[8]. Operative fixation resulting in < 2 mm of residual articular surface step-off is usually considered necessary to 
avoid long-term complications , such as osteoarthritis [9 ,12]. 
Discussion of Procedures by Variant  
Variant 1: Acute blunt or penetrating trauma to the hand or wrist. Initial imaging.  
Radiograph y Area of Interest  
Radiography is  always indicated as the initial imaging for suspected acute hand and wrist trauma.  For m ost joints 
of the extremities, especially those involving the wrist, hand, and fingers, a radiographic examination that 
includes only 2 views is not adequate for detecting fractures [13]. For patients with suspected  distal radius 
fractures, a 3-view examination  of the wrist  usually includes a posteroanterior (PA) , a lateral, and a 45° 
semi pronated oblique view  [11]. One study [ 14] reports that a fourth projection—a semisupinated oblique —
increases diagnostic yield for distal radius fractures.  
A standard 3 -view radiographic examination of the hand shows most fractures and dislocations of the metacarpals 
and phalanges [ 13]. For phalangeal injuries, some centers include a PA examination of the entire hand, whereas 
others limit the examination to the injured finger.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Fractures of the proximal femur (commonly referred to as hip fractures)  are a frequent  source of morbidity and 
mortality in elderly osteoporotic patients [1]. Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type 
result in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men 
[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs 
will continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of 
life following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays 
in diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -
and long-term mortality [6-13]. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of hip fractures is critical. Hip fractures 
cannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded on the basis of physical exam ination  alone ; therefore , imaging plays a 
key role in early  and accurate diagnosis [14] .

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  hip pain is a common chief  complaint  for patients , reportedly affecting  30% to 40% of adults  who play 
sports  [1,2] , and 12% to 15% of all adults  over 60 [3,4] . A wide variety  of pathological  entities  may cause hip pain, 
including  osseous  as well as intra- or extra -articular  soft tissue abnormalities  [5-7]. Pathology  involving  the lumbar  
spine,  sacroiliac,  or knee  joints  can also cause hip pain [8], and these  etiologies  should  be investigated  as needed . 
There is limited  original  research  that specifically  targets the imaging  of chronic  hip pain,  but imaging  of specific  
conditions  is widely  discussed  in the published  literature. 
Before  imaging,  an appropriate  assessment  of a patient’s  clinical  history  and physical  examination  is essential  in 
trying  to pare down the range  of possible etiologies  for a patient’s  symptoms.

ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 6 Acute Hip Pain -Suspected Fracture  Bone Scan H ips 
Prior to the advent of MRI, a bone scan was the preferred test for radiographically occult proximal femoral 
fractures. However, as early as 1993 , Rizzo et al [50] demonstrated MRI to be at least as accurate as bone scan s 
and with substantially decreased time to diagnosis. A later study by  Rubin et al [51] comparing bone scan s and 
MRI demonstrated i mproved sensitivity and specificity of MRI relative to bone scans . Moreover, t he bone scan 
group averaged an additional day to surgery.  
Bone scintigraphy is a time-consuming process. Bone scans may be falsely negative for up to 72 hours from the 
time of in jury, and false-positive scans are likewise common, related to osteoarthritis, soft -tissue injury , or any 
other process that may increase bone turnover [50] . It has been postulated that performing single -photon emission 
computed tomography may combine the sensitivity of bone scintig raphy with the spatial accuracy of CT , but there 
are no data to support this view. In current practice, the role of bone scan s as a secondary line of imaging in 
patients with contraindications to MRI has largely been usurped by CT.  
Summary of Recommendations 
• Variant 1:  Radiographs  of the hip, radiographs  of the pelvis, or radiographs  of the pelvis and hips is usually 
appropriate for the initial imaging of the hip with acute pain, fall or minor trauma, and suspected fracture.  
• Variant 2:  MRI pelv is and affected hip without IV contrast  or CT pelvis and hips without IV contrast is 
usually appropriate as the next imaging study for the evaluation of a cute hip pain from a fall or minor trauma  
with negative radiographs  and suspected fracture.

A new inability to bear weight is a 
clinically suspicious finding , although the sensitivity and specificity of this is unknown  [20]. Allowing for 
variation between studies, the estimated prev alence of occult fracture after negative radiographs has  been 
estimated  at 4% to 10% , indicating the inability of negative radiographs alone to exclude fracture [21,26] . Risk 
factors for radiographically occult fracture in these studies included those age >65, low -force trauma,  such as a 
ground-level fall , and female gender. These studies have almost exclusively included elderly patients.  There is no 
relevant literature regarding the sensitivity and specificity of radiographs in the younger patient population,  and 
clinicians are suggested to proceed with caution.  
Radiography Pelvis  
There is no specific literature  regarding the use of an AP view of the pelvis  alone  for acute hip pain following 
low-force trauma.  Previous literature regarding the accuracy of radiography has almost exclusively evaluated AP 
and cross-table lateral radiographs of the hip or the combined use of AP pelvis and hip radiographs. However, i t is 
well established that patients with clinically  suspected proximal femur fracture often have fractures of the pelvis,  
including the sacrum and pubic rami [21,27-30] . Therefore , it has been  recommended that the radiographic series 
include the AP view of the pelvis along with the orthogonal  views  of the symptomatic hip [31] . The inclusion of a 
pelvis radiograph also allows for comparison of potential abnormalities to the contralateral asymptomatic side.  
Pelvis radiographs share the same limitations in sensitivity  and specificity  for fracture detection as hip 
radiographs , and a negative radiograph alone cannot exclude fracture . 
Radiography Pelvis and Hip 
As previously discussed, p atients with clinically suspected proximal femur fracture often have fractures of the 
pelvis  that includ e the sacrum and pubic rami [21,27- 30]. Moreover, these pelvic fractures may occur in isolation 
or concomitant with a fracture of the proximal femur [28].

Bone scintigraphy is a time-consuming process. Bone scans may be falsely negative for up to 72 hours from the 
time of in jury, and false-positive scans are likewise common, related to osteoarthritis, soft -tissue injury , or any 
other process that may increase bone turnover [50] . It has been postulated that performing single -photon emission 
computed tomography may combine the sensitivity of bone scintig raphy with the spatial accuracy of CT , but there 
are no data to support this view. In current practice, the role of bone scan s as a secondary line of imaging in 
patients with contraindications to MRI has largely been usurped by CT.  
Summary of Recommendations 
• Variant 1:  Radiographs  of the hip, radiographs  of the pelvis, or radiographs  of the pelvis and hips is usually 
appropriate for the initial imaging of the hip with acute pain, fall or minor trauma, and suspected fracture.  
• Variant 2:  MRI pelv is and affected hip without IV contrast  or CT pelvis and hips without IV contrast is 
usually appropriate as the next imaging study for the evaluation of a cute hip pain from a fall or minor trauma  
with negative radiographs  and suspected fracture.

Stress views are not routinely used for the evaluation of suspected tendon abnormality.  
Variant 5: Chronic ankle pain. Ankle radiographs normal or nonspecific, suspected ankle instability. Next study . 
In the absence of findings on routine radiography, imaging options to evaluate ligamentous integrity include stress radiography, MRI, MR arthrography, CT arthrography, and US.  
MRI  
One study eva luating anterior talofibular ligament injury demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy of 97% for MRI 
when compared to arthroscopic findings. Additionally, MRI identified the exact location of the injury in 93% of 
the cases [15].  Comparing MRI with arthroscopy, studies have shown a range of accuracies of chronic lateral 
ligament tearing (either partial or complete), ranging from 77 % to 92% for the anterior talofibular ligament and 
88% to 92% for the calcaneofibular ligament [14, 52]. For the evaluation of deep deltoid ligament tears, MRI is 
both sensitive and specific compared with arthroscopy, with reported values of 96% and 98%, respectively [53].  
With regard to tears of the tibiofibular ligaments of the tibiofibular syndesmosis, MRI has a reported accuracy of 100% [54]. Additionally, MRI can also demonstrate interosseous membrane tears [55]. MRI offers the advantage 
of evaluating for injuries associated with or mimicking lateral instability that may not be diagnosed on stress radiography such as tenosynovitis, tendon injury, and osteochondral lesions [56]. MRI may also be used to evaluate the ankle after lateral ligament reconstruction [57].  
MR Arthrography  
MR arthrography can be helpful for the assessment of chronic ankle instability due to lateral collateral ligament injuries [12].  
US 
One study evaluating anterior talofibular ligamen t injury demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy of 91% for US when 
compared to arthroscopic findings.

Variant  2: Adult  or child older  than  5 years of age. Acute trauma to the foot.  Ottawa  rules can be evaluated  
without  exclusionary  criteria.  Ottawa  rules are positive. Initial imaging.  
Radiograph y Foot  
Radiographs  are indicated  by positive  Ottawa rules with 99% sensitivity  in determining  the presence of a foot 
fracture  [1,9,10] . Radiographs  are the mainstay  of initial imaging in the setting  of acute foot trauma.  Initial  
imaging typically  consists of a 3-view study  with the possibility  of additional  views as indicated  by the clinical  
setting  [8]. Additional  views,  such as axial  calcaneal  view,  can be useful  in patients  with suspected  calcaneal  
fracture  [15] because addition of this view  increases specificity  in diagnosing calcaneal  fractures  and sensitivity  in 
distinguishing intra-articular  calcaneal  fractures.  
Lisfranc  Injury  
When  there is a fairly  high clinical  suspicion  of an acute Lisfranc injury,  the foot should be imaged.  In addition  to 
a typical  3-view  radiographic  study  of the foot (anteroposterior  [AP],  oblique,  and lateral),  an AP view with 20° 
craniocaudal  angulation can be added  [16,17] . Although patients  with Lisfra nc sprains may incur  ligamentous  
damage  without  diastasis [18], radiography  should be the initial imaging modality  in the setting  of a suspected  
Lisfranc injury.

ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 7 Acute Trauma to the Foot  injuries  in midtarsal  (Chopart) sprains,  which  frequently  accompany  acute ankle  injuries  [52,53] . If radiographs  
are negative,  MRI can be obtained in select  patients  with forefoot  pain because of its increased  sensitivity  for the 
early  detection  of metatarsal  head  subchondral  fracture  [54]. 
Lisfranc  Injury  
MRI has been  advocated  as a sensitive diagnostic  test in evaluation  of Lisfranc ligamentous  complex  (especially  
if the patient  is not able to bear weight),  and 3-D volumetric  acquisitions  have  proven superiority  over orthogonal  
proton  density  fat-suppressed  imaging [33,38,41- 45]. There is a high correlation  between  MRI and intraoperative  
findings  for an unstable  Lisfranc injury  [44]. In the patient  with a suspected  Lisfranc injury  and normal  
radiographs,  the literature  supports  further advanced  imaging  by MRI  and CT [21,33,43,46] . 
Turf Toe and Plantar  Plate Injuries 
MRI is the preferred  imaging method for evaluating  suspected  “turf  toe” and lesser  metatarsal  plantar  plate  injury  
by directly  evaluating  the soft-tissue structures of the capsuloligamentous  complex  as well as assessing  chondral  
and osteochondral  lesions [29,55,56] . 
Acute  Tendinous  Rupture  
MRI tends  to be used as a screening  tool when  one is not certain  of the specific tendon injury  or if concomitant  
osseous injury  is suspected.  Both  MRI and US have  been  shown  to be sensitive  for the diagnosis  of acute tendon  
rupture  or dislocation  in the foot [39].

Radiography Foot  with  Weightbearing  
If there are clinical  signs  of a Lisfranc  injury , obtaining  weight bearing  radiographs  is recommended  when  
possible  because nonweightbearing  radiographs  are not reliable  for detection  of subtle  injuries.  Weightbearing  
views have  been  shown  to increase the abnormal  alignment  at the Lisfranc joint, thus making it easier  to identify  a 
Lisfranc injury  [16,19] . The inclusion  of both feet on AP radiographs  can help in the detection  of subtle  
malalignment  when  compared  with the uninjured side [20]. 
CT Foot  
CT is commonly used in evaluating  the true extent  of osseous injury  in complex fractures and at times  is used as 
the initial imaging  study  in polytrauma  patients  and in complex  regions  such as the midfoot  [21,22] . CT is not 
routinely  used as the first imaging study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the foot with positive  Ottawa rules  
when  exclusionary  criteria  do not apply.

MRI  
is not routinely  used as the first imaging study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the foot in setting  of suspected  
MTP joint injury  or occult  fracture.  Both  MRI and US are used in evaluating  soft-tissue injuries  of the foot in the 
setting  of acute trauma,  especially  when  radiographs  are noncontributory.  Both  modalities  have  a similar  
sensitivity  for acute soft-tissue  trauma  about  the ankle  and foot such as ligamentous  and tendinous  disruption [36-
38].

rupture  or tendon dislocation  in the foot [36,39,40] . 
Fluoroscopy  Foot  
In addition  to routine  radiographs , fluoroscopy  has been  suggested  in assessment  of a hallux  MTP joint injury  
with direct  fluoroscopic  evaluation  of sesamoid  tracking  distally  with great  toe extension  at the MTP joint on

Patellofemoral car tilage loss is also associated with chronic knee pain , with active knee pain correlated with 
BMLs [30,31]. Similar to CT, MRI can calculate various anatomic measurements associated with patellofemoral 
subluxation/dislocation and lateral patellofemoral friction syndrome [32-34]. Bone marrow edema in the classic 
location for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also 
differentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise 
therapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. 
Other etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat 
pad impingement syndromes, Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome, adhesive 
capsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes , 
and osteonecrosis [15, 19,36-45].  
MRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a 
joint effusion. However, contrast -enhanced images ma y be more accurate in diagnosing other causes of chronic 
knee pain , such as Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome, and adhesive 
capsulitis [15].  In particular, enh ancing synovitis thicker than 2 mm in Hoffa’s fat is correlated with peripatellar 
pain [46]. Contrast -enhanced MRI is also useful in quantifying the degree of synovitis and in evaluating 
conditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis [ 17,42,47,48].

Bone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the 
subchondral bone.  New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or 
patients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee 
pain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the 
origin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. 
Subchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed 
spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to 
elderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs 
often initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, 
and progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is 
suspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria
® 
topic on “ Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae ” [28]. 
Some patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using 
quantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs 
exhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ].

MRI with and without IV contrast is indicated when performing semiquantitative assessment of knee 
osteoarthritis using various scoring systems to include cartilage, synovitis, ligaments, BMLs , and menisci [18].  In 
obese patients with osteoarthritis on contrast -enhanced images, increased perfusion in Hoffa’s fat is associated 
with more severe anterior knee pain [59 ].  
MR Arthrography  Knee  
MR arthrography is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with osteoarthritis or chondrocalcinosis.  
US Knee  
US is not often useful as a screening test or a comprehensive examination.  US can detect synovial pathology, 
effusions , and cortical erosive changes [11]. Power Doppler US  can demonstrate increased synovial blood flow 
that is associated with knee pain and can demonstrat e reduced blood flow , which correlates with reduced knee 
pain following joint injections [60]. US can also demonstrate meniscal extrusion , a finding th at suggests an 
underlying meniscal tear , and , on occasion , chondrocalcinosis and peripheral meniscal tears [11].  
Bone Scan Knee  
Radionuclide bone scan  is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with chronic knee pain given the low 
specificity and decreased anatomic resolution compared to CT or MRI [11].  However, i t may help distinguish 
between bone and soft -tissue origins for pain as well as localize pain to one or more joints [11].  
Image -Guided Aspiration Knee  
If an effusion is present, US - or fluoroscopically guided joint aspiration can be performed for synovial fluid 
analysis if there is concern for crystal disease or infection.  Corticosteroid injections can also be performed as they 
may result in a 1  to 2 week reduction in synovitis on MR I in two -thirds of patients. MRI also demonstrates a 
subsequent increase in the synovial volume in approximately 70% of patients that develop recurrent pain [61 ].

Summary of Literature Review  
Background/Introduction 
Chronic knee pain affects tens of millions of people  in the United States annually , with the pain sometimes highly 
disabling and often negatively impacting the patient’s quality of life. Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and 
it can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain 
with the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. 
Typically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain 
persists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  
imaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated 
that approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the 
prior year) radiographs [2 ]. 
This document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  ≥5 years of age.

Another  meta -analysis of 4 US studies including  246 patients  revealed  pooled sensitivity  of 90% and specificity  of 
97% in the diagnosis  of ACL  injuries  [47]. An US study  in correlation  with MRI  and pivot  shift testing  suggested  
a potential utility  of US examination  in diagnosis  of the anterolateral  ligament injury  [48]. Wang  et al [49] found  
2-D US a potentially  useful  tool in diagnosis  of posterior  cruciate ligament  injuries  with a posterior  cruciate ligament  
thickness ≥6.5 mm as a recommended  diagnostic  criterion.  
Variant  4: Skeletally  immature  child. Fall or acute twisting  trauma  to the knee.  No fracture  seen on 
radiographs.  Suspect  occult  fracture or internal derangement.  Next  study. 
CT Knee  
With  negative radiographs,  CT may be performed  as the next imaging study  for the evaluation  of suspected  
radiographically  occult  knee  fractures  [12] and bone  marrow  contusions  [16-18]. CT may diagnose  or predict  
ligamentous  injuries  [14,15,50,51]  and predict  menisc al [15,50,51]  injuries. However,  MRI is superior  to CT in 
evaluation  of bone  marrow  lesions [27-29], meniscal  [21,26]  and ligamentous  [21,31-34]  injuries , and may be 
subsequently  performed  as clinically  indicated.

painful or asymptomatic knee not significantly different in patients 45 to 55 years of age [20,21]. 
Bone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the 
subchondral bone.  New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or 
patients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee 
pain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the 
origin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. 
Subchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed 
spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to 
elderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs 
often initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, 
and progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is 
suspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria
® 
topic on “ Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae ” [28]. 
Some patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using 
quantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs 
exhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ].

Patellofemoral car tilage loss is also associated with chronic knee pain , with active knee pain correlated with 
BMLs [30,31]. Similar to CT, MRI can calculate various anatomic measurements associated with patellofemoral 
subluxation/dislocation and lateral patellofemoral friction syndrome [32-34]. Bone marrow edema in the classic 
location for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also 
differentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise 
therapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. 
Other etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat 
pad impingement syndromes, Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome, adhesive 
capsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes , 
and osteonecrosis [15, 19,36-45].  
MRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a 
joint effusion. However, contrast -enhanced images ma y be more accurate in diagnosing other causes of chronic 
knee pain , such as Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome, and adhesive 
capsulitis [15].  In particular, enh ancing synovitis thicker than 2 mm in Hoffa’s fat is correlated with peripatellar 
pain [46]. Contrast -enhanced MRI is also useful in quantifying the degree of synovitis and in evaluating 
conditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis [ 17,42,47,48].

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Ankle pain is considered chronic when symptoms persist > 6 weeks. Chronic ankle  pain can be caused by a variety 
of osseous or soft -tissue abnormalities, either alone or in combination. For assessing chronic ankle pain, there are 
multiple imaging options, including radiography, stress radiography,  computed tomography (CT)  radionuclide 
bone scanning, ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and various injection procedures. Injection 
proce dures include arthrography, CT arthrography, MR arthrography, and diagnostic injection with anesthetic 
agents. Although there are numerous causes for chronic ankle pain, common etiologies include osteoarthritis, 
osteochondral injury, tendon abnormalities, ligament abnormalities and instability, and impingement.  
Overview of Imaging Modalities  
Radiography Radiographs can provide information about the osseous and soft -tissue structures about the ankle. Routine 
radiographs of the ankle typically include anteroposterior, lateral, and mortise views, the latter obtained by internally rotating the foot 15 to 20 degrees.

effusions may also be identified in the anterior ankle joint recess by radiography with 53% to 74% accuracy  [19]. 
They are often associated with ligamentous injury or fracture [19]. The presence of ossific fragments can indicate 
ligamentous injury or retinaculum avulsion [20], whereas periostitis can occur adjacent to tenosynovitis.

In the absence of findings on routine radiography, imaging options to evaluate ligamentous integrity include stress radiography, MRI, MR arthrography, CT arthrography, and US.  
MRI  
One study eva luating anterior talofibular ligament injury demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy of 97% for MRI 
when compared to arthroscopic findings. Additionally, MRI identified the exact location of the injury in 93% of 
the cases [15].  Comparing MRI with arthroscopy, studies have shown a range of accuracies of chronic lateral 
ligament tearing (either partial or complete), ranging from 77 % to 92% for the anterior talofibular ligament and 
88% to 92% for the calcaneofibular ligament [14, 52]. For the evaluation of deep deltoid ligament tears, MRI is 
both sensitive and specific compared with arthroscopy, with reported values of 96% and 98%, respectively [53].  
With regard to tears of the tibiofibular ligaments of the tibiofibular syndesmosis, MRI has a reported accuracy of 100% [54]. Additionally, MRI can also demonstrate interosseous membrane tears [55]. MRI offers the advantage 
of evaluating for injuries associated with or mimicking lateral instability that may not be diagnosed on stress radiography such as tenosynovitis, tendon injury, and osteochondral lesions [56]. MRI may also be used to evaluate the ankle after lateral ligament reconstruction [57].  
MR Arthrography  
MR arthrography can be helpful for the assessment of chronic ankle instability due to lateral collateral ligament injuries [12].

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  elbow  pain is a common  patient  complaint  in the primary  care setting. Patients  may report  symptoms  of 
swelling,  pain,  restricted  range  of motion,  stiffness,  and numbness  or tingling  [1]. There is a wide  differential  
diagnosis  for chronic  elbow  pain, including osseous,  soft tissue,  cartil aginous , and nerve -related  abnormalities.  
Epicondylalgia , caused  by tendinosis  of the common  extensor  tendon laterally  (“tennis elbow”)  or medially  the 
common  flexor  tendon  (“golfer’s  elbow ”), is the most  common  cause of chronic  elbow  pain,  estimated  to occur in 
1% to 3% of the population  [2]. Epicondylalgia  is associated  with lost workdays  and a significant  economic  burden  
[3].

the trochlea [16]. 
MRI Elbow  
MRI elbow  may detect  loose  bodies,  and this is enhanced  in the presence of joint fluid.  Thus,  T2-weighted  images  
are recommended for the evaluation  of loose  bodies  in the elbow  [17]. MRI may also show  the presence of enlarged  
plica,  which  can result  in symptoms  of locking  and/or  pain with extension  [15]. MRI is often  suggested  as the initial  
study to assess for osteochondral  lesion  [12,17] . MRI  is less sensitive  than radiographs  in the detection  of 
heterotopic  ossification/calcification  [18]. Similar  to MR arthrography,  MRI elbow  is limited  in the evaluation  of 
cartilage defects [16]. 
US Elbow  
Although US may demonstrate  early -stage osteochondral  lesions and medial  epicondylar  fragmentation  [10], the 
details  of an osteochondral  lesion  are better  defined  by CT arthrography or MR arthrography.  Because of 
shadowing,  evaluation  of heterotopic  ossification  and loose  bodies  is limited  on US. 
Variant  3: Chronic  elbow  pain.  Suspect  occult  stress fracture or other bone  abnormality. Radiographs  
normal  or nonspecific . Next  imaging  study. 
3-Phase  Bone  Scan  Elbow  
Bone  scan is extremely  sensitiv e for detection  of stress fractures  and trauma  related  fractures [19-21] . 
Radiopharmaceutical  uptake  occurs in areas  of active bone  turnover , and thus, imaging  may be positive  in the 
presymptomatic  stage of stress injuries  [20].

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  elbow  pain is a common  patient  complaint  in the primary  care setting. Patients  may report  symptoms  of 
swelling,  pain,  restricted  range  of motion,  stiffness,  and numbness  or tingling  [1]. There is a wide  differential  
diagnosis  for chronic  elbow  pain, including osseous,  soft tissue,  cartil aginous , and nerve -related  abnormalities.  
Epicondylalgia , caused  by tendinosis  of the common  extensor  tendon laterally  (“tennis elbow”)  or medially  the 
common  flexor  tendon  (“golfer’s  elbow ”), is the most  common  cause of chronic  elbow  pain,  estimated  to occur in 
1% to 3% of the population  [2]. Epicondylalgia  is associated  with lost workdays  and a significant  economic  burden  
[3].

ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 7 Chronic  Elbow  Pain MRI Elbow  
MRI has high inter- and intraobserver  reliability  for the diagnosi s of epicondylalgia  [26]. It also has a sensitivity  of 
90% to 100%  and a specificity  of 83% to 100%  [27]. The most  specific findings  of medial  epicondylalgia  include  
interm ediate to high T2 signal  or high T2 signal  within  the common  flexor  tendon  and paratendinous  soft tissue  
edema [28]. MRI has the benefit  of demonstrating associated  findings  in epicondylalgia , including radial  collateral  
and lateral  UCL  injuries  [26]. MRI may also facilitate  surgical  planning [29]. 
MRI is useful  for the diagnosis  of biceps  tendon injury.  Sensitivity  and specificity  are reported  at 92.4%  and 100%,  
respectively,  in detecting  distal  biceps tendon  ruptures  and 59.1%  and 100%,  respectively  for partial  tears [30]. 
US Elbow  
US elbow  has moderate agreement  with MR elbow  for the diagnosis  and grading of common  extensor  tendon tears.  
US sensitivity, specificity,  and accuracy  are reported  at 64.25%,  85.19%,  and 72.73% , respectively  [31]. Recently,  
sonoelastography  has shown more  promising outcomes for detection  of medial  epicondylalgia  with a sensitivity,  
specificity,  accuracy,  positive  predictive  value , and negative  predictive  value  of 95.2%,  92%,  93.5%,  90.9%,  and 
95.8%,  respectively  [32]. Another  new technique,  superb  microvascular  imaging,  can be used to detect  subtle  low

MRI Elbow  
MRI elbow  may detect  loose  bodies,  and this is enhanced  in the presence of joint fluid.  Thus,  T2-weighted  images  
are recommended for the evaluation  of loose  bodies  in the elbow  [17]. MRI may also show  the presence of enlarged  
plica,  which  can result  in symptoms  of locking  and/or  pain with extension  [15]. MRI is often  suggested  as the initial  
study to assess for osteochondral  lesion  [12,17] . MRI  is less sensitive  than radiographs  in the detection  of 
heterotopic  ossification/calcification  [18]. Similar  to MR arthrography,  MRI elbow  is limited  in the evaluation  of 
cartilage defects [16]. 
US Elbow  
Although US may demonstrate  early -stage osteochondral  lesions and medial  epicondylar  fragmentation  [10], the 
details  of an osteochondral  lesion  are better  defined  by CT arthrography or MR arthrography.  Because of

complications of the fracture.  
Variant 12: Chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or nonspecific. Suspect carpal tunnel syndrome.  Next 
study. 
US Wrist 
Several meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the 
carpal  tunnel  inlet) is highly accurate for identifying carpal  tunnel syndrome  diagnosed clinically or with the 
combination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US 
varies depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the 
measurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary 
examination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel 
syndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal 
tunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, 
clinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of 
carpal tunnel syndrome. US may be appropriate in cases where this initial evaluation is equivocal.  
MRI Wrist  
Historically, carpal tunnel syndrome has been diagnosed based on clinical signs and sympt oms and confirmed by 
the results of electrodiagnostic studies [67]. MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in cases in which this  
initial evaluation is equivocal. The MRI findings that have been reported in wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome —
including nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing—may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value 
in patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68].

Score: 0.696655118983547","condition: chronic hand and wrist pain

In rare cases of secondary carpal tunnel syndrome, MRI may identify 
a mass lesion compressing the median nerve. There is some evidence that the length of T2 hyperintensity in the 
median nerve can help prognosticate the success of surgery [69] and that the shape and signal of the nerve predict 
clinical response to a steroid injection in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome [70 ]. MR neurography 
may be an option in patients with suspected carpal tunnel syndrome.  The use o f IV contrast does not contribute to 
diagnosis and is usually not appropriate.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
MR arthrography is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.  
CT Wrist  
CT, with or without IV  contrast, is not routinely used to diagnose carpa l tunnel syndrome.  
CT Arthrography  Wrist  
CT arthrography is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.  
Bone Scan  Wrist  
Bone scan is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.  
Arthrography  Wrist  
Radiographic arthrography  is not routinely us ed to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome . 
Summary of Recommendations  
• Wrist radiographs are indicated as the best initial imaging examination in patients with chronic wrist pain. 
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal and a patient has persistent symptoms wi th an unclear diagnosis, 
MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate.  
• In patients with suspected inflammatory arthritis, MRI either with or without IV contrast is usually 
appropriate if guidance for management or prognostication is needed.  
• Patients with  suspected wrist infection should undergo aspiration.  
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal in a patient with ulnar -sided pain, either MRI without IV contrast 
or an MR arthrogram of the wrist is usually appropriate.  
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal in a patient with radial -sided pain, MRI without IV contrast is 
usually appropriate.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic foot pain is a frequent clinical complaint with approximately 14% to 42% of adults in the United States 
reporting foot problems, often with significant impact on mobility, difficulty performing daily activities , and 
increased risk of falling, particularly in older individuals [1,2] . Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a 
significant improvement in health-related quality of life with effective treatment of foot pain [3] . Estimating the 
prevalence of chron ic foot pain is challenging, because there is no consensus regarding the definition of chronic 
pain in the literature. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines chronic pain as any pain persisting 
past the normal healing time, suggesting 3 months in case of chronic pain of benign causes.  
Women are more commonly affected , and forefoot conditions are more frequent. Persistent pain for more than 6  
years has been reported in 51% of women between 70 to 75 years of age [4]. Because of  the wide range of causes 
of chronic foot pain, assessment of these patients with imaging studies in addition to a dedicated clinical 
examination is often needed [1] .

Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  
usually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, 
osteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite 
versus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess 
with radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton’s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other 
causes of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg’s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals 
or soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . 
Though radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in 
patients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The 
combination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a 
specificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15]. 
US Foot  
Ultrasound (US) is usually not indicate d as the first imaging  study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain, but may 
be performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of pathologic conditions of the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, 
and other conditions such as tarsal tunnel syndrome, Morton’s  neuroma , plantar plate tears,  and intermetatarsal 
bursitis. 
Variant 2: Persistent posttraumatic foot pain. Radiographs negative or equivocal. Clinical concern includes 
complex regional pain syndrome type I. Next imaging study.  
3-Phase Bone Scan Foot  
A 3-phase bone scan may be useful in cases of suspected complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type I reflex 
sympathetic dystrophy , and several imaging findings have been described.

Score: 0.684448810984523","condition: chronic foot pain

Although there is no relevant literature  to support the routine clinical use of US in the 
diagnosis of CRPS type II, high-resolu tion US may have a role giving its increasing use in nerve assessment [23] . 
Variant 3: Chronic metatarsalgia including plantar great toe pain. Radiographs negative or equivocal. 
Clinical concern includes sesamoiditis, Morton’s  neuroma, intermetatarsal bursitis, chronic plantar plate 
injury, or Freiberg’s infraction. Next imaging study.  
Bone Scan Foot  
Planar b one scintigraphy has low anatomic resolution and has been shown to be a nonspecific technique to assess 
the hallucal sesamoids [24]. However, bone scintigraphy with single -photon emission computed tomography 
(SPECT)/CT increases contrast resolution and anatomic localization of foci with increased osteoblastic activity  
[25]. Bone scintigraphy may demonstrate increased uptake in pathologic conditions affecting the fir st metatarsal 
sesamoids not evident on radiographs. A less dramatic uptake is noted in stress fractures, which may be helpful to 
differentiate between them and acute fractures [26]. When an indeter minate linear lucency is visualized on 
radiographs, a negative bone scintigraphy suggest s sesamoid bipartition [12] . Other conditions that may present 
positive findings on Tc -99m -methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scint igraphy include sesamoiditis, 
inflammatory or deposition arthropathies, osteoarthritis , and osteonecrosis [39]. In Freiberg’s infraction, a 
photopenic center with a hyperactive collar may be identified on early stages on high -resolution Tc -99m -MDP bone 
scintigraphy [27]. 
CT Foot  
CT may be useful to confirm suspected sesamoid stress fractures on radiographs and to distinguish between a stress 
fracture and a bipartite sesamoid with more precision than conventional radiography [28] .

Variant 1: Chronic foot pain. Unknown etiology. Initial imaging.  
Bone Scan Foot  
There is no relevant literature  to support t he use of nuclear medicine studies as the first imaging  study  in the 
evaluation of chronic foot pain.  
CT Foot  
There is no relevant literature to support the use of CT as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot 
pain.  
MRI Foot  
There is no r elevant literature  to support the use of MRI as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot

Radiography Foot  
Conventional radiography can be useful to distinguish among different causes of chronic foot pain and is usually 
the first imag ing study in evaluating patients with chronic foot pain.  
The value of radiographs in the diagnosis of tarsal coalitions has been extensively demonstrated. Overall 
sensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs 
in the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral 
and oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar 
coalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs 
on the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have 
been found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable 
methods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  
Radiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review 
by Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for 
radiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.  
Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain.

preferred  method for evaluation  of RA [18]. 
US has been  used to evaluate for osseous abnormalities  in the setting  of chronic  inflammatory  arthritis. Compared  
with radiography,  US has been  shown  to demonstrate a 6.5-fold  increase in the number  of detected  erosions of the 
metacarpophalangeal  joints  [12], but it is less accurate when  compared  with CT [11]. The f alse-positive  rate for US 
in detection  of metacarpophalangeal  joint erosions  has been  reported  as high as 29% [29]. Regardless,  large  erosions  
identified  with US at the second  and third  metacarpophalangeal  joints, the distal  ulna,  and the fifth 
metatarsophalangeal  joint are highly specific for and predictive  of RA [30]. US may also show  imaging  findings  
associated  with enthesitis  [25], with findings  of enthesitis  on power  Doppler  imaging  having  an accuracy  of 85.6% 
in distinguishing  peripheral  spondyloarthritis  versus nonspondyloarthropathy [31]. Studies  have  also found US to 
be helpful  in differentiating  RA and psoriatic  arthritis  [32,33] ; for example,  enthesitis  is a finding often  seen in 
spondyloarthritis  but not seen in RA. Increased  distance between  the nail and distal  phalanx in patients  with psoriatic

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic foot pain is a frequent clinical complaint with approximately 14% to 42% of adults in the United States 
reporting foot problems, often with significant impact on mobility, difficulty performing daily activities , and 
increased risk of falling, particularly in older individuals [1,2] . Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a 
significant improvement in health-related quality of life with effective treatment of foot pain [3] . Estimating the 
prevalence of chron ic foot pain is challenging, because there is no consensus regarding the definition of chronic 
pain in the literature. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines chronic pain as any pain persisting 
past the normal healing time, suggesting 3 months in case of chronic pain of benign causes.  
Women are more commonly affected , and forefoot conditions are more frequent. Persistent pain for more than 6  
years has been reported in 51% of women between 70 to 75 years of age [4]. Because of  the wide range of causes 
of chronic foot pain, assessment of these patients with imaging studies in addition to a dedicated clinical 
examination is often needed [1] .

Score: 0.7267669154297994","condition: chronic foot pain

Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  
usually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, 
osteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite 
versus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess 
with radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton’s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other 
causes of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg’s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals 
or soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . 
Though radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in 
patients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The 
combination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a 
specificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15]. 
US Foot  
Ultrasound (US) is usually not indicate d as the first imaging  study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain, but may 
be performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of pathologic conditions of the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, 
and other conditions such as tarsal tunnel syndrome, Morton’s  neuroma , plantar plate tears,  and intermetatarsal 
bursitis. 
Variant 2: Persistent posttraumatic foot pain. Radiographs negative or equivocal. Clinical concern includes 
complex regional pain syndrome type I. Next imaging study.  
3-Phase Bone Scan Foot  
A 3-phase bone scan may be useful in cases of suspected complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type I reflex

ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 4 Chronic Foot Pain  Discussion of Procedures by Variant  
Variant 1: Chronic foot pain. Unknown etiology. Initial imaging.  
Bone Scan Foot  
There is no relevant literature  to support t he use of nuclear medicine studies as the first imaging  study  in the 
evaluation of chronic foot pain.

MRI Foot  
There is no r elevant literature  to support the use of MRI as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot 
pain.  
Radiography Foot  
Conventional radiography can be useful to distinguish among different causes of chronic foot pain and is usually 
the first imag ing study in evaluating patients with chronic foot pain.  
The value of radiographs in the diagnosis of tarsal coalitions has been extensively demonstrated. Overall 
sensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs 
in the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral 
and oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar 
coalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs 
on the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have 
been found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable 
methods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  
Radiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review 
by Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for 
radiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.  
Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain.

Although there is no relevant literature  to support the routine clinical use of US in the 
diagnosis of CRPS type II, high-resolu tion US may have a role giving its increasing use in nerve assessment [23] . 
Variant 3: Chronic metatarsalgia including plantar great toe pain. Radiographs negative or equivocal. 
Clinical concern includes sesamoiditis, Morton’s  neuroma, intermetatarsal bursitis, chronic plantar plate 
injury, or Freiberg’s infraction. Next imaging study.  
Bone Scan Foot  
Planar b one scintigraphy has low anatomic resolution and has been shown to be a nonspecific technique to assess 
the hallucal sesamoids [24]. However, bone scintigraphy with single -photon emission computed tomography 
(SPECT)/CT increases contrast resolution and anatomic localization of foci with increased osteoblastic activity  
[25]. Bone scintigraphy may demonstrate increased uptake in pathologic conditions affecting the fir st metatarsal 
sesamoids not evident on radiographs. A less dramatic uptake is noted in stress fractures, which may be helpful to 
differentiate between them and acute fractures [26]. When an indeter minate linear lucency is visualized on 
radiographs, a negative bone scintigraphy suggest s sesamoid bipartition [12] . Other conditions that may present 
positive findings on Tc -99m -methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scint igraphy include sesamoiditis, 
inflammatory or deposition arthropathies, osteoarthritis , and osteonecrosis [39]. In Freiberg’s infraction, a 
photopenic center with a hyperactive collar may be identified on early stages on high -resolution Tc -99m -MDP bone 
scintigraphy [27]. 
CT Foot  
CT may be useful to confirm suspected sesamoid stress fractures on radiographs and to distinguish between a stress 
fracture and a bipartite sesamoid with more precision than conventional radiography [28] .

Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  
usually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, 
osteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite 
versus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess 
with radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton’s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other 
causes of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg’s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals 
or soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . 
Though radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in 
patients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The 
combination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a 
specificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15].

MRI Foot  
MRI allows accurate characterization of the pl antar fascia and adjacent soft -tissues and bones, and several imaging 
findin gs have been described in patients with plantar fasciitis and partial or complete tears of the plantar fascia on 
MRI [52]. Given that, some of the find ings in patients with plantar fasciitis are nonspecific; these findings can also 
be seen in asymptomatic patients.  MRI should always be correlated with clinical symptoms to avoid overcalling 
plantar fasciitis. Although no significant differences have been found in plantar fascia thickness on US and MRI, 
MRI is currently considered the most sensitive imaging study  in the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis [53]. There is no 
relevant literature supporting the routine use of contrast in the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis or tears.  
US Foot  
US has shown good sensitivity (80%) and specificity (88%) in the dia gnosis of plantar fasciitis when compared to 
MRI [54]. A diagnostic accuracy of 69% for abnormal focal echogenicity within the plantar fascia, 60% for edema 
around the plantar fascia, 78% for perifascial edema, 69% for rupture of the plantar fascia,  and 56% for an associated 
calcaneal spur have been found for US, using MRI as the reference standard [55]. Kapoor et al [56]  showed higher 
sensitivity and specificity of US elastography when compared to US in the detection of plantar fasciitis (95% and 
100% versus 66% and 75%, respectively) , using  MRI as the reference standard. US has been shown to be useful in 
the diagnosis of complete and partial tears of the plantar fascia [57]. Some authors regard US to be superior to MRI 
in differentiating true fiber interruption and tearing of the plantar fascia from edema [58].

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic foot pain is a frequent clinical complaint with approximately 14% to 42% of adults in the United States 
reporting foot problems, often with significant impact on mobility, difficulty performing daily activities , and 
increased risk of falling, particularly in older individuals [1,2] . Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a 
significant improvement in health-related quality of life with effective treatment of foot pain [3] . Estimating the 
prevalence of chron ic foot pain is challenging, because there is no consensus regarding the definition of chronic 
pain in the literature. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines chronic pain as any pain persisting 
past the normal healing time, suggesting 3 months in case of chronic pain of benign causes.  
Women are more commonly affected , and forefoot conditions are more frequent. Persistent pain for more than 6  
years has been reported in 51% of women between 70 to 75 years of age [4]. Because of  the wide range of causes 
of chronic foot pain, assessment of these patients with imaging studies in addition to a dedicated clinical 
examination is often needed [1] .

with a 3.0 T system is even more accurate than MRI performed with a 1.5 T system for TFCC lesions [37], but 
there are no studies comparing the accuracy of the two field s trengths in the same patients. The sensitivity for 
tears of the ulnar attachment of the disc and the peripheral attachments (the ulnocarpal ligaments) are only fair 
with noncontrast -enhanced wrist MRI [ 12,36]. IV contrast seldom provides added benefit in patients with ulnar -
sided wrist pain but may increase sensitivity for TFCC lesions if MR arthrography is desired but direct joint 
injection is not feasible.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
In patients with chronic wrist pain, imaging studies are  an important adjunct to history, physical examination, 
laboratory testing, and electrophysiology studies. The choice of imaging modality depends on the patient’s 
presentation and the clinical questions being asked. There are scenarios in which no imaging beyond baseline 
radiographs is necessary, but in other situations advanced imaging has added value for diagnostic eva luation and 
treatment planning.  
Overview of Imaging Modalities  
Radiographs  
Imaging evaluation of the painful wrist should begin with radiog raphs [1,2]. This simple study may establish a 
specific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, 
impaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -
anterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or 
more oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling 
[3]. A v ariety of stress positions and maneuvers can be performed to elicit dynamic instability that is not visible 
on standard radiographs [ 4]. Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. 
Additionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ].

With or without prior injury. Best initial study.  
Radiographs  
While there is no recent literature that directly addresses the role of first-line examinations for chronic wrist pain, 
radiographs are usually  appropriate as an initial study. Radiographs are widely available , and for many bone, 
joint, and alignment abnormalities, radiographs alone are diagnostic. In other patients, nonspecific radiologic findings (including those in the soft  tissues) combined with the history and physical examination may be 
sufficient for clinical diagnosis, or may suggest preferred secondary imaging studies.

Variant 6: Radial -sided chroni c wrist pain.  Radiographs normal or nonspecific . Next study.   
MRI Wrist  
MRI is accurate for diagnosing scapholunate ligament tears [8,10,38,39], and noncontrast -enhanced MRI is 
usually appropriate in this scenario . IV contrast seldom provides added benefit in patients w ith radial -sided wrist 
pain but may increase sensitivity for ligament lesions if MR arthrography is desired but direct joint injection is not 
feasible.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
Direct MR arthrography (with contrast injection either into the radiocarpal joint or into all three  compartments of 
the wrist) may be appropriate in this scenario; the examination has higher sensitivity than noncontrast -enhanced 
MRI—even when performed at 3.0 T —for diagnosis of complete and incomplete scapholunate and lunotriquetral 
ligament tears [3 ,8,38]. For the scapholunate ligament, direct MR  arthrography also allows more accurate 
determination of which specific segments of the ligament are torn compared to conventional MRI [43], which has 
important biomechanical implications for wrist stability. Direct MR arthrography also has an advantage over 
noncontrast -enhanced MRI for diagnosing extrinsic ligament abnormalities [44].  
CT Arthrography  Wrist  
The accuracy of CT arthrography and MR arthrography are similar for lesions of the scapholunate ligament [8 ].

In the past , fluoroscopic observation was used to establish the diagnosis of dynamic wrist inst ability. However, in 
most practices,  fluoroscopy is used either for g uidance during wrist injections  or as an adjunct to arthrography.  
Percutaneous aspiration of the wrist —which is indicated in cases of suspected septic arthritis or to assess for intra-
articular crystals—can be carried out with either fluoroscopic or ultrasound (US) guidance  if needed . 
Scintigraphy  
Bone scintigraphy has been used for diagnosing occult wrist fractures and as a screening procedure in patients 
with wrist pain and negative radi ographs. However, while it is sensitive to bone abnormalities, scintigraphy 
suffers from a lack of specificity [6 ]. Furthermore, bone scans cannot detect soft -tissue abnormalities  such as  
lesions of the ligaments, tendons, and cartilage, all of which are often responsible for chronic wrist pain.  
Arthrography  
Conventional (x-ray) arthrography can be performed with contrast injection into the radiocarpal joint al one or into

ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 16 Chronic Wrist Pain  Arthrography  Wrist  
Once a scaphoid fracture is identified, Radiographic arthrography does not contribute to the evaluation for 
complications of the fracture.  
Variant 12: Chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or nonspecific. Suspect carpal tunnel syndrome.  Next 
study. 
US Wrist 
Several meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the 
carpal  tunnel  inlet) is highly accurate for identifying carpal  tunnel syndrome  diagnosed clinically or with the 
combination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US 
varies depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the 
measurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary 
examination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel 
syndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal 
tunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, 
clinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of 
carpal tunnel syndrome. US may be appropriate in cases where this initial evaluation is equivocal.  
MRI Wrist  
Historically, carpal tunnel syndrome has been diagnosed based on clinical signs and sympt oms and confirmed by 
the results of electrodiagnostic studies [67]. MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in cases in which this  
initial evaluation is equivocal. The MRI findings that have been reported in wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome —
including nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing—may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value 
in patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68].

In rare cases of secondary carpal tunnel syndrome, MRI may identify 
a mass lesion compressing the median nerve. There is some evidence that the length of T2 hyperintensity in the 
median nerve can help prognosticate the success of surgery [69] and that the shape and signal of the nerve predict 
clinical response to a steroid injection in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome [70 ]. MR neurography 
may be an option in patients with suspected carpal tunnel syndrome.  The use o f IV contrast does not contribute to 
diagnosis and is usually not appropriate.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
MR arthrography is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.  
CT Wrist  
CT, with or without IV  contrast, is not routinely used to diagnose carpa l tunnel syndrome.  
CT Arthrography  Wrist  
CT arthrography is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.  
Bone Scan  Wrist  
Bone scan is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.  
Arthrography  Wrist  
Radiographic arthrography  is not routinely us ed to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome . 
Summary of Recommendations  
• Wrist radiographs are indicated as the best initial imaging examination in patients with chronic wrist pain. 
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal and a patient has persistent symptoms wi th an unclear diagnosis, 
MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate.  
• In patients with suspected inflammatory arthritis, MRI either with or without IV contrast is usually 
appropriate if guidance for management or prognostication is needed.  
• Patients with  suspected wrist infection should undergo aspiration.  
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal in a patient with ulnar -sided pain, either MRI without IV contrast 
or an MR arthrogram of the wrist is usually appropriate.  
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal in a patient with radial -sided pain, MRI without IV contrast is 
usually appropriate.

both the flexor and extensor wrist compartments [46]. Occult ganglion cysts are also easily identified with MRI, 
but some authors recommend use of IV contrast to distinguish ganglia from synovitis [ 47]. For noncystic soft-
tissue masses, MRI may demonstrate findings that are diagnostic for certain benign conditions (eg, lipomas, 
hemangiomas, benign nerve sheath tumors), and can stage the extent of involvement for nonspecific masses ( see 
the ACR Appropriateness Criteria® topic on “ Soft-Tissue Masses ” [48]). 
US Wrist  
Wrist US or MRI (without or without  and with IV contrast) are alternative initial examinations that are usually 
appropriate in this setting. US  is useful for examining extra -articular soft tissue s, such as suspected ganglion cysts 
[17],  with an accuracy similar to that  of MRI.  
CT Wrist  
There is no support in the literature for CT in the initial diagnosis of a palpable mass or suspected ganglion cyst 
with normal or nonspecific radiologic findings. CT may have a role in cases in which calcification or ossification

These factors make CT the 
preferred examination for suspected distal radioulnar joint subluxation, where images of both wrists can be  
obtained in both supination and pronation [1 ,13]. A disadvantage of CT  is its lower sensitivity to soft -tissue 
abnormalities  compared with MRI.  
High-resolution (typically multidetector) CT of the wrist following contrast injection into one or more wrist 
compartments (CT arthrography) is a powerful tool for diagnosing intra -articular abnormalities [14,15]. The 
intraobserver agreement on CT arthrogram images is extremely high and better than that reported for MRI 
[14,16]. 
US 
US of the wrist is useful for examining extra -articular soft tissues, such as suspected ganglion cyst s [17], because 
its accuracy is similar to that of MRI. US can also be used to diagnose abnormalities of the flexor and extensor 
tendons and tendon sheaths. For de Quervain disease (stenosing tenosynovitis of the abductor pollicis lon gus and 
extensor pollicis brevis tendon compartment), preoperative identification of a septum or subcompartmentalization 
within the first dorsal compartment with US  may affect surgical management [18 ,19]. 
In patients with suspected or established rheumatoid arthritis (RA), US examination of the wrist and selected 
finger joints can identify erosions and active synovit is (with the use of power Doppler), findings that influence 
early diagnosis and treatment decisions [20]. Using US to measure the size of the median nerve is a  validated  
technique in patients with clinical symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome [21-24].  
In addition, w rist US is a useful technique to guide therapeutic intr a-articular and other soft -tissue injections [25].

spin-echo or 3-D grad ient-recalled pulse sequences [36]. There is some evidence suggesting that MRI performed 
with a 3.0 T system is even more accurate than MRI performed with a 1.5 T system for TFCC lesions [37], but 
there are no studies comparing the accuracy of the two field s trengths in the same patients. The sensitivity for 
tears of the ulnar attachment of the disc and the peripheral attachments (the ulnocarpal ligaments) are only fair 
with noncontrast -enhanced wrist MRI [ 12,36]. IV contrast seldom provides added benefit in patients with ulnar -
sided wrist pain but may increase sensitivity for TFCC lesions if MR arthrography is desired but direct joint 
injection is not feasible.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
In patients with chronic wrist pain, imaging studies are  an important adjunct to history, physical examination, 
laboratory testing, and electrophysiology studies. The choice of imaging modality depends on the patient’s 
presentation and the clinical questions being asked. There are scenarios in which no imaging beyond baseline 
radiographs is necessary, but in other situations advanced imaging has added value for diagnostic eva luation and 
treatment planning.  
Overview of Imaging Modalities  
Radiographs  
Imaging evaluation of the painful wrist should begin with radiog raphs [1,2]. This simple study may establish a 
specific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, 
impaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -
anterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or 
more oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling 
[3]. A v ariety of stress positions and maneuvers can be performed to elicit dynamic instability that is not visible 
on standard radiographs [ 4]. Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. 
Additionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ].

The diagnosis of a specific inflammatory arthritis is typically established based on clinical and laboratory 
analysis. Advanced imaging is usually performed to determine disease activity, guide management decisions, and 
prognosticate outcomes. In patients with early RA and other inflammatory arthritides , active synovitis may be 
better quantified following MRI with IV contrast administration, possibly  if performed dynamically, allowing 
confident early diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment guidance in these patients  [27,28]. Additionally, 
inflammatory tenosynovitis may be more conspicuous after IV  contrast administration [29]. As is the case for any 
tomographic study, MRI is much more sensitive than radiographs for identifying erosions in RA [30 ,31]. More

sports  [1,2] , and 12% to 15% of all adults  over 60 [3,4] . A wide variety  of pathological  entities  may cause hip pain, 
including  osseous  as well as intra- or extra -articular  soft tissue abnormalities  [5-7]. Pathology  involving  the lumbar  
spine,  sacroiliac,  or knee  joints  can also cause hip pain [8], and these  etiologies  should  be investigated  as needed . 
There is limited  original  research  that specifically  targets the imaging  of chronic  hip pain,  but imaging  of specific  
conditions  is widely  discussed  in the published  literature. 
Before  imaging,  an appropriate  assessment  of a patient’s  clinical  history  and physical  examination  is essential  in 
trying  to pare down the range  of possible etiologies  for a patient’s  symptoms.

ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 8 Chronic  Hip Pain reveal  pathology  of the spine,  sacroiliac joints, or even  the knee  joint, which  could be the source of a patient’s  
chronic  hip pain [35-37]. 
US Hip 
The literature  indicates that US is useful  for the evaluation  of extra -articular  soft tissues in the region of the hip 
[23]. US can also nicely  demo nstrate fluid  collections  around the hip, such as bursitis  and paralabral  cysts.  Tendon  
pathology,  such as tendinosis , tears,  or snapping iliopsoas tendons  can also be identified  with US [38-41]. US may 
also be useful  for the dynamic  evaluation  of the iliopsoas  tendon,  such as in snapping  hip syndrome.  
Variant  3: Chronic  hip pain. Suspect  impingement  or dysplasia . Radiographs  negative  or nondiagnostic.  
Next  imaging  study.  
Bone  Scan  Hip 
There is no relevant  literature  to support  to the use of bone  scan of the hip in the evaluation  of suspected  hip 
impingement.  
CT Arthrography  Hip 
Pathology  associated  with femoracetabular  impingement  (FAI) may be both intra- and extra-articular . CT is often  
used for preoperative assessment  of bony anatomy  in the setting  of FAI and hip dysplasia [42-44]. CT arthrography  
has been  shown  to be sensitive  for detection  of acetabular  labral  tears [17], which  may be associated  with FAI. CT 
arthrography has also been  shown  to be more  helpful  in identifying  chondral  lesions [16] when  compared  to MRI.

US Hip 
In general,  US is limited  in its use for evaluating  osseous structures.  However,  there is limited  literature  that 
demonstrates that US can be used to evaluate osseous features of FAI such as the alpha -angle  [73]. However,  US is 
not able to adequately  evaluate osseous abnormalities  deep  to the cortex.  One of the advantages  of US is its ability  
to dynamically  evaluate for extra-articular  soft tissue  impingement.  US is not as sensitive as MRI or CT

MRI can also be useful  in detecting  extra-articular  impingements  (ischiopelvic,  ischiotrochanteric,  subspinous,  and 
femoropelvic ) [45,46] .  
Although  there  is a paucity  of supportive  data,  some  surgeons  may use both MRI and CT in order  to define  the soft 
tissues (labrum  and articular  cartilage)  and the bone , respectively . Measurements can be performed  on radiography,

Fluoride  PET/CT Skull Base to Mid-Thigh 
There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of fluoride  PET/CT skull base to mid-thigh in the evaluation  of 
chronic  hip pain thought  to be due to a noninfectious  extra-articular  abnormality.  
Image -Guided Anesthetic +/- Corticosteroid  Injection  Hip Joint  or Surrounding  Structures  
Fluoroscopic -, CT-, or US-guided anesthetic and/or  corticosteroid  injections  can be a useful  tool for the diagnosis  
of chronic  hip pain.  In addition to intra-articular  injections,  selective trochanteric and iliopsoas  bursal/peritendinous  
injections  can be performed  for diagnostic  purposes  using anesthetic and/or  corticosteroid  injectate,  respectively.  
Symptomatic  relief  following  selective injection  of particular  structure(s)  can help to define  the etiology  of the

Summary  of Recommendations 
• Variant 1 : Radiography pelvis and Radiography hip are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of chronic 
hip pain. These procedures are complementary (ie, more than one procedure is ordered as a set or simultaneously 
in which each procedure provides unique clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 2 : In the setting of chronic hip pain with negative or nondiagnostic radiographs, MRI hip  without IV 
contrast or US hip  is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for suspected noninfectious extra -articular 
abnormality, such as tendonitis or bursitis.  These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure 
will be ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 3 : In the setting of chronic hip pain with negative or nondiagnostic radiographs, MR arthrography hip 
or MRI hip without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for suspected impingement or 
dysplasia. These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be ordered to provide the

which  may be associated  with FAI, but other  authors  have  shown  that CT arthrography is not very good for the 
detection  of labral  tears [18].

MRI is currently  the reference standard  for evaluation  of labral  pathology [85]. For evaluating  labral  tears,  MRI

Summary of Literature Review  
Background/Introduction 
Chronic knee pain affects tens of millions of people  in the United States annually , with the pain sometimes highly 
disabling and often negatively impacting the patient’s quality of life. Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and 
it can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain 
with the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. 
Typically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain 
persists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  
imaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated 
that approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the 
prior year) radiographs [2 ]. 
This document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  ≥5 years of age.

Score: 0.734554394204889","condition: chronic knee pain

The 
variants discussed include: (1) initial exam ination ; (2) initial radiograph is normal or demonstrates a joint 
effusion; (3) initial radiogr aph demonstrates osteochondritis dissecans (OCD), loose bodies or history of cartilage,  
or meniscal repair; (4) initial radiograph demonstrates osteoarthritis or chondrocalcinosis; and (5)  initial 
radiograph demonstrates signs of prior (chronic) knee injur y (ie, Segond fract ure, tibial spine avulsion, etc ).  
To evaluat e knee pain associated with other conditions, please refer to the following ACR Appropriateness 
Criteria® topic on:  “Osteonecrosi s of the Hip ” [3] for osteonecrosis,  “Acute Trauma to the Knee ” for acute knee 
injuries  [4], “Imaging After Total Knee Arthroplasty ” for patients with total knee arthroplasty  [5], “Soft-Tissue 
Masses ” for a patient with a suspected soft -tissue mass [6], “Primary Bone Tumors ” for a patient with a suspected 
or known bone tumor [ 7], and “ Chronic Extremity Joint Pain -Suspected Inflammatory Arthritis ” for patient with 
suspected arthritis  or synovitis [ 8]. 
Special Imaging  Considerations  
Knee radiographs  should include at least one frontal projection of one or both knees (anteroposterior, Rosenberg, 
or tunnel), a tangential patellar view , and a lateral view of the affected knee [2,9]. Standing radiographs more 
accurately reflect medial and lateral compartment cartilage loss than supine radiographs with the posteromedial and posterolateral joint compartments  more accurately assessed using a weight -bearing flexion posteroanterior 
radiograph [9,10].

painful or asymptomatic knee not significantly different in patients 45 to 55 years of age [20,21]. 
Bone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the 
subchondral bone.  New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or 
patients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee 
pain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the 
origin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. 
Subchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed 
spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to 
elderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs 
often initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, 
and progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is 
suspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria
® 
topic on “ Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae ” [28]. 
Some patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using 
quantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs 
exhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ].

Patellofemoral car tilage loss is also associated with chronic knee pain , with active knee pain correlated with 
BMLs [30,31]. Similar to CT, MRI can calculate various anatomic measurements associated with patellofemoral 
subluxation/dislocation and lateral patellofemoral friction syndrome [32-34]. Bone marrow edema in the classic 
location for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also 
differentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise 
therapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. 
Other etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat 
pad impingement syndromes, Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome, adhesive 
capsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes , 
and osteonecrosis [15, 19,36-45].  
MRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a 
joint effusion. However, contrast -enhanced images ma y be more accurate in diagnosing other causes of chronic 
knee pain , such as Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome, and adhesive 
capsulitis [15].  In particular, enh ancing synovitis thicker than 2 mm in Hoffa’s fat is correlated with peripatellar 
pain [46]. Contrast -enhanced MRI is also useful in quantifying the degree of synovitis and in evaluating 
conditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis [ 17,42,47,48].

Bone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the 
subchondral bone.  New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or 
patients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee 
pain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the 
origin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. 
Subchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed 
spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to 
elderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs 
often initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, 
and progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is 
suspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria
® 
topic on “ Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae ” [28]. 
Some patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using

Summary of Literature Review  
Background/Introduction 
Chronic knee pain affects tens of millions of people  in the United States annually , with the pain sometimes highly 
disabling and often negatively impacting the patient’s quality of life. Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and 
it can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain 
with the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. 
Typically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain 
persists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  
imaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated 
that approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the 
prior year) radiographs [2 ]. 
This document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  ≥5 years of age.

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  shoulder  pain lasting  >6 months  is a common  presenting  complaint , particularly  in patients  ≥40 years of 
age [1]. Along with a thorough history and physical  examination,  imaging  plays  a critical  role in determining the 
source of chronic  shoul der pain.  Common pain generators in the shoulder  include  the rotator  cuff tendons,  biceps 
tendon,  labrum,  glenohumeral  articular  cartilage,  acromioclavicular  joint, bones,  suprascapular  and axillary  nerves,  
and the joint capsule/synovium.  Imaging  can help to guide  appropriate  therapy , which  can range  from  conservative  
measures such as physical  therapy  and cortico steroid  injections  to more  invasive  procedures  such as arthroscopy or 
surgery . This document  focuses on the imaging approach  to patients  with suspected  chronic  mechanical  shoulder  
pain.

Bone  Scan  Shoulder  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of bone  scan shoulder  in the evaluation  of chronic  shoulder  pain 
when  rotator  cuff disorder  or subacromial  subdeltoid bursitis  is suspected . 
CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
CT arthrography  has shown  good diagnostic  performance for depicting  rotator  cuff tendon  tears with a reported  
respective sensitivity  and specificity  of 99% and 100%  for the supraspinatus  tendon,  97.4%  and 99.5%  for the 
infraspinatus  tendon,  and 64.7%  and 98.2%  for the subscapularis tendon  [15]. CT arthrography provides  a 
comparable alternative  to MR arthrography in the evaluation  of rotator  cuff tendon tears [16,17] . CT arthrography 
is able to detect  very subtle  articular  surface cuff defects,  but, because of lack of contrast  extension  from  the 
glenohumeral  joint space,  it is less effective at demonstrating bursal  surface or intrasubstance tears,  which  are 
typically  well seen with MRI or US [18]. 
CT Shoulder  With  IV Contrast

shoulder  pain when  rotator  cuff disorder  or subacromial  subdeltoid bursitis  is suspected.

ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 15 Chronic Shoulder Pain  Radiography Shoulder  Additional Views  
Glenohumeral  osteoarthritis  is typically  well visualized  on conventional  radiographic  views,  without  the need  for 
special  views.  A standard  axillary  view can demonstrate posterior  subluxation of the humeral  head  and abnormal  
glenoid morphology in patients with severe osteoarthritis  [145-147] . A measurement  of the critical shoulder  angle  
can be drawn  on routine  AP radiographs  by measuring  the angle  between  a line along the glenoid  surface and a line 
from  the inferior glenoid to the lateral  acromial  margin;  patients  with a higher  measurement  may be at high risk of 
having a full thickness rotator  cuff tear [148] . 
US Shoulder  
Although secondary  signs  of osteoarthritis  such as osteophytes,  joint effusion , and intra-articular  bodies  can be seen 
with US [142] , it is not typically  performed  for this indication.

US is reported  to be 98% sensitive and 94% specific for calcium  hydroxyapatite  in the rotator  cuff tendons  [71], 
although  identification  may be challenging if the area of calcium  deposition  is small . At times  US may have  
difficulty  distinguishing calcific  deposits  from  heterotopic  ossification  because both can result  in dense shadowing  
at US. US can be used if there  is concern  for concomitant  rotator  cuff tendon tear and may be a better  modality  than 
MRI in this situation  given the difficulty  of distinguishing  calcium  from  normal  tendon at MRI.  
Variant  4: Chronic  shoulder  pain. Suspect  labral pathology  or shoulder  instability.  Initial radiographs

There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of bone  scan shoulder  in the evaluation  of chronic  shoulder  pain 
when  labral  pathology  or shoulder  instability  is suspected.  
CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
CT arthrograms  have  been  shown  to be an accurate modality  in the assessment  of shoulder  instability  because of  its 
depiction  of osseous,  cartilaginous,  and labroligamentous  injuries  [18,72] . Labral  evaluation  in the postoperative  
setting  may be better  with CT arthrography than MRI  in patients  with metallic  suture  anchors  [73] and has been  
used to evaluate for healing  after superior  labrum  anterior -to-posterior  (SLAP)  repair  [74]. Dual -energy  CT 
arthrography  has a similar  diagnostic  performance  as MR arthrography  [75].

Although evaluation  of glenoid bony integrity  is typically  better  with CT imaging,  some  practitioners have  used 
ultrashort  or zero echo  time sequences [96-98], 3-D sequences  [99], or conventional  MRI  sequences  [100]  to 
measure glenoid bone  loss with a high concordance  to CT images.  
Radiography Shoulder  Additional Views  
There are several  options  for additional  radiographic  views in patients  with suspected  instability  [1]. The West  Point  
and Garth  views can demonstrate the anterior  inferior glenoid at a better  advantage  in patients  with a suspected  
Bankart  fracture.  A Stryker  notch  view can sometimes demonstrate  a Hill-Sachs lesion  that is difficult  to see on 
conventional  projections.  Although these additional  projections  are used by some  practitioners , they do not usually  
alleviate  the need  for advanced  imaging.  
US Shoulder  
The posterior  labrum  can be reliably  visualized  with US, with posterior  labral  tears potentially  visualized  
particularly  if the joint is distended  [101] . However,  US is of limited  benefit  in assessing  the anterior

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  shoulder  pain lasting  >6 months  is a common  presenting  complaint , particularly  in patients  ≥40 years of 
age [1]. Along with a thorough history and physical  examination,  imaging  plays  a critical  role in determining the 
source of chronic  shoul der pain.  Common pain generators in the shoulder  include  the rotator  cuff tendons,  biceps 
tendon,  labrum,  glenohumeral  articular  cartilage,  acromioclavicular  joint, bones,  suprascapular  and axillary  nerves,  
and the joint capsule/synovium.  Imaging  can help to guide  appropriate  therapy , which  can range  from  conservative  
measures such as physical  therapy  and cortico steroid  injections  to more  invasive  procedures  such as arthroscopy or 
surgery . This document  focuses on the imaging approach  to patients  with suspected  chronic  mechanical  shoulder  
pain.

Thickening of the coracohumeral  ligament, increased  rotator  interval  soft tissue,  and decrease d external  
rotation  on dynamic  US are all highly sensitive and specific findings  for adhesive capsulitis  [115]. Thickening of 
the axillary  recess capsule  can be accurately  measured  with US and is associated  with adhesive  capsulitis [116] . 
Hyperemia with Doppler  imaging,  particularly  with microflow  imaging,  can also be seen in the subcoracoid fat 
triangle  in patients  with adhesive capsulitis  [117] . One study found  that findings  of adhesive capsulitis  on US were  
correlated  with clinical  assessment , whereas findings  on MRI were not [108] . 
Variant  6: Chronic  shoulder  pain. Suspect  biceps  tendon abnormality. Initial radiographs  normal  or

Bone  Scan  Shoulder  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of bone  scan shoulder  in the evaluation  of chronic  shoulder  pain 
when  biceps tendon abnormality  is suspected.  
CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
Reports  on the accuracy  of CT arthrography for biceps tendinopathy are variable.  Teixeira  et al [118]  reported  a 
sensitivity  of 74% to 79% and a specificity  of 93% to 95% for tendinopathy  as well as 100%  sensitivity  and 93% 
specificity  for complete biceps ruptures . However,  Rol et al [119]  reported  a correlation  of only 45% to 65% with 
subsequent  arthroscopy  in a study  consisting  mostly  of patients  who underwent  CT arthrography.  CT arthrography  
diagnosis  of biceps tendinopathy is primarily  based  off the change in tendon  caliber.

US is reported  to be 98% sensitive and 94% specific for calcium  hydroxyapatite  in the rotator  cuff tendons  [71], 
although  identification  may be challenging if the area of calcium  deposition  is small . At times  US may have  
difficulty  distinguishing calcific  deposits  from  heterotopic  ossification  because both can result  in dense shadowing  
at US. US can be used if there  is concern  for concomitant  rotator  cuff tendon tear and may be a better  modality  than 
MRI in this situation  given the difficulty  of distinguishing  calcium  from  normal  tendon at MRI.

However,  
fluid  within  the rotator  interval  or along  the axillary  recess due to the arthrogram  injection  itself  can serve as a 
limitation  to detecting  findings  of adhesive capsulitis  on MRI arthrography.  
MRI Shoulder  Without  and With  IV Contrast  
Contrast -enhanced  MRI can increase the conspicuity of axillary  recess capsular  thickening [110]  and rotator  interval

with patient  symptoms  [112] . 
MRI Shoulder  Without  IV Contrast  
Zhao  et al [113]  showed  that coracohumeral  ligament thickening,  anterior  capsule thickening,  and obliteration  of 
the subcoracoid  fat are the most  characteristic findings  of adhesive capsulitis  on conventional  MRI.  Chi et al [114]  
found a sensitivity  of 77% and a specificity  of 53% for adhesive capsulitis  with only coracohumeral  ligament  
thickening  on noncontrast  MRI,  with a lower  sensitivity  (23%)  but a higher  specificity  (87%)  in patients  who had 
all 3 findings  of adhesive capsulitis , including  coracohumeral  ligament  thickening,  rotator  interval  infiltration, and

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Traumatic shoulder pain is shoulder pain believed to be directly attributed to a traumatic event, either acute or 
chronic. This pain may be the result of either fracture (the clavicle, scapula, or proximal humerus) or soft -tissue 
injury (most commonly of the rotator cuff, acromioclavicular ligaments, or labroligamentous complex). The 
incidence of traumatic shoulder injuries is difficult to determine because some injury types, such as low-grade 
acromioclavicular separations or acute rotator cuff tears, are likely under -reported because patients  do not seek 
immediate medical treatment. However, as with many traumatic injuries, traumatic shoulder pain tends to 
disproportionately involve young adults and male patients [ 1,2]. 
The etiology of traumatic shoulder pain can often be made based on clinical examination, radiographs, and 
mechanism of injury. Traumatic shoulder injuries can generally be separated into in juries requiring acute surgical 
management and injuries in which conservative management can be attempted prior to considering surgical 
treatment. Unstable or significantly displaced fractures and joint instability are injuries most likely requiring acute 
surgical treatment.

Bone  Scan  Shoulder  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of bone  scan shoulder  in the evaluation  of chronic  shoulder  pain 
when  rotator  cuff disorder  or subacromial  subdeltoid bursitis  is suspected . 
CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
CT arthrography  has shown  good diagnostic  performance for depicting  rotator  cuff tendon  tears with a reported  
respective sensitivity  and specificity  of 99% and 100%  for the supraspinatus  tendon,  97.4%  and 99.5%  for the 
infraspinatus  tendon,  and 64.7%  and 98.2%  for the subscapularis tendon  [15]. CT arthrography provides  a 
comparable alternative  to MR arthrography in the evaluation  of rotator  cuff tendon tears [16,17] . CT arthrography 
is able to detect  very subtle  articular  surface cuff defects,  but, because of lack of contrast  extension  from  the 
glenohumeral  joint space,  it is less effective at demonstrating bursal  surface or intrasubstance tears,  which  are 
typically  well seen with MRI or US [18]. 
CT Shoulder  With  IV Contrast

Despite  
these limitations, US still provides  an excellent  method  to assess repair  integrity, with a high sensitivity  (80.8%)  
and specificity  (100%)  for recurrent  rotator  cuff tear [158] . The ability  to perform  provocative  maneuvers can 
further demonstrate abnormalities  that other  forms  of imaging  would be incapable  identifying.  
Summary  of Recommendations 
• Variant 1 : Radiography is usually appropriate for the initial imaging of chronic shoulder pain.  
• Variant 2 : US or MR arthrography or MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study 
in the evaluation of chronic shoulder pain when  radiographs are normal or inconclusive and rotator cuff

alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage 
the patient’s care).  
• Variant 3 : Image -guided anesthetic +/ - corticosteroid injection  is usually appropriate as the next imaging study 
in the evaluation of chronic shoulder pain when radiographs demonstrate calcific tendinopathy or calcific bursitis. 
• Variant 4 : MR arthrography or MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study in the 
evaluation of chronic shoulder pain when radiographs are normal or inconclusive and labral pathology or shoulder instability is suspected.  These procedures a re equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be

from  the inferior glenoid to the lateral  acromial  margin;  patients  with a higher  measurement  may be at high risk of 
having a full thickness rotator  cuff tear [148] .

ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 12 Shoulder Pain –Traumatic  MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography is the preferred exam ination  for the evaluation of subacute shoulder dislocations or recurrent 
shoulder instability. MRI has been shown to have similar performance to CT in the evaluation of Hill-Sachs 
lesions and glenoid bone loss [12,18]. MR arthrography has also been found to be reliable in diagnosi ng anterior 
shoulder instability and labroligamentous injuries [58,59]. MR arthrography has specifically o utperformed 
noncontrast MRI in assessment of glenohumeral ligament and anterior labral injuries [ 17,19], which ar e 
commonly seen in shoulder instability. MR arthrogr aphy has also outperformed noncontrast MRI in diagnosis of 
rotator cuff tears [17,19], which is a common associated finding in older patients with shoulder dislocation. 
However, high sensitivities reported for MR arthrography in the detection of labral pathology may not be 
applicable to patients with clinically unstable shoulders. A retrospective review of 90 patients with clinically 
unstable shoulders selected for arthroscopy [ 60] found that MR arthrography had a sensitivity of 65% for 
detection of labral  tears. The authors proposed that this discrepancy with prior studies was the result of different 
patient selection criteria (clinically unstable in their study versus less-specific symptoms such as shoulder pain in 
others) and the interpretation of MR art hrography by experienced musculoskeletal radiologists [ 60]. For this 
document, it is assumed the procedure is performed and interpreted by an expert.  
MRI Shoulder  
MRI without contrast may be pre ferred to MR arthrography in the setting of acute shoulder dislocation when a 
post-traumatic joint effusion is present to provide sufficient visualization of soft -tissue structures. In the subacute 
or chronic setting, the glenohumeral joint effusion is usually too small to provide adequate joint distention for 
optimal assessment  of soft -tissue structures.

CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
CT arthrography has similar performance as MR arthrography  for detection of full -thickness rotator cuff tears, but

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
There has been  a rapid  increase  in the number  of shoulder  arthroplasties,  including  partial  or complete humeral  head  
resurfacing,  hemiarthroplasty,  total shoulder  arthroplasty,  and reverse total shoulder  arthroplasty,  performed  in the 
United  States  over the past 2 decades [1]. The most  recent  published estimates have  reported  a 2.5-fold  increase in 
the number  of shoulder  arthroplasties performed  between  1998 and 2008,  from  19,000 to 47,000 [1,2] . Overall,  
total shoulder  arthroplasties are the most  common  type,  having surpassed  hemiarthroplasties in the last decade [1]. 
Most  shoulder  arthroplasties are performed  for degenerative  conditions.  Humeral  head  resurfacing  is indicated  in 
patients  with humeral  head  osteonecrosis,  large Hill-Sachs deformity,  or focal  osteoarthrosis.

Initial imaging.  
A symptomatic primary shoulder arthroplasty has a wide variety of potential etiologies that includ es loosening, 
infection, periprosthetic fracture, and rotator cuff tear. Periprosthetic  fractures of the glenoid  and humerus  can occur  
intraoperatively  as well as postoperatively.  Complications  related  to surgical  technique,  such as excessive  reaming  
or impaction,  are the most  common  reasons for fractures in the intraoperative  setting,  with a reported  incidence of 
2.1%  [6]. In the postoperative setting, a 1% incidence  of periprosthetic  fractures  has been  reported;  patients’  other  
medical  comorbidities  (assessed  using the Deyo -Charlson  index)  are found to be significant  risk factors [10,19] . 
Humeral  fractures  have  been  found to be more  common than glenoid fractures.  Fractures of the acromion  and spine  
of the scapula are more  common  in the setting  of reverse total shoulder  arthroplasty  and are thought  to be related  to 
an intraoperative  complication  or, more  commonly,  chronic  stress [4]. 
3-Phase  Bone  Scan  with  SPECT  or SPECT/CT Shoulder  
There is no relevant literature to support the use of a 3 -phase bone scan with SPECT or SPECT/CT as a first-line 
imaging modality in the acutely symptomatic patient with a primary shoulder arthroplasty.  Similar  to bone  scans,  a 
3-phase bone  scan is highly sensitive for the detection  of periprosthetic  fractures  but suffers  from  low specificity.

Proposed causes for this higher  prevalence include  longer  procedural  time and steeper  learning  curve  to perform  
the surgery,  large  dead  space,  multiple  previous  operations,  and advanced  patient  age [29].

glenoid morphology in patients with severe osteoarthritis  [145-147] . A measurement  of the critical shoulder  angle  
can be drawn  on routine  AP radiographs  by measuring  the angle  between  a line along the glenoid  surface and a line 
from  the inferior glenoid to the lateral  acromial  margin;  patients  with a higher  measurement  may be at high risk of 
having a full thickness rotator  cuff tear [148] .

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  shoulder  pain lasting  >6 months  is a common  presenting  complaint , particularly  in patients  ≥40 years of 
age [1]. Along with a thorough history and physical  examination,  imaging  plays  a critical  role in determining the 
source of chronic  shoul der pain.  Common pain generators in the shoulder  include  the rotator  cuff tendons,  biceps 
tendon,  labrum,  glenohumeral  articular  cartilage,  acromioclavicular  joint, bones,  suprascapular  and axillary  nerves,  
and the joint capsule/synovium.  Imaging  can help to guide  appropriate  therapy , which  can range  from  conservative  
measures such as physical  therapy  and cortico steroid  injections  to more  invasive  procedures  such as arthroscopy or 
surgery . This document  focuses on the imaging approach  to patients  with suspected  chronic  mechanical  shoulder  
pain.

Radiography Shoulder  
Radiography  is the first and main  imaging  modality  utilized  in the evaluation  of both the symptomatic  and 
asymptomatic shoulder  arthroplasty  [10,13] . Findings on radiographs can be used to diagnose and guide further 
assessment of both osseous and high-grade rotator cuff abnormalities. Radiographs  are particularly  helpful  for the 
detection  of scapular  fractures  that can occur  with relatively  minor  trauma  in patients  with reverse shoulder  
prostheses [24]. 
US Shoulder  
US examinations  are not typically  ordered  as a first -line study for  evaluation  of pain in the setting  of shoulder  
arthroplasty.  Nevertheless,  US provides assessment of the rotator cuff integrity and is  capable of detecting  cortical  
discontinuity and step-off in the setting  of a fracture  after shoulder  arthroplasty  [25]. 
Variant  3: Symptomatic  patient  with  a primary  shoulder  arthroplasty,  infection not excluded. Additional 
imaging following radiographs.  
Infection,  including osteomyelitis  and septic arthritis, after total shoulder  arthroplasty  is an uncommon albeit  
potentially  devastating  complication, with a prevalence of 0.7%  to 2.9% . Infection  is more  common  in males and a 
younger  age group  [3,26,27] . A 97% infection -free  rate at 20 years has been  reported  [28]. Predisposing  underlying 
conditions  may include  rheumatoid  arthritis, corticosteroid  use, diabetes,  repeated  intra-articular  steroid  injections,  
and prior  shoulder  surgery  [26]. 
Infection  rates are higher  in the setting  of reverse total shoulder  arthroplasties,  with a range  of 0.8%  to 10% [29].

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  hip pain is a common chief  complaint  for patients , reportedly affecting  30% to 40% of adults  who play 
sports  [1,2] , and 12% to 15% of all adults  over 60 [3,4] . A wide variety  of pathological  entities  may cause hip pain, 
including  osseous  as well as intra- or extra -articular  soft tissue abnormalities  [5-7]. Pathology  involving  the lumbar  
spine,  sacroiliac,  or knee  joints  can also cause hip pain [8], and these  etiologies  should  be investigated  as needed . 
There is limited  original  research  that specifically  targets the imaging  of chronic  hip pain,  but imaging  of specific  
conditions  is widely  discussed  in the published  literature. 
Before  imaging,  an appropriate  assessment  of a patient’s  clinical  history  and physical  examination  is essential  in 
trying  to pare down the range  of possible etiologies  for a patient’s  symptoms.

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
It has been  approximately  60 years since Sir John Charnl ey introduced the modern era of hip replacement  surgery  
[1]. Approximately  370,000 primary  total hip arthroplasties (THAs)  were performed  in the United  States in 2014  
[2]. Sloan  et al [2] estimated  that the volume of primary  THAs  would  increase to 635,000 procedure s annually by 
2030.  
Over  the years,  modifications  have  been  made  to attempt  to decrease  complications  such as loosening and wear  
with additional  fixation  techniques  (eg, osseointegration ) and articular  surfaces  (eg, metal  on highly  cross -linked  
polyethylene , antioxidant  doped polyethylene  liners,  metal -on-metal  [MoM], ceramic on polyethylene , and ceramic  
on ceramic articulations)  [3-5]. 
Second -generation  MoM prostheses were introduced in the late 1990s  [6]. These  prostheses were preferentially  
used for younger  patients  with osteoarthritis  [7].

Evaluation  
of 19 patients  suspected  of having  infection  showed  noncontras t MRI to be highly  reproducible  in the detection,  
localization, quantification, and characterization  of fluid  collections  [113] . 
Galley et al [110]  used optimized  MRI  sequences and found irregular  soft tissue mass,  soft tissue edema,  bone  
destruction,  and fistulas  to be significant  features  of periprosthetic  infection, with sensitivities  of 47.4%  to 100% 
and specificities of 73.1%  to 100.0%.  Albano et al [109]  found  lymph  node  assessment  (of the affected  compared  
to the unaffected  hip) identified  infected  implants  with high accuracies (up to 93.1%).  Galley  et al [110]  found 
periosteal  reaction, capsular  edema,  and intramuscular  edema after THA at 1.5T MRI with MAR  to have  high 
accuracy  in the evaluation  of periprosthetic  joint infection  (86%-91%  accuracy).  Schwaiger  et al [112]  were able to 
distinguis h patients  with infection  from  those  with loosening  using MRI features.  Soft tissue edema (sensitivity,  
86.7%  and specificity , >73.3% ), abnormalities  at both acetabular  and femoral  components  (sensitivity/specificity,  
66.7% /93.3% -100% ), and enlarged  lymph nodes  (80% /86.7% ) enabled  this differentiation .

Summary  of Recommendations 
• Variant 1 : Radiography pelvis and Radiography hip are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of chronic 
hip pain. These procedures are complementary (ie, more than one procedure is ordered as a set or simultaneously 
in which each procedure provides unique clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 2 : In the setting of chronic hip pain with negative or nondiagnostic radiographs, MRI hip  without IV 
contrast or US hip  is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for suspected noninfectious extra -articular 
abnormality, such as tendonitis or bursitis.  These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure 
will be ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 3 : In the setting of chronic hip pain with negative or nondiagnostic radiographs, MR arthrography hip 
or MRI hip without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for suspected impingement or 
dysplasia. These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be ordered to provide the 
clinical informatio n to effectively manage the patient’s care).

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Fractures of the proximal femur (commonly referred to as hip fractures)  are a frequent  source of morbidity and 
mortality in elderly osteoporotic patients [1]. Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type 
result in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men 
[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs 
will continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of 
life following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays 
in diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -
and long-term mortality [6-13]. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of hip fractures is critical. Hip fractures 
cannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded on the basis of physical exam ination  alone ; therefore , imaging plays a 
key role in early  and accurate diagnosis [14] .

In a review,  Fritz  et al [18] noted  that radiographs  are usual ly the first imaging  modality  for patients  with

greater  trochanter,  and heterotopic  ossification  [18]. Radiographs  show ing >2 mm surface  irregularities  of the 
greater  trochanter  have  been  reported  with abductor  tendon abnormalities  and peritendinous  edema on MRI [62]. 
However,  a review of 38 cases of greater  trochanter  pain syndrome  and 100 controls  showed  the findings  of 
trochanteric surface irregularities  including spurs  protruding 2 mm were associated  with a 24.7%  PPV, 64.0%

value  (NPV) for clinical  greater  trochanteric pain syndrome  [63]. 
MoM hip prosthese s: The FDA notes  that in the symptomatic  patient following  insertion  of a MoM prosthesis,  
radiographs  in conjunction with nonimaging information,  may disclose the need  for revision  [44]. Metallosis

Bone  Scan  and Gallium  Scan  Hip 
The most  recent  data on bone  and gallium  scans for diagnosing periprosthetic  hip infection  are more  than 25 years  
old because this test has been  largely  replaced  by labeled  leukocyte  and marrow  imaging  and FDG -PET [77-79]. 
Bone  Scan and Gallium  Scan  with SPECT  or SPECT/CT Hip 
There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of bone  and gallium  scan with SPECT or SPECT/CT of the hip as 
these tests have  been  replaced  by leukocyte  and bone  marrow  imaging  and FDG-PET for diagnosing  periprosthetic  
hip infection.  
Bone  Scan  Hip 
Bone  scan of the hip is sensitive but not specific for periprosthetic  hip infection.  Performing  the test as a 3-phase  
bone  scan does not improve  accuracy,  with reported  sensitivity  and specificity  ranging  from  29% to 88% and 50% 
to 92%,  respectively  [61,80 -82]. 
Bone  Scan  with  SPECT  or SPECT/CT  Hip 
Schweizer  et al [83] retrospectively  studied  58 total hip prostheses,  including  31 symptomati c and 27 asymptomatic  
prostheses,  with bone  scan with SPECT/CT. SPECT/CT identified  the cause of pain in 19 (61%)  of the 31 
symptomatic  devices.  No pathology-specific uptake  pattern  was observed.

to the unaffected  hip) identified  infected  implants  with high accuracies (up to 93.1%).  Galley  et al [110]  found 
periosteal  reaction, capsular  edema,  and intramuscular  edema after THA at 1.5T MRI with MAR  to have  high 
accuracy  in the evaluation  of periprosthetic  joint infection  (86%-91%  accuracy).  Schwaiger  et al [112]  were able to

reported that an abnormal scan could not differentiate aseptic loosening from infection. Although a normal result 
excluded aseptic loosening and infection, the ability of the bone scan to identify or exclude other conditions such as wear, osteolysis, and soft tissue abnormalities as the cause of the patient’s symptoms was not addressed.

greater  trochanter  have  been  reported  with abductor  tendon abnormalities  and peritendinous  edema on MRI [62]. 
However,  a review of 38 cases of greater  trochanter  pain syndrome  and 100 controls  showed  the findings  of 
trochanteric surface irregularities  including spurs  protruding 2 mm were associated  with a 24.7%  PPV, 64.0%

Joint  distension  and decompression  of synovitis  into the greater  trochanteric bursa  and fluid  undermining the hip 
abductors  can be assessed  on MARS -MRI  [72]. Weber  et al [141]  noted that extracapsular  disease associated  with 
ARMD could be misinterpreted  as trochanteric  bursitis. 
Radiographic  Arthrography  Hip 
Weakness or detachment  of the abductor  muscles may occur  after THA using  an anterolateral  approach  [148] . 
Avulsion of the reattached  gluteus  medius  can provide  a communication between  the hip joint and the trochanteric 
bursa  that can be documented on arthrography [148] . Ylinen  et al [148]  found that all 14 patients  with this 
communication had abductor  avulsion  at revision  surgery.  A negative  study  did not exclude disruption  (sensitivity  
60.1%,  specificity  100%).  The failure  of contrast  to extend to the trochanteric region in these cases was attributed  
to blocking of its flow by a fibrous  capsule.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Fractures of the proximal femur (commonly referred to as hip fractures)  are a frequent  source of morbidity and 
mortality in elderly osteoporotic patients [1]. Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type 
result in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men 
[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs 
will continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of 
life following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays 
in diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -
and long-term mortality [6-13]. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of hip fractures is critical. Hip fractures 
cannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded on the basis of physical exam ination  alone ; therefore , imaging plays a 
key role in early  and accurate diagnosis [14] .

Severe instability  can result  in 
dislocation. In a 2014 review of 781 cases of prosthesis failure,  Sharkey  et al [12] found that instability  represented  
the third  most  common  cause of prosthesis failure  overall,  accounting  for 7.5%  of all cases.  The concepts of 
instability, malalignment, and loosening in TKA are closely  interrelated  [117] . When  malalignme nt of the joint is 
created  at the time of surgery,  minor  degrees of instability  can become a significant  problem.  By the same  token,  
instability, ongoing over time, can give rise to malalignment, which,  in turn, can lead to loosening.  Although 
ligamentous  balance/imbalance plays  a role in joint instability, it is not the only factor  accounting for stability  [118] . 
3-Phase  Bone  Scan  Knee  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  routine  use of Tc-99m  3-phase bone  scans for the assessment  of instability.  
Bone  scintigraphy may be helpful  in diagnosing loosening,  especially  when  obtained many  years after surgery  [62]. 
This delay  in maximum utility  is because of  the observation that positive  bone  scans are noted in 20% of 
asymptomatic knees 1 year after surge ry and in 12.5%  of individuals  2 years after surgery [61] . Serial  bone  scans 
may be more  helpful  than a single  examination  [119] . Generally,  increased  uptake  on the delayed  images  but not 
on the blood- pool phase is thought  to be due to loosening rather  than to infection  [60]. Normal  scans are most  
helpful  and are characterized  by a high NPV,  indicating  that loosening or infection  is unlikely.  A potential false  
negative ; however,  may occur  if there is loosening at the cement –prosthetic  interface that does not incite  new bone  
formation  [66].

Periprosthetic  fractures may occur  either  during or after surgery  and can involve  the femur,  tibia, or patella.  Among  
periprosthetic  fractures,  supracondylar  distal  femur  fractures are most  common,  whereas patellar  fractures are rare

often  occur  in the setting  of low-energy  trauma  [136] . Tibial fractures  are associated  with loose  components  and 
malalignment.  Patellar  fractures are associated  with rheumatoid  arthritis, steroid  use, osteonecrosis,  and 
malalignment.  Most  patients  with periprosthetic  fractures are elderly,  having poor bone  stock.  Treatment  depends

Around  10% to 30% of the 
patients  report  ongoing pain or are not satisfied  with the result  [9]. Factors,  which  contribute  to patient

rates of TKA revision  procedures  [1]. Revision  procedures  for TKAs have  increased  by 5.4 procedures  per 100,000  
persons  per decade over the period from  1990  to 2002,  with a mean  revision  burden of 8.2%  [11]. Nearly  1.5 million  
of those  with primary  knee  replacement  are 50 to 69 years  of age, underscoring a large population at risk for revision  
surgery  and long-term  complications  [5]. Sharkey  et al [12] reviewed  781 revision  TKAs and found  the most  
common  failure  mechanisms  were  loosening (39.9%),  infection  (27.4%),  instability  (7.5%),  periprosthetic  fracture  
(4.7%),  and arthrofibrosis  (4.5%) . Infection  was the most  common  reason  for early  revision  (<2 years after the 
initial TKA) , and aseptic loosening was the most  common  reason  for late revision.  Compared  with a review  
performed  by the same  author  in 2002 [13], polyethylene  wear  is no longer  the major  cause  of failure , and the 
percentages of revisions  for polyethylene  wear,  instability, arthrofibrosis,  malalignment,  and extensor  mechanism

Staphylococcus  aureus  and coagulase-negative  Staphylococcus  species,  including  Staphylococcus  epidermidis,  are 
the most  common organisms  associated  with these infections  [46]. Both  clinical  findings  and laboratory tests may 
serve useful  in addition  to imaging  studies.  Low-grade  or chronic  TKA  infections  may be difficult to diagnose  
preoperatively.  Duff  et al [18] noted that diagnosis  of infection  was not obvious  in 53% of knees before  revision  
arthroplasty.  Pain is the most  common  presenting  symptom  of infection, but pain is a nonspecific finding [47]. In 
acute infection,  findings  such as pain,  swelling,  warmth,  erythema,  and fever  are common,  whereas chronic  
infections  may be manifested  by pain alone  [44]. Night  pain or pain at rest is characteristic of infection, whereas  
pain on weightbearing  is more  characteristic of mechanical  loosening.  Some  authors  suggest  that infection  needs to 
be excluded  in all patients  with pain persisting  >6 months  after joint replacement  [18]. 
Laboratory findings  in the setting  of TKA infection  are often  nonspecific.  Peripheral  leukocyte  counts  are not 
elevated  in most  patients  with infected  prostheses.  Erythrocyte  sedimentation  rates (ESRs) are abnormal  in patients  
with infection, but this finding  may also be seen in uninfected  patients,  limiting  the usefulness of the test [48]. A 
retrospective review of 68 patients  undergoing hip and knee  revision  surgery  indicated  that C-reactive protein  (CRP)  
was significantly  higher  in patients  with infection  compared  with those  with loosening (sensitivity  of 79% for all 
prostheses) ; however , a normal  CRP  level  did not exclude  infection  [49].

a specificity  of 81% to 86% for the diagnosis  of prosthetic  knee  infection  when  a cutoff  of ≥13.5 mg/L  is used [44]. 
Although CRP  can be elevated  after surgery,  under  normal  circumstances  it generally  returns  to baseline within  2 
months  [44]. A large multicenter  study found CRP  and joint aspiration  to be the most  useful  tools  to diagnose  
infection  [50]. In an attempt  to construct  an algorithm  for evaluating  TKA infection,  Savarino  et al [51] found that 
abnormal  results  for at least 2 of 3 tests (CRP  [cutoff  0.93 mg/L],  ESR [cutoff 27 mm/h],  and fibrinogen  [cutoff  
432 mg/dL])  led to accurate results for the diagnosis  of infection  (sensitivity, 93%;  specificity,  100%;  accuracy,  
97%) . More  recently,  interle ukin-6  has also shown  promise  for diagnosing  infection , with higher  predictive  values 
than most  other  serologic  markers [52], and has shown  excellent  sensitivity  for detecting  infection  after TKA when  
combined with CRP  [53]. The American  Academy  of Orthopaedi c Surgeons  (AAOS ) guidelines  strongly  
recommend  the use of ESR, CRP , and serum  interleukin -6 testing  for patients  being assessed  for periprosthetic  joint 
infection  [54]. Serologic  tests can be hard to interpret  when  underlying inflamm atory  arthropathy is present  [28]. 
More  recently,  the use of an alpha -defensin  laboratory  test has been  described  for the diagnosis  of periprosthetic

Within  1 to 2 years after prosthesis surgery,  the differential  diagnosis  for increased  periprosthetic  activity  would  
include  postoperative  change;  however,  with serial  imaging,  this postoperative activity  should decrease over time,  
whereas activity  increasing  over time would be suggestive of a prosthetic  complication, such as a periprosthetic  
fracture,  aseptic loosening,  or infection. Therefore,  no conclusion should  be drawn  on an isolated  bone  scan unless

Local  recurrence  rates  of bone  sarcomas  are reported  to be approximately  10% to 15%

aggressive  bone  tumors,  with postrecurrence  5-year survival  rates  reported  approximately  15% to 30% in patients  
with osteosarcoma  and 5% in patients  with Ewing  sarcoma  [60,62] . Factors  associated  with poorer  prognosis  in 
patients  with osteosarcoma  were  size of local  recurrence  (>5 cm) and presence  of distant  metastasis  [60]. 
Recommendations  for local  recurrence  surveillance  imaging  vary amongst  expert  guidelines,  although  all 
acknowledge  the benefit  of clinical  evaluation.  Locally  recurrent  bone  tumors  can often  present  as a soft tissue  
mass,  and in a study  of osteosarcoma  local  recurrences,  the majority  (approximately  75%)  were  soft tissue  masses  
rather  than bone  lesions  [60]. Some  guidelines  recommend  clinical  exam ination  to be performed  solely , whereas  
others  recommend  in combination  with imaging  [49,51,52,63] . Time  to recurrence  also varies  with tumor  histology.  
Most  osteosarcoma  local  recurrences  have  been  shown  to occur  within  5 years  of resection.  However,  late 
recurrence  of both osteosarcoma  and Ewing  sarcoma  have  been  reported  [60,61] . In a study  of locally  recurrent  
osteosarcoma,  survival  rates  decreased  from  30% at 5 years  to 13% at 10 years,  suggesting  long-term follow -up 
beyond  5 years  is beneficial.

FDG -PET/CT  Whole  Body  
A meta -analysis  of FDG -PET/CT  for the staging  of patients  with osteosarcoma  demonstrated  an overall  sensitivity  
of 93% and a specificity  of 97% for detection  of bone  metastases  [6]. Coverage  of a whole  body  FDG -PET/CT  
varies  and usually  extends  either  from  skull  base to thighs  or skull  vertex  to feet. A study  of FDG -PET/CT  in 
patients  with sarcoma  and melanoma  showed  inclusion  of the entire  lower  extremities  does not add additional  
benefit  in identifying  metastases  [31]. 
FDG -PET/CT  is considered  superior  to Tc-99m bone  scan in the detection  of osseous  metastases.  Literature  has 
concluded  this in both general  oncologic  and bone  sarcoma  populations  [30]. FDG -PET/C T is also superior  to CT 
imaging  in this regard.  Quartuccio  et al [22] studied  64 pediatric  patients  with bone  sarcoma  and found  greater  
accuracy  of FDG -PET/CT  (85%  accuracy)  versus  CT (44% accuracy)  in detecting  bone  metastases  during  initial  
staging  of patients  with Ewing  sarcoma.  There  are mixed  conclusions  when  comparing  FDG -PET/CT  versus  MRI  
whole  body  in detecting  osseous  metastases  in general  oncology  populations  [32-34]. In a small  study  of 20 patients  
with Ewing  sarcoma  comparing  FDG -PET/CT  with MRI  whole  body , a single  patient  had a false -positive  bone

A more  recent  retrospective  single -
center  study  of 68 patients  with extremity  soft tissue  sarcomas  (28%  recurrence  rate) followed  with US and MRI  
found  a sensitivity  of 88% and specificity  of 94% in the detection  of local  recurrences  with US, with a negative  
predictive  value  of 96%;  both US false -negative  lesions  were  identified  with MRI  in this study  [84]. 
Summary  of Recommendations  
• Variant  1: CT chest  without  IV contrast  is usually  appropriate  for the initial  staging  of malignant  or aggressive  
primary  musculoskeletal  tumors  in the evaluation  of pulmonary  metastases.  
• Variant  2: FDG -PET/CT  whole  body  is usually  appropriate  for the initial  staging  of malignant  or aggressive  
primary  musculoskeletal  tumors  in the evaluation  of extrapulmonary  metastases.  Although  the panel  did not 
agree  on recommending  MRI whole  body  without  IV contrast  or fluoride  PET/CT  whole  body,  because  there  
is insufficient  medical  literature  to conclude  whether  these  patients  would  benefit  from  the procedure,  its use 
may be appropriate.   
• Variant  3: CT chest  without  IV contrast  is usually  appropriate  for surveillance  of pulmonary  metastasis  in 
patients  with malignant  or aggressive  primary  musculoskeletal  tumors  with no suspected  or known  recurrence.  
• Variant  4: Radiography  area of interest , combined  with MRI  area of interest  without  and with IV contrast  or 
MRI  area of interest  without  IV contrast  are usually  appropriate  for surveillance  of local  recurrence  in patients  
with malignant  or aggressive  primary  bone  tumors.  These  procedures  are complementary,  and both are indicated  
in this patient  population.

ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 11 Malignant or Aggressive Primary Musculoskeletal Tumor  Radi ography  Area  of Interest  
Not only is radiography  useful  to evaluate  for bone  tumor  recurrence,  but it is also an invaluable  adjunct  to MRI 
interpretation.  When  hardware  is present,  even  with modern  metal -artifact  reduction  techniques,  radiography  can 
visualize  the bone -metal  or bone -cement  interface , which  can be critical  to evaluate  for tumor  recurrence.  
Radiographs  are recommended  for the surveillance  of local  recurrence  of malignant  or aggressive  primary  bone  
tumors.  
US Area  of Interest  
US is not useful  for evaluating  bone  lesions  when  there  is no extraosseous  tumor  extension.  However,  US may be 
beneficial  if a mass  is identified  clinically.  There  is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of US as surveillance  
for asymptomatic  local  recurrence  of malignant  or aggressive  primary  bone  tumors.  
Variant  5: Malignant  or aggressive  primary  soft tissue  tumor.  Surveillance  for local  recurrence.  
The body regions covered in this clinical scenario are abdomen, ankle, chest, elbow,  shoulder , thigh, foot, forearm, 
hand, arm, knee, pelvis, leg, and wrist.  
Local  recurrence  rates  of soft tissue  sarcomas  have  been  reported  to occur  at rates  of 5% to 25% in larger  historic  
studies  [69-72]. Although  rates  of local  recurrence  following  primary  resection  depend  on tumor  histology  and 
grade,  several  other  factors  have  been  identified  that increase  risk.

Selection  
bias was a limitation  of both of these  retrospective  studies  because  the rationale  of which  modality  used to screen  
was not known  or reported.  Additionally,  the Gamboa  et al [45] study  included  151 patients  with retroperitoneal  
sarcoma , which  has a high rate of local  recurrence;  this group  was overrepresented  in the CT imaging  group , which  
had the worse  survival  rate. A prospective  randomized  trial of 500 patients  with resected  extremity  bone  and soft 
tissue  sarcomas  without  baseline  metastases  showed  noninferiority  of chest  radiography  compared  with CT chest  
with similar  overall  survival  (56%  versus  53% respectively)  and recurrence -free survival  (59%  versus  54% 
respectively)  when  used for lung surveillance  [53,54] . 
FDG -PET/CT  Whole  Body  
Although  FDG -PET/CT  is not as sensitive  for detecting  pulmonary  metastases  as CT chest  imaging,  it has been  
shown  to be more  specific  and therefore  may be useful  as a problem -solving  tool when  an indeterminate  pulmonary  
nodule  is detected  on diagnostic  chest  CT. A study  comparing  staging  and follow -up imaging  studies  in 41 children  
with primary  bone  sarcomas  showed  greater  sensitivity  of CT chest  (93%)  versus  FDG -PET/CT  (80%)  in detecting  
pulmonary  metastases  (although  specificity  was higher  with FDG -PET/CT  at 96% compared  with 87% for CT 
chest).  Of the false -negative  FDG -PET/CT  results  in that study,  half were  pulmonary  nodules  <10 mm [15].

In line with the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations for patients  
ages 65 and older being screened for osteoporosis, patients  >65 years of age may be considered at risk for 
osteoporotic fracture when presenting with LBP . 
Additionally,  for those  patients without  neurologic  compromise  and who present  with minor  risk factors for cancer,  
inflammatory  back  disease  (eg, ankylosing spondylitis), vertebral  compression  fracture,  or symptomatic  spinal  
stenosis,  imaging  should be considered  after a trial of therapy  [4]. 
In the majority  of patients, no specific pathology for LBP can be identified. Also,  studies have  shown  imaging  
abnormalities  in a substantial  number  of people  without back  pain [11-13]. The challenge for the clinician, therefore,  
is to distin guish the small  segment  within  this large patient  population that should be evaluated  further because of 
suspicion  of a more  serious  problem  or identify  pathology that requires intervention . 
Other  nonspine  causes of LBP can have overlap  in clinical  presentation,  including inflammatory  arthritis  and other  
systemic conditions , such as pelvic,  renal,  vascular,  or gastrointestinal  etiologies.  If an inflammatory  etiology  is 
suspected  as the cause of LBP, such as ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic  spondylitis, reactive arthritis, or 
inflammatory  bowel  disease– related  spine  disorders,  please see the ACR  Appropriateness Criteria® topic  on 
“Inflammatory Back Pain: Known or Suspected Axial Spondyloarthropathy ” [14].

red flag. However, an important age-related risk factor for spinal fracture presenting as LBP  is osteoporosis.  As 
bone mass decreases slowly over time, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age, and differs by sex, race, 
ethnicity  [10], and comorbidities.

flags,  only a history  of cancer  has been  shown  to increase  the probability  of finding spinal  malignancy  [61]. In a 
patient  suspected  of having cancer,  MRI without  and with IV contrast  is considered  superior  in evaluation  of 
localizing  disease (intramedullary, intradural -extramedullary,  and extradural)  as well as assessing  extent  of the

Summary of Literature Review  
Background/Introduction 
Chronic knee pain affects tens of millions of people  in the United States annually , with the pain sometimes highly 
disabling and often negatively impacting the patient’s quality of life. Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and 
it can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain 
with the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. 
Typically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain 
persists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  
imaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated 
that approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the 
prior year) radiographs [2 ]. 
This document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  ≥5 years of age.

MR Arthrography  Knee  
MR arthrography is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with s igns of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  
US Knee  
US is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  
Bone Scan Knee  
Radionuclide bone scan is usually not indicated to evaluate patients with signs of prior  (chronic) osseous knee 
injury.  
Image -Guided Aspiration Knee  
Joint aspiration is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  
Summary of Recommendations  
• Variant 1:  Radiographs  of the knee  are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of  chronic knee pain in 
patients greater than or equal to 5 years of age.  
• Variant 2:  MRI knee without  IV contrast is usually appropriate in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of 
age with chronic knee pain when initial knee  radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion.  
• Variant 3:  MRI knee without  IV contrast is usually appropriate  in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of 
age with chronic knee pain when initial knee radiographs demonstrate OCD,  loose bodies, or history of 
cartilage or meniscal repair.  
• Variant 4:  (1) MRI knee without IV contrast  or (2)  knee aspiration or (3)  CT knee without  IV contrast may 
be appropriate  in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of age with chronic knee pain when initial 
radiographs de monstrate degenerative changes or chondrocalcinosis. While MRI knee without  IV contrast 
may be appropriate more often, knee aspiration and CT knee without IV contrast may be appropriate in 
specific instances detailed in the narrative. On occasion, these ex aminations  may complement each other  with 
more than one being appropriate .

painful or asymptomatic knee not significantly different in patients 45 to 55 years of age [20,21]. 
Bone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the 
subchondral bone.  New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or 
patients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee 
pain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the 
origin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. 
Subchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed 
spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to 
elderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs 
often initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, 
and progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is 
suspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria
® 
topic on “ Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae ” [28].

location for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Traumatic shoulder pain is shoulder pain believed to be directly attributed to a traumatic event, either acute or 
chronic. This pain may be the result of either fracture (the clavicle, scapula, or proximal humerus) or soft -tissue 
injury (most commonly of the rotator cuff, acromioclavicular ligaments, or labroligamentous complex). The 
incidence of traumatic shoulder injuries is difficult to determine because some injury types, such as low-grade 
acromioclavicular separations or acute rotator cuff tears, are likely under -reported because patients  do not seek 
immediate medical treatment. However, as with many traumatic injuries, traumatic shoulder pain tends to 
disproportionately involve young adults and male patients [ 1,2]. 
The etiology of traumatic shoulder pain can often be made based on clinical examination, radiographs, and 
mechanism of injury. Traumatic shoulder injuries can generally be separated into in juries requiring acute surgical 
management and injuries in which conservative management can be attempted prior to considering surgical 
treatment. Unstable or significantly displaced fractures and joint instability are injuries most likely requiring acute 
surgical treatment.

Score: 0.7380121581575566","condition: shoulder pain traumatic

Most soft -tissue injuries (such as labral tears and rotator cuff tears) can undergo a period of 
conservative management prior to considering surgery. However, in addition to the specific imaging findings 
related to a traumatic injury, indications and timing of surgical treatment of many traumatic shoulder injuries are 
dependent on patient age, comorbidities, current activity level, and expected activity level.  
Imaging of chronic shoulder pain is beyond the scope of this topic  and is cove red in the  ACR Appropriateness 
Criteria® on “Shoulder Pain– Atraumatic ” [3]. 
Discussion o f Procedures  by Variant  
Variant 1:  Traumatic shoulder pain. Any etiology . Initial imaging . 
Radiography Shoulder  
Radiographs are the preferred initial study performed in the setting of traumatic shoulder pain . They can delineate 
shoulder malalignment and most shoulder fractures [ 4,5]. A standard set of shoulder radiographs for trauma 
should include at least three  views: anterior -posterior (AP) views in internal and external rotation and an axillary 
or scapula-Y view. Axillary or scapula-Y views are vital in evaluating traumatic shoulder injuries as 
acromioclavicular and glenohumeral dislocations can be misclassified on AP  views [6,7]. Radiographs provide 
good delineation of bony anatomy to assess for fracture and appropriate shoulder alignment, which are the two 
primary concerns in management of acute traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs should also be performed upright 
since malalignment of the shoul der can be under -represented on supine radiographs [ 4]. Additional views, such as 
the Bernageau view, have been sho wn to be effective in demonstrating the degree of bone loss of the glenoid or 
humeral head [ 8]. 
CT Shoulder  
Computed tomography ( CT) is better able than radiogr aphs to characteriz e fracture patterns [ 9-11].

Bone Scan  Shoulder  
There is no role for bone scintigraphy in assessment of Bankart or Hill -Sachs lesions.  
Variant 6: Traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs normal.  Physical examination and history consistent 
with dislocation event  or instability . Next imaging study. 
Shoulder dislocation or instability is most co mmon in the anterior direction. Younger patients are more likely to 
have labroligamentous injury and persistent instability after dislocation compared with older patients [54]. Older 
patients are more likely to have rotator cuff tears in association with shoulder dislocation [ 55]. Coexisting 
humeral avulsion of the glenohumeral ligament and significant glenoid bone loss have been found in up to 10% of 
patients with recurrent shoulder instability [ 56], which underscores the need to assess both osseous and 
labroligamentous pathology in patients with shoulder dislocation or instability. Glenoid morphology and bone 
loss can play a significant factor in recurrent shoulder dislocations [15, 16,57], which may require bone grafting in 
order to restore stability [ 57].

However, this is not common 
practice, and US has been shown to be inferior to MRI in diagnosing the common structural abnormalities 
associated with shoulder instability, such as labroligamentous injuries, Hill -Sachs lesions, and partial rotator cuff 
tears [17].

MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography  has been reported to have a high sensitivity for detection of labral injury, r anging from 86%  to 
100% [20,59,62-65] ; however, the issue of  selection bias is inherent in the design of many of these retrospective

ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 8 Shoulder Pain –Traumatic  Variant 2: Traumatic shoulder pain. Nonlocalized shoulder pain. Negative radiographs . Next imaging 
study. 
Appropriately positioned  radiographs can exclude shoulder dislocation and most displaced fractures as the 
etiology for post -traumatic shoulder pain. In the setting of normal shoulder radiographs, the most common causes 
of post -traumatic shoulder pain are soft -tissue injuries such  as rotator cuff and labral tears.  
MRI Shoulder  
Noncontrast MRI is a reasonable imaging study in the setting of acute nonlocalized traumatic shoulder pain and 
noncontributory radiographs. In the acute trauma setting, noncontrast MRI may be preferred to MR arthrography , 
as acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint effusion for assessment of intra -articular 
soft-tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic 
pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [34,35]. MRI is also sensitive for diagnosing bone marrow 
contusion and has  been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries in pediatric patients [ 36,37]. 
MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography has been found to be superior to noncontrast MRI in the diagnosis of labroligamentous and 
partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [17,19]. In the acute trauma setting, however, noncontrast MRI may be 
preferred to MR arthrography because acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint 
effusion for assessment of intra-arti cular soft -tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing 
extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [ 34,35]. MRI is also sensitive 
for diagnosing bone marrow contusion and has been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries 
in pediatric patients [ 36,37].

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Traumatic shoulder pain is shoulder pain believed to be directly attributed to a traumatic event, either acute or 
chronic. This pain may be the result of either fracture (the clavicle, scapula, or proximal humerus) or soft -tissue 
injury (most commonly of the rotator cuff, acromioclavicular ligaments, or labroligamentous complex). The 
incidence of traumatic shoulder injuries is difficult to determine because some injury types, such as low-grade 
acromioclavicular separations or acute rotator cuff tears, are likely under -reported because patients  do not seek 
immediate medical treatment. However, as with many traumatic injuries, traumatic shoulder pain tends to 
disproportionately involve young adults and male patients [ 1,2]. 
The etiology of traumatic shoulder pain can often be made based on clinical examination, radiographs, and 
mechanism of injury. Traumatic shoulder injuries can generally be separated into in juries requiring acute surgical 
management and injuries in which conservative management can be attempted prior to considering surgical 
treatment. Unstable or significantly displaced fractures and joint instability are injuries most likely requiring acute 
surgical treatment.

Most soft -tissue injuries (such as labral tears and rotator cuff tears) can undergo a period of 
conservative management prior to considering surgery. However, in addition to the specific imaging findings 
related to a traumatic injury, indications and timing of surgical treatment of many traumatic shoulder injuries are 
dependent on patient age, comorbidities, current activity level, and expected activity level.  
Imaging of chronic shoulder pain is beyond the scope of this topic  and is cove red in the  ACR Appropriateness 
Criteria® on “Shoulder Pain– Atraumatic ” [3]. 
Discussion o f Procedures  by Variant  
Variant 1:  Traumatic shoulder pain. Any etiology . Initial imaging . 
Radiography Shoulder  
Radiographs are the preferred initial study performed in the setting of traumatic shoulder pain . They can delineate 
shoulder malalignment and most shoulder fractures [ 4,5]. A standard set of shoulder radiographs for trauma 
should include at least three  views: anterior -posterior (AP) views in internal and external rotation and an axillary 
or scapula-Y view. Axillary or scapula-Y views are vital in evaluating traumatic shoulder injuries as 
acromioclavicular and glenohumeral dislocations can be misclassified on AP  views [6,7]. Radiographs provide 
good delineation of bony anatomy to assess for fracture and appropriate shoulder alignment, which are the two 
primary concerns in management of acute traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs should also be performed upright 
since malalignment of the shoul der can be under -represented on supine radiographs [ 4]. Additional views, such as 
the Bernageau view, have been sho wn to be effective in demonstrating the degree of bone loss of the glenoid or 
humeral head [ 8]. 
CT Shoulder  
Computed tomography ( CT) is better able than radiogr aphs to characteriz e fracture patterns [ 9-11].

Bone Scan  Shoulder  
There is no role for bone scintigraphy in assessment of Bankart or Hill -Sachs lesions.  
Variant 6: Traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs normal.  Physical examination and history consistent 
with dislocation event  or instability . Next imaging study. 
Shoulder dislocation or instability is most co mmon in the anterior direction. Younger patients are more likely to 
have labroligamentous injury and persistent instability after dislocation compared with older patients [54]. Older 
patients are more likely to have rotator cuff tears in association with shoulder dislocation [ 55]. Coexisting 
humeral avulsion of the glenohumeral ligament and significant glenoid bone loss have been found in up to 10% of 
patients with recurrent shoulder instability [ 56], which underscores the need to assess both osseous and 
labroligamentous pathology in patients with shoulder dislocation or instability. Glenoid morphology and bone 
loss can play a significant factor in recurrent shoulder dislocations [15, 16,57], which may require bone grafting in 
order to restore stability [ 57].

ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 8 Shoulder Pain –Traumatic  Variant 2: Traumatic shoulder pain. Nonlocalized shoulder pain. Negative radiographs . Next imaging 
study. 
Appropriately positioned  radiographs can exclude shoulder dislocation and most displaced fractures as the 
etiology for post -traumatic shoulder pain. In the setting of normal shoulder radiographs, the most common causes 
of post -traumatic shoulder pain are soft -tissue injuries such  as rotator cuff and labral tears.  
MRI Shoulder  
Noncontrast MRI is a reasonable imaging study in the setting of acute nonlocalized traumatic shoulder pain and 
noncontributory radiographs. In the acute trauma setting, noncontrast MRI may be preferred to MR arthrography , 
as acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint effusion for assessment of intra -articular 
soft-tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic 
pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [34,35]. MRI is also sensitive for diagnosing bone marrow 
contusion and has  been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries in pediatric patients [ 36,37]. 
MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography has been found to be superior to noncontrast MRI in the diagnosis of labroligamentous and 
partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [17,19]. In the acute trauma setting, however, noncontrast MRI may be 
preferred to MR arthrography because acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint 
effusion for assessment of intra-arti cular soft -tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing 
extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [ 34,35]. MRI is also sensitive 
for diagnosing bone marrow contusion and has been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries 
in pediatric patients [ 36,37].

practice, and US has been shown to be inferior to MRI in diagnosing the common structural abnormalities

Radiography Area  of Interest  
Initial imaging  assessment  of a suspected  musculoskeletal  soft tissue mass  should almost  invariably  begin with 
radiographic  evaluation  and is advocated  by the European Society  for Medical  Oncology– European Reference  
Network  Clinical Practice  Guidelines  for rare adult  solid  cancers (ESMO -EURACAN)  [9]. Although often

identified  in 27% of cases,  bone  involvement  in 22% of cases,  and intrinsic  fat in 11% of cases [10]. Specifically,  
radiographic  findings  can be diagnostic  or highly  character istic,  such as in the identification  of phleboliths  within  a 
hemangioma,  the osteocartilaginous  masses  of synovial  chondromatosis,  or the peripherally  more  mature  
ossification  of myositis  ossificans,  to name  just a few. In addition, radiographs  can be diagnostic  of an unsuspected  
skeletal  abnormality  or deformity  that may manifest  as a soft tissue mass.

Radiography Area  of Interest  
Initial imaging  assessment  of a suspected  musculoskeletal  soft tissue mass  should almost  invariably  begin with 
radiographic  evaluation  and is advocated  by ESMO -EURACAN [9]. Radiographs  remain  the modality  best suited  
for the initial assessment  of a suspected  soft tissue mass  and are the initial study  of choice for orthopedic  oncologists  
[25,26] . However,  radiographs  have  limitations  and may not reveal  an abnormality  when  a mass is small, deep -
seated,  nonmineralized,  or in an area with complex  anatomy  such as the flank,  paraspinal  region,  groin,  or deep  soft 
tissues of the hands  and feet [11]. 
US Area  of Interest  
The diagnostic  accuracy  of US is considerably  less when  lesions outside  the subcutaneous tissue are included.  It is 
also less reliable  for defining deep  masses in large anatomical  areas [27]. Although a recent  prospective  study of 
US accuracy  in the characterization  of 134 histologically  proven  deep  soft tissue masses showed  promising results,  
there were only a small  number  of malignancies in the study cohort , and the investigators  had a high level  of US 
expertise [28].

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
A variety  of benign and malignant  processes may present  clinically  as a soft tissue  mass.  The behavior  of a mass,  
whether  nonaggressive,  indeterminant,  or aggressive,  can often  be discerned  based  on history  and physical  
examination.  However,  when  a benign clinical diagnosis  cannot  be confidently provided,  further  characterization  
of a soft tissue mass  with imaging  is warranted  [1]. Urgent  imag ing requests should be sought  for masses  that are 
>5 cm in diameter,  deep  in location, or have  shown  rapid  growth [2]. Modern imaging  techniques  allow  for a 
detailed  analysis of the morphology  of a soft tissue mass  as well as further insight  into its biologic  activity , which  
informs  the interpreter  on diagnosis  and appropriate  next steps in management  [3,4].  
The purpose  of this document  is to identify  the most  appropriate  imaging  study(ies)  to order  for the assessment  of 
a soft tissue  mass  based  on the most  frequently encountered  clinical  scenarios in medical  practice.

Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  
usually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, 
osteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite 
versus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess 
with radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton’s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other 
causes of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg’s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals 
or soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . 
Though radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in 
patients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The 
combination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a 
specificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15].

ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 4 Chronic Foot Pain  Discussion of Procedures by Variant  
Variant 1: Chronic foot pain. Unknown etiology. Initial imaging.  
Bone Scan Foot  
There is no relevant literature  to support t he use of nuclear medicine studies as the first imaging  study  in the 
evaluation of chronic foot pain.  
CT Foot  
There is no relevant literature to support the use of CT as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot 
pain.  
MRI Foot  
There is no r elevant literature  to support the use of MRI as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot

Radiography Foot  
Conventional radiography can be useful to distinguish among different causes of chronic foot pain and is usually 
the first imag ing study in evaluating patients with chronic foot pain.  
The value of radiographs in the diagnosis of tarsal coalitions has been extensively demonstrated. Overall 
sensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs 
in the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral 
and oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar 
coalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs 
on the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have 
been found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable 
methods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  
Radiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review 
by Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for 
radiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.  
Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain.

Imaging findings  should not be interpreted  in isolation. Clinical  features that suggest  osteomyelitis  include  an 
ulcer  area >2 cm², an elevated  erythrocyte  sedimentation  rate level  of >70 mm/hour,  positive probe -to-bone  test, a 
nonhealing  ulcer  for 6 months,  erythema,  fever,  and elevated  white blood cell (WBC) count  [2,5,6]. A negative  
probe -to-bone  test may exclude  the diagnosis  of osteomyelitis  with a high negative  predictive  value  [7]. The 
Infectious  Diseases Society  of American  recommends performing  the probe -to-bone  test on any diabetic  foot 
infection  with an open wound [8]. Deep  wound cultures correlate well with osseous cultures and provide  a 
sensitive method in assessing  and targeting  likely  pathogens  that cause osseous infections  [9]. 
For the diabetic  foot with a clinical  examination  suggesting crepitus where soft-tissue gas associated  with wet 
gangrene  is suspected,  please see the ACR  Appropria teness  Criteria® topic  on Suspected  Osteomyelitis,  Septic  
Arthritis, or Soft Tissue Infection  (Excluding  Spine  and Diabetic Foot)  for appropriate  guidance  [10]. 
Discussion  of Procedures  by Variant  
Variant  1: Suspected  osteomyelitis of the foot in patients  with  diabetes  mellitus. Initial imaging.  
Radiography Foot  
Radiographs  are useful  as the initial screening  examination.  They  evaluate anatomic detail  and previous  surgeries  
and are useful  to evaluate for other  causes of pain, such as radiopaque  foreign  body,  soft-tissue gas, fracture,  
degenerative changes,  neuropathic  arthropathy , or tumor.  Radiographs  are insensitive  in the detection  of early  
stages of acute osteomyelitis  [11].

CT is also useful to 
evaluate nonunion of sesamoid fractures in symptomatic patients with persistent bone marrow edema on MRI. 
Abnormalitie s in sesamoid position, which may be present in turf toe, hallux valgus, or osteoarthritis can also be 
assessed with CT [29] . CT is considered a useful and reliable method to determine the extent of necrosis in 
Freiberg’s infraction, which represents the main determining factor in the outcome [30]. There is no evidence in the 
literature supporting the routine use of contrast -enhanced CT imaging in the diagnosis of any of the conditions 
discussed above. Given the use of conventional arthrography in the detection of plantar plate tears, CT arthrography 
could presumably be of use in this setting [31] . 
MRI Foot  
MRI is useful in the diagnosis of several conditions affecting the hallucal sesamoid bones,  including fractures, acu te 
and chronic stress related changes, and avascular necrosis, and a variety of MRI findings have been described in 
the literature [12]. Contrast administration is not routinely performed in the assessment of noninfectious and/or

Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  
usually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, 
osteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite 
versus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess 
with radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton’s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other 
causes of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg’s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals 
or soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . 
Though radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in 
patients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The 
combination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a 
specificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15]. 
US Foot  
Ultrasound (US) is usually not indicate d as the first imaging  study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain, but may 
be performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of pathologic conditions of the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, 
and other conditions such as tarsal tunnel syndrome, Morton’s  neuroma , plantar plate tears,  and intermetatarsal 
bursitis. 
Variant 2: Persistent posttraumatic foot pain. Radiographs negative or equivocal. Clinical concern includes

Although there is no relevant literature  to support the routine clinical use of US in the 
diagnosis of CRPS type II, high-resolu tion US may have a role giving its increasing use in nerve assessment [23] .

Clinical concern includes sesamoiditis, Morton’s  neuroma, intermetatarsal bursitis, chronic plantar plate 
injury, or Freiberg’s infraction. Next imaging study.  
Bone Scan Foot  
Planar b one scintigraphy has low anatomic resolution and has been shown to be a nonspecific technique to assess 
the hallucal sesamoids [24]. However, bone scintigraphy with single -photon emission computed tomography 
(SPECT)/CT increases contrast resolution and anatomic localization of foci with increased osteoblastic activity  
[25]. Bone scintigraphy may demonstrate increased uptake in pathologic conditions affecting the fir st metatarsal 
sesamoids not evident on radiographs. A less dramatic uptake is noted in stress fractures, which may be helpful to 
differentiate between them and acute fractures [26]. When an indeter minate linear lucency is visualized on 
radiographs, a negative bone scintigraphy suggest s sesamoid bipartition [12] . Other conditions that may present 
positive findings on Tc -99m -methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scint igraphy include sesamoiditis, 
inflammatory or deposition arthropathies, osteoarthritis , and osteonecrosis [39]. In Freiberg’s infraction, a 
photopenic center with a hyperactive collar may be identified on early stages on high -resolution Tc -99m -MDP bone 
scintigraphy [27]. 
CT Foot  
CT may be useful to confirm suspected sesamoid stress fractures on radiographs and to distinguish between a stress 
fracture and a bipartite sesamoid with more precision than conventional radiography [28] .

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Acute injuries  to the foot are frequently  encountered  in the setting  of the emergency  room  and in general  practice.  
The clinical  indications  for imaging  (known as the Ottawa rules)  have  been  developed  to minimize  unnecessary  
radiographs , and their utility  is well documented by multiple  studies.  The most  commonly  accepted  form  of these  
rules is the following:  
A series of foot radiographs  is required  only if there  is pain in the midfoot  and any one of the 
following:  1) point  bone  tenderness of the navicular;  2) point  bone  tenderness of the base of the fifth 
metatarsal;  or 3) inability  to bear weight  or to walk  4 steps (immediately  after the injury  or at the 
emergency  department) .

ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 7 Acute Trauma to the Foot  injuries  in midtarsal  (Chopart) sprains,  which  frequently  accompany  acute ankle  injuries  [52,53] . If radiographs  
are negative,  MRI can be obtained in select  patients  with forefoot  pain because of its increased  sensitivity  for the 
early  detection  of metatarsal  head  subchondral  fracture  [54]. 
Lisfranc  Injury  
MRI has been  advocated  as a sensitive diagnostic  test in evaluation  of Lisfranc ligamentous  complex  (especially  
if the patient  is not able to bear weight),  and 3-D volumetric  acquisitions  have  proven superiority  over orthogonal  
proton  density  fat-suppressed  imaging [33,38,41- 45]. There is a high correlation  between  MRI and intraoperative  
findings  for an unstable  Lisfranc injury  [44]. In the patient  with a suspected  Lisfranc injury  and normal  
radiographs,  the literature  supports  further advanced  imaging  by MRI  and CT [21,33,43,46] . 
Turf Toe and Plantar  Plate Injuries 
MRI is the preferred  imaging method for evaluating  suspected  “turf  toe” and lesser  metatarsal  plantar  plate  injury  
by directly  evaluating  the soft-tissue structures of the capsuloligamentous  complex  as well as assessing  chondral  
and osteochondral  lesions [29,55,56] . 
Acute  Tendinous  Rupture  
MRI tends  to be used as a screening  tool when  one is not certain  of the specific tendon injury  or if concomitant  
osseous injury  is suspected.  Both  MRI and US have  been  shown  to be sensitive  for the diagnosis  of acute tendon  
rupture  or dislocation  in the foot [39].

ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 10 Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture  Variant 5: Confirmed stress (fatigue) fracture, excluding vertebrae . Follow -up imaging study for  “return -
to-play” evaluation . 
See variants 1  through  3. On initial diagnosis, MRI can be used to  predict t ime to return to play in athletes. 
Fredericson et al  [48] retrospectively correlated return to activity with an MRI grading system based on the 
pattern of periosteal and marrow edema on T1-weighted  and fat -suppressed T 2-weighted sequences. Similar 
findings were confirmed in other studies  [49-51] , including  that the finding of abnormal cortical signal intensity 
or a fracture line was of prognostic value [ 51] and that MRI performed better in predicting return to activity than 
radiographs , bone scintigraphy, or CT [50,52]. 
A recent prospective study in university athletes found that MRI grading s everity, total-body bone mineral density 
evaluated by dual -energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and location of injury (ie , cortical or trabecular bone)  
were important variables for predicting time to full return to sport [ 31]. In this study, periosteal edema as 
described by Fredericson et al [ 48] was not associated with return to sport . Using the modified grading scale and a 
multiple regression model, for every 1- unit increase in MRI grade, the time to full return to sport increased by 
approximately 48 days [31] . Furthermore, trabecular st ress injuries (eg , femur neck and pubic bone ) were 
associated with a longer time to return to sport than cortical bone stress injuries. In addition, decreased bone 
mineral density leads to increased time to return to sport . Therefore, bone mineral density provides additional 
diagnostic and prognostic information [31]. The model of MRI  grade, trabecular versus cortical bone sit e, and 
total-body bone mineral density a ccounted for 68% of the variation in time to return to sport [ 31].

Finally, stress fractures of the femoral head are high  risk in healthy patients and , if not recognized promptly, have 
increased  rates of delayed union, nonunion, displacement, and avascular necrosis [17]. Given the importance of 
recognizing these high-risk fractures in the femoral head and neck, MRI is the preferred second -line study after  
initial negative  radiographs to prevent delayed diagnosis.  
Variant 3: Suspected stress (fatigue) fracture, excluding hip  and vertebrae. Negative radiographs. Next 
imaging study.  
See variant 2. Certain stress fractures are considered high  risk based on a tendency for nonunion or delayed union. 
High -risk stress fractures include the anterior tibial diaphysis, lateral femoral neck and femoral head (see variant 
2), patella, medial malleolus, navicular, fifth metatarsal base, proximal second metatarsal, tibial hallux sesamoid, 
and talus  [43]. 
The second -line test to diagnose a stress fracture should be guided by the location of the patient ’s pain and 
likelihood of high-risk injury. A follow -up radiographic examination has increased sensitivity compared to initial 
radiographs [8] but is less sensitive than MRI. MRI is extremely sensitive and demonstrates stress abnormalities 
as early as bone scintigraphy and with as much sensitivity [ 11-14]. The recent literature favors MRI as the 
procedure of choice for making an early diagnosis of both varieties of stress fractures [ 15-28 ]. MRI is also 
considerably more specifi c than bone scintigraphy [ 19,23]. Stress injuries in athletes that are not identified and 
managed in a timel y fashion can progress to more serious fractures. Preventive strategies, including identifying 
and modifying risk factors, may help deter progression to frank fractures [31,44,45]. 
A circumstance that deserves specific attention is the longitudinal stress fracture, particularly in the tibia. Up to 
25% may appear n ormal on radiographs, but CT or MRI findings are characteristic [ 13,46].

Furthermore, certain athletic activities often result in specific sites of fatigue  fracture, such as olecranon process 
fractures in javelin throwers and baseball pitchers, proximal femur and tibial stress fractures in runners, and  tarsal  
navicular stress fractures in basketball players [ 36-38] . Correlat ion of  clinical history, pattern , and site recognition 
with radiographic findings  is usually specific [1,2,4,5,7]. Nevertheless, stress fractures are frequently occult on 
initial radiographs  [1], with conventional radiographs having a sensitivity of 15% to 35% [8]. Early radiographic 
findings are often nonspecific (subtle periosteal reaction , gray cortex sign) or even nonexistent. Late radiographic 
findings are often suggestive in appearance  and include  linear sclerosis (often perpe ndicular to the major 
trabecular lines), periosteal reaction , patchy endosteal sclerosis, and soft -tissue swelling . Additionally, 
radiographs may remain negative depending on the timing of re imaging , the patient’s metabolic bone status, and 
the type and lo cation of the fracture. Thus, radiographs are specific but significantly insensitive. Despite this 
limitation, all authorities agree that radiographs should be the initial imaging modality; if the findings are 
conclusive, no further imaging need be perform ed.

• MRI without contrast and potentially total-body DXA provide prognostic information, which may help initial 
return -to-play evaluations.  
• Although insensitive, radiographs should be the initial imaging study of choice for suspected insufficiency 
fractures in the pelvis or hip.  
• When initial radiographs are negative in the setting of suspected insuffici ency fracture of the pelvis or hip, 
MRI without contrast is recommended, and CT without contrast remains a reasonable, less sensitive 
alternative.  
• Although insensitive, radiographs are the recommended initial imaging procedure for suspected insufficiency 
fractures in the lower extremities (excluding the pelvis and hip) .

Furthermore, MRI may als o demonstrate other reasons for occult pelvic pain, such as soft -tissue abnormalities or 
the subchondral hip or supra -acetabular stress fractures described in some osteoporotic patients [63]. The clinical 
differential diagnosis includes sacroiliitis from inflammatory or infectious causes, osteitis condensans ilii, and 
lumbosacral degenerative spondylosis  [60]. 
Variant 12: Suspect stress (fatigue or insufficiency) fracture of the long bones . Pregn ant patient. 
See variant 11. In the case of long bones, the fetus’ absorbed dose from radiography and CT will be substantially 
lower. Women can be reassured that benefit far outweighs the risk wi th regard to diagnostic imaging, as all 
radiographs and CT sc ans not involving the abdomen or pelvis hav e a predicted fetal absorbed dose of less than 1 
mGy  [80]. Radiographs should be the initial imaging evaluation because findings may be conclusive , in which 
case no further imaging should be performed. MRI does not use ionizing radiation and can  be used  as necessary to 
make the diagnosis.  
Summary of Recommendations  
• In the setting of a suspected fatigue fracture, the initial imaging test should be radiography of the area of 
interest, although it is not a sensitive examination. 
• If there is clinical concern  for a fatigue fracture of the hip and initial radiographs are negative, MRI without 
contrast should be performed because of the high risk of complications.  
• In the setting of a suspected fatigue fracture in a location other than the hip with initial negati ve radiographs, 
either repeat radiographs in 10  to 14 days or MRI without contrast may be appropriate depending on the 
location of pain and relative risk of complications secondary to stress fractures in that area.  
• If there is an immediate need -to-know sit uation to diagnose a stress fracture in the setting of negative 
radiographs, for example,  professional football player, then MRI w ithout contrast is recommended.

Imaging findings  should not be interpreted  in isolation. Clinical  features that suggest  osteomyelitis  include  an 
ulcer  area >2 cm², an elevated  erythrocyte  sedimentation  rate level  of >70 mm/hour,  positive probe -to-bone  test, a 
nonhealing  ulcer  for 6 months,  erythema,  fever,  and elevated  white blood cell (WBC) count  [2,5,6]. A negative  
probe -to-bone  test may exclude  the diagnosis  of osteomyelitis  with a high negative  predictive  value  [7]. The 
Infectious  Diseases Society  of American  recommends performing  the probe -to-bone  test on any diabetic  foot 
infection  with an open wound [8]. Deep  wound cultures correlate well with osseous cultures and provide  a

The Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention  National  Diabetes Statistics  Report  of 2017 states that 30.3 
million  people  in the United  States  have  diabetes (9.4%  of the population)  [1]. Diabetes-related  foot 
complications , such as soft-tissue infection, osteomyelitis , and neuropathic  osteoarthropathy,  account  for up to 
20% of all diabetic -related  North  American  hospital  admissions,  with up to $1.5 billion  spent  annually in the 
United  States  on diabetic  foot ulcer  care [2]. 
Neuropathic  changes in the foot are present  in about  1% of diabetics [3]. Neuropathic  osteoarthropathy  is a 
progressive  process affecting  the bones,  joints , and soft tissue of the foot and ankle.  Delay  in the diagnosis  may 
lead to derangement  of the bony architecture of the foot, deformity,  recurrent  foot ulcerations,  cellulitis,  
osteomyelitis , and amputation [4].

Variant  2: Soft-tissue swelling  without  ulcer.  Suspected  osteomyelitis or early  neuropathic  arthropathy  
changes of the foot in patients  with  diabetes mellitus. Additional imaging  following  radiographs.  
The likelihood  of developing osteomyelitis  without  an associated  wound or ulceration  is extremely  low. Almost  
all osteomyelitis  and soft-tissue abscesses of the diabetic  foot represent  areas of contiguous  infection  from  
adjacent  skin ulcerations and not hematogenous  seeding  [14]. Any imaging modality  performed  for this variant  
should be able to identify  soft-tissue infections,  tumors  and abscesses,  early  neuropathic  arthropathy,  or subtle  
fractures not revealed  on initial radiographs . Diabetic foot osteomyelitis  and neuroarthropathy  can be difficult  to 
differentiate  clinically.  The early  diagnosis  of neuropathic  disease prior  to the development  of radiographic  
change  is important, as these  patients  will be treated  with altered  footwear  and orthotics  to prevent  the progression  
to deformity.

Cervical spine CT is the preferred modality for the initia l assessment of cervical spine injury. However, CT is 
significantly inferior to MRI in identifying many soft-tissu e pathologies, such as spinal cord contusion, epidural 
hematoma, and nerve root avulsions, that can cause neur ologic deficits and require surgical intervention 
[40,41,43,57]. Therefore, CT should not be considered ad equate for excluding significant soft-tissue pathology in

Thoracic and Lumbar Spine Imaging 
Injuries to the thoracolumbar spine are even more prevalent than cervical spin e injury, with an estimated 4% to 
7% of patients presenting to the emergency department  with blunt trauma sustaining a fracture of the 
thoracolumbar spine [13,14]. An increasing rate of t horacolumbar spine fractures h as been seen in the United 
States over the past several decades, despite a decline in other motor vehicle–related injuries [15]. While the exact 
reason for this increase is uncertain, it is likely due to a combination of both increased detection of thoracolumbar 
spine injury and increased rate of seatbelt injury. Similar to cervical in juries, there is a wide spectrum of 
thoracolumbar spine injuries ranging from stable, minor soft -tissue injuries to unstable fracture dislocations that 
are often accompanied by neurologic injuries. In contrast  to the cervical spine, there are no widely used and 
validated criteria to help determine if th oracolumbar spine imaging is appropriate. 
Clinical examination has a low to very low sensitivit y for identifying thoracolumbar spine injuries [16-18]. 
Therefore, a low threshold should be maintained for screen ing the thoracolumbar spine with imaging in the setting 
of blunt trauma, particularly in older patients, who are at increased risk for spine fractures occurring in the setting 
of low-energy trauma, such as a fall from standing (ie,  fragility fractures), which are due to diminished bone 
mineralization commonly present in older patient populations . A low threshold for imaging of the thoracolumbar

Summary of Literature Review 
Introduction/Background 
Cervical Spine Imaging An estimated 3% to 4% of patients presenting to the emer gency department with blunt trauma have sustained an 
injury to the cervical spine [1,2]. Cervical spine injuries can range from stable minor soft-tissue injuries to 
unstable complex injury patterns resulting in complete disr uption of the cervical spine with possible neurologic or 
vascular injury. The wide spectrum of injury patterns can make the decision process for when to perform imaging 
and what type of imaging to perform challenging. Over utilization of MRI and CT imaging of the cervical spine 
can result in an extended emergency center visit while aw aiting imaging as well as iatrogenic injuries related to 
prolonged cervical collar placement [3], exposure to in travenous (IV) contrast, and exposure to radiation and 
high-power magnetic fields. On the other hand, failure to  identify an unstable cervical spine or cervical vascular 
injury can result in poor clinical outcomes.

Injury [5] 
 Simple rear-end motor vehicle crash 
 Patient in sitting position in emergency center 
 Patient ambulatory at any time after trauma 
 Delayed onset of neck pain 
 Absence of midline cervical spine tenderness 
Thoracic and Lumbar Spine Imaging 
Injuries to the thoracolumbar spine are even more prevalent than cervical spin e injury, with an estimated 4% to 
7% of patients presenting to the emergency department  with blunt trauma sustaining a fracture of the 
thoracolumbar spine [13,14]. An increasing rate of t horacolumbar spine fractures h as been seen in the United 
States over the past several decades, despite a decline in other motor vehicle–related injuries [15]. While the exact 
reason for this increase is uncertain, it is likely due to a combination of both increased detection of thoracolumbar 
spine injury and increased rate of seatbelt injury. Similar to cervical in juries, there is a wide spectrum of 
thoracolumbar spine injuries ranging from stable, minor soft -tissue injuries to unstable fracture dislocations that 
are often accompanied by neurologic injuries. In contrast  to the cervical spine, there are no widely used and 
validated criteria to help determine if th oracolumbar spine imaging is appropriate. 
Clinical examination has a low to very low sensitivit y for identifying thoracolumbar spine injuries [16-18]. 
Therefore, a low threshold should be maintained for screen ing the thoracolumbar spine with imaging in the setting 
of blunt trauma, particularly in older patients, who are at increased risk for spine fractures occurring in the setting 
of low-energy trauma, such as a fall from standing (ie,  fragility fractures), which are due to diminished bone 
mineralization commonly present in older patient populations . A low threshold for imaging of the thoracolumbar

It is important to acknowledge overlap of symptoms and examination findings. In the setting of spinal cord or

radiographs or noncontrast CT. Neurologic abnormalities. Next imaging study. 
CT Myelography Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
CT myelography can be performed to assess for traumatic spinal canal narrowing that is due to disc herniation or 
epidural hematoma and to assess for preganglionic nerve root avulsions. Ho wever, as with conventional CT, CT 
myelography is inferior to MRI in assessing cord contus ion, cord hemorrhage, and postganglionic nerve root 
injuries [40,41,43,57]. Performance of thoracolumbar CT myelogram can also be technically challenging, 
particularly in patients with suspected  unstable thoracolumbar spine injury. 
CT Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
CT does play a role in the initial assessment of thoracic and lumbar spine injury. However, CT is significantly 
inferior to MRI in identifying many soft-tissue pathologies,  such as cord contusion, epidural hematoma, and nerve 
root avulsions that can cause neurologic deficits re quiring surgical intervention [40,41,43,57]. Therefore, CT 
should not be considered adequate for excluding signifi cant soft-tissue pathology in patients presenting with 
thoracolumbar spine trauma and neurologic deficit. 
MRI Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
MRI should be performed in patients who have possible spinal  cord injury, in whom there is clinical concern for 
cord compression that is due to disc protrusion or hema toma, and in those suspected of ligamentous instability. 
MRI is valuable for characterizing the cause of myelopathy in  patients with spinal cord  injury. The severity of the 
injury—including extent of intramedullary hemorrhage , length of edema, and evidence of cord transection—
contributes to predicting outcome.

cervical collar in place. 
Variant 9: Age greater than or equal to 16 years. Blunt trauma meeting criteria for thoracic and lumbar 
imaging. Initial imaging. 
Imaging is a crucial component in assessment of thoracic and lumbar spine injury. Fr om 1998 to 2011, there was 
an adjusted annual increase of approximately 8% in thor acolumbar spine fractures in patients involved in motor 
vehicle collisions [15]. Thoracolumbar fractures are cha llenging to identify clinically, with only 48% to 75% of 
thoracolumbar injuries identified on clinical examination [16-18]. Unlike cervical injuries, well-defined clinical 
criteria have not been established to determine when thor acolumbar imaging is appropriate in the setting of blunt 
traumatic injury. Since clinical examination has poor sen sitivity for identifying thoracolumbar injuries, any high-
risk patient (mid line thoracolumbar tenderness, high-energ y mechanism of injury, or >60 years of age), as well as 
unexaminable patients (intoxicated, GCS <15, distracting injury), should undergo imaging of the thoracolumbar 
spine. Screening of the entire spine is advised, as an es timated 20% of spine injuries will have a second associated 
spinal injury at a noncontiguous level [26,27]. 
Radiography  Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
It is well established that CT outperforms radiographs in  the diagnosis of thoracolumbar spine fractures [104-
108]. Radiographs have a reported sens itivity of 49% to 62% for identifying thoracic spine fractures and 67% to 
82% sensitivity for identifying lumbar spine fractures [ 104,107,108] compared with the reported sensitivity of 
94% to 100% for identifying thoracolumbar spine fract ures using CT [104,107,108].

ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 7 Suspected Spine Trauma spine should also be maintained for patients with di sease processes known to cause spin e rigidity, such as diffuse 
idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis or ankylosing spondylitis. 
A comprehensive literature review of thoracolumbar trau ma was performed by Hsu et al [19] in 2003 with the 
conclusion that patients should undergo im aging of the thoracolumbar spine if  the following criteria were present: 
(1) back pain or midline tenderness, (2) local signs of thoracolumbar injury, (3) abnormal neurological signs, (4) 
cervical spine fracture, (5) Glasgow Coma  Scale score (GCS) <15, (6) major distracting injury, or (7) alcohol or 
drug intoxication. A prospective study by Holmes et al [20] of 152 patients with thoracolumbar spine injury in 2003 found 100% negative predictive value for thoracolumbar spine injury in patients not meeting any of the 
following criteria: (1) complaints of thoracolumbar spine pain, (2) thoracolumb ar spine tenderness, (3) a 
decreased level of consciousness, (4) intoxication with etha nol or drugs, (5) a neurologic deficit, or (6) a painful 
distracting injury. A prospective study of over 3,000 adult blunt trauma patients performed by Inaba et al [21] in 
2015 found 98.9% sensitivity for identifying patients with clin ically significant thoracolumbar spine injury using 
the following criteria: (1) positive physical examination (i ncluding neurologic deficit), (2) high-risk mechanism of 
injury, and (3) ≥60 years of age. It should be noted that in the study by Inaba et al, patients with altered 
consciousness (GCS <15), intoxication, or painful distrac ting injury were excluded from analysis because of their 
inability to perform an adequate examination necessitating imaging clear ance of the thoracolumbar spine. 
However, none of these 3 proposed criteria have  been validated independently (Table 4).

bone mass decreases slowly over time, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age, and differs by sex, race, 
ethnicity  [10], and comorbidities.

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
In the United  States,  acute low back  pain (LBP),  with or without radiculopathy , is the leading  cause of years lived  
with disability  and the third  ranking cause of disability -adjusted  life years  [1]. It is the fifth most  common  reason  
for a physician  visit in the United  States  and accounts for approximately  3% of visits  to the emergency  department  
[2]. 
The American  College  of Physicians and the American  Pain Society  classify  LBP into the following  broad  
categories:  nonspecific LBP, back  pain potentially  associated  with radiculopathy or spinal  stenosis,  and back  pain 
potentially  associated  with another  specific spinal  cause [3].

One study found no 
statistically  significant  difference in primary  outcome  after 1 year for patients  ≥65 years of age  who had spine  
imaging  within  6 weeks after an initial visit for care for LBP versus  similar  patients who did not undergo early  
imaging  [9]. Additionally,  patients  with new episodes of LBP and previous  MRI scans are unlikely  to detect  changes  
in disc protrusion,  annular  fissures,  high-intensity  zones,  or end-plate  signal  changes with repeated  MRI [13]. 
Bone  Scan  Whole  Body  with  SPECT  or SPECT/CT  Complete Spine  
There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of bone  scan with SPECT or SPECT/CT in the initial evaluation

A prospective  cohort  study of 20 patients  showed  no significant differences in MRI changes over 12 
months  in patients  presenting  with acute LBP compared  with their asymptomatic counterparts , except  in disc 
herniation,  nerve  root compression,  and annular  fissure [15]. Even  in the setting  of disc herniation,  imaging  may 
have  limited  role in management  as the majority  of disc herniations  show  some  degree of reabsorption  or regression  
by 8 weeks after symptom onset  [16]. It is important  to note that repeat  imaging  in patients  with new episodes of 
LBP and previous  MRI scans are unlikely  to detect  differences in disc protrusion,  annular  fissures,  high-intensity  
zones,  or end-plate  signal  changes [13]. 
Despite the lack of evidence to support  imaging early  or prior  to conservative treatment  for LBP, there is significant  
variation  in the ordering practices of physicians,  with nonadherance  to guidelines  leading  to increased  health  care 
utilization  [17,18] . A retrospective cohort  study of 145,320  patients ≥66 years of age  with acute nonspecific  LBP, 
revealed  27.2%  received  radiography  and 11.1%  received  CT or MRI within  4 weeks of the initial primary  care 
provider  visit [18]. A prospective  population-based  cohort  study  of 1,770 patients  with acute occupational  LBP 
showed  that 336 (19.0%)  received  lumbar  MRI within  6 weeks of presentation  (nonadherent  to guidelines).  This 
nonadherent  group had an increased  likelihood  of lumbosacral  injections  or surgery  for outpatient, inpatient, and 
nonmedical  services,  and disability  compensation  [17]. Increased  health  care utilization  with early  imaging  has also 
been  demonstrated  in nonworker  populations  [6].

Although the utility  of discography in patients  with LBP remains  controversial,  a systematic review by Manchikanti  
et al [32] provides  level  III evidence that lumbar  discography may be useful  in patients  with chronic  discogenic  
LBP.

There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of whole -body FDG-PET/CT in the evaluation  of a surgery  or 
intervention  candidate with persistent  or progressive  symptoms  during  or following 6 weeks of conservative  
management  [28-30]. 
MRI Lumbar Spine With IV Contrast  
MRI lumbar  spine  with IV contrast  is not typically  performed  independently as an initial study,  as its interpretation  
is most  informative  when  correlated  with standard  noncontrast  sequences included in MRI lumbar  spine  with and 
without  IV contrast  [33]. 
MRI Lumbar Spine Without and With IV Contrast  
MRI with IV contrast  is typically  not necessary  in the evaluation  of a surgical  or interventional candidate with 
persistent  or progressive  symptoms  during or following  6 weeks of conservative management  but is sometimes  
useful  if noncontrast  MRI is nondiagnostic  or indeterminate.  Contrast  can help distinguish  residual/recurrent  disc 
from  fibrosis/scar  in a postoperative  patient  (see Variant  5). 
MRI Lumbar Spine Without IV Contrast  
Patients  presenting  with subacute or chronic  LBP or radiculopathy  who have  failed  6 weeks of conservative therapy , 
and with physical  examination  signs  of nerve  root irritation , should  be imaged  if they are believed  to be candidates 
for surgery  or intervention  or if diagnostic  uncertainty  remains.  Accurate diagnosis  of disc disease can be provided  
by MRI [7].

Previous  guidelines  have  suggested  that imaging  be performed  in adults  >50 years of age who present  with LBP. 
When  studied,  there was no statistically  significant  difference in primary  outcome  after 1 year for patients  aged  65 
years or older  who had spine  imaging  within  6 weeks after an initial  visit for care for LBP versus similar  patients  
who did not undergo early  imaging  [9]; thus,  this document  does not include  >50 years of age as an independent  
red flag. However, an important age-related risk factor for spinal fracture presenting as LBP  is osteoporosis.  As 
bone mass decreases slowly over time, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age, and differs by sex, race, 
ethnicity  [10], and comorbidities.

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
In the United  States,  acute low back  pain (LBP),  with or without radiculopathy , is the leading  cause of years lived  
with disability  and the third  ranking cause of disability -adjusted  life years  [1]. It is the fifth most  common  reason  
for a physician  visit in the United  States  and accounts for approximately  3% of visits  to the emergency  department  
[2]. 
The American  College  of Physicians and the American  Pain Society  classify  LBP into the following  broad  
categories:  nonspecific LBP, back  pain potentially  associated  with radiculopathy or spinal  stenosis,  and back  pain 
potentially  associated  with another  specific spinal  cause [3].

Additionally,  guidelines  from  the American  College  
of Physicians and the American  Pain Society  [3,4]  emphasize a focused  history  and physical  examination,  
reassurance,  initial pain management  medications if necessary,  and consideration  of physical  therapies without  
routine  imaging  in patients  with nonspecific  LBP. Duration  of symptoms  also helps  guide  treatment  algorithms  in 
patients  with acute,  subacute,  or chronic  LBP. Additionally, assessment  of psychosocial  risk factors when  obtaining  
patient  history  is a strong predictor  of patients  who are predisposed  to developing chronic  disabling LBP problems  
[3]. 
Although there  is great  variability  in the definition  of acute and subacute  LBP, for the purposes  of this guideline,  
we will use the Institute  for Clinical Systems  Improvement  definitions  of 0 to 4 weeks to define  acute LBP,  4 to 12 
weeks for subacute LBP, and >12 weeks for chronic  LBP [5]. 
It is clear  that uncomplicated  acute  LBP and/or  radiculopathy is a benign,  self-limited  condition  that does not 
warrant  any imaging studies [4,6,7] . Imaging is considered  in those  patients who have  had up to 6 weeks of medical  
management  and physical  therapy  that resulted  in little or no improvement  in their back  pain.  It is also considered  
for those  patients  presenting  with red flags , raising  suspicion  for a serious underlying  condition,  such as cauda 
equina  syndrome  (CES),  malignancy,  fracture,  or infection  (see Table 1).

In line with the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations for patients  
ages 65 and older being screened for osteoporosis, patients  >65 years of age may be considered at risk for 
osteoporotic fracture when presenting with LBP . 
Additionally,  for those  patients without  neurologic  compromise  and who present  with minor  risk factors for cancer,  
inflammatory  back  disease  (eg, ankylosing spondylitis), vertebral  compression  fracture,  or symptomatic  spinal  
stenosis,  imaging  should be considered  after a trial of therapy  [4]. 
In the majority  of patients, no specific pathology for LBP can be identified. Also,  studies have  shown  imaging  
abnormalities  in a substantial  number  of people  without back  pain [11-13]. The challenge for the clinician, therefore,  
is to distin guish the small  segment  within  this large patient  population that should be evaluated  further because of 
suspicion  of a more  serious  problem  or identify  pathology that requires intervention . 
Other  nonspine  causes of LBP can have overlap  in clinical  presentation,  including inflammatory  arthritis  and other  
systemic conditions , such as pelvic,  renal,  vascular,  or gastrointestinal  etiologies.  If an inflammatory  etiology  is 
suspected  as the cause of LBP, such as ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic  spondylitis, reactive arthritis, or 
inflammatory  bowel  disease– related  spine  disorders,  please see the ACR  Appropriateness Criteria® topic  on 
“Inflammatory Back Pain: Known or Suspected Axial Spondyloarthropathy ” [14].

Initial imaging  is defined  as imaging  at the beginning of the care episode for the medical  condition defined  by the 
variant.

A prospective  cohort  study of 20 patients  showed  no significant differences in MRI changes over 12 
months  in patients  presenting  with acute LBP compared  with their asymptomatic counterparts , except  in disc 
herniation,  nerve  root compression,  and annular  fissure [15]. Even  in the setting  of disc herniation,  imaging  may 
have  limited  role in management  as the majority  of disc herniations  show  some  degree of reabsorption  or regression  
by 8 weeks after symptom onset  [16]. It is important  to note that repeat  imaging  in patients  with new episodes of 
LBP and previous  MRI scans are unlikely  to detect  differences in disc protrusion,  annular  fissures,  high-intensity  
zones,  or end-plate  signal  changes [13]. 
Despite the lack of evidence to support  imaging early  or prior  to conservative treatment  for LBP, there is significant  
variation  in the ordering practices of physicians,  with nonadherance  to guidelines  leading  to increased  health  care 
utilization  [17,18] . A retrospective cohort  study of 145,320  patients ≥66 years of age  with acute nonspecific  LBP, 
revealed  27.2%  received  radiography  and 11.1%  received  CT or MRI within  4 weeks of the initial primary  care 
provider  visit [18]. A prospective  population-based  cohort  study  of 1,770 patients  with acute occupational  LBP 
showed  that 336 (19.0%)  received  lumbar  MRI within  6 weeks of presentation  (nonadherent  to guidelines).  This 
nonadherent  group had an increased  likelihood  of lumbosacral  injections  or surgery  for outpatient, inpatient, and 
nonmedical  services,  and disability  compensation  [17]. Increased  health  care utilization  with early  imaging  has also 
been  demonstrated  in nonworker  populations  [6].

CES is rare and results from  dysfunction of the sacral  and lumbar  nerve  roots  within  the vertebral  canal  secondary  
to cauda equina  nerve  root compression , producing impairment  of the bladder,  bowel,  or sexual  function and 
perianal  or saddle numbness.  Back  pain with or without  radicular  symptoms,  weakness in the lower  limbs, sensory  
changes or numbness  in the lower  limbs,  or absent  lower  limb reflexes are other  symptoms  that have  been  described  
[38]. A review of physical  examination  findings  reported  by Fairbanks  et al [39] found LBP as the most  common  
physical  finding in patients  with the diagnosis  of CES.  The most  common  cause of CES is lumbar  disc herniation  
at the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels.  Other  etiologies  include  neoplasm,  infection/inflammation, spinal  stenosis,  and 
hemorrhage.  
Multifocal deficits  and progressive neurologic  deficits can be caused  by a number  of other  noncompressive  
etiologies  with some  overlapping clinical  features.  Please see the ACR Appropriateness Criteria® topic on 
“Myelopathy ” for guidance  [40]. 
The imaging  study of choice in the evaluation  of suspected  CES, multifocal deficit, or progres sive neurologic  deficit

Demyelinating  diseases such as MS can present  as subacute/chronic myelopathy.  MS is the classic  demyelinating  
disease and is characterized  by lesions affecting  the spinal  cord (and brain)  and clinical  defects disseminated  in

can present  as chronic  myelopathy less commonly.  In patients  with chronic  or progressive myelopathy,  MRI  of the 
spinal  cord can identify  spinal  cord lesions suggestive  of demyelinating  disease in addition  to excluding  alternative  
etiologie s. Contrast -enhanced  imaging  is recommended  for initial diagnostic  evaluation  [69,70] . 
Metabolic  causes of chronic  or progressive  myelopathy result  in changes in the spinal  cord known  as subacute 
combined degeneration  and are best evaluated  with MRI [11,83,84] . Chronic  infections  can have  a similar  
appearance [12].  
Radiation -induced  myelopathy is a rare dose-dependent  complication  that anatomically  localizes to a prior  radiation  
port [85]. Autoimmune  myelitis  includes  paraneoplastic myelopathy [86,87] . MRI  without  and with IV contrast  is 
useful  to evaluate the spinal  cord in these instances.  
Vascular  malformations  can likewise present  with chronic  and slowly  progressive  myelopathy [88]. MRI without  
and with IV contrast  is useful  to demonstrate spinal  cord edema  caused  by venous  hypertension and enlarged  veins  
along the dorsal  surface of the spinal  cord.  There may be patchy  intramedullary  enhancement  due to breakdown  of 
the blood-cord  barrier.  In some  cases,  abnormal  vasculature may be identified  that may be useful  to guide  spinal  
arteriography  and intervention [5,89-91] .

efficiency  and emergency  department  throughput  [42]. 
Although MRI  lumbar  spine  without  IV contrast  is the preferred  initial study,  MRI lumbar  spine  without  and with 
IV contrast  may be helpful  to delineate etiology  of CES when  underlying malignancy,  infection, or inflammation  
is clinically suspected (see  Variant  7). 
Although  MRI  is superior  in soft-tissue contrast  and characterizing  the etiology  of CES, CT lumbar  spine  without  
IV contrast  can answer  the question of whether  or not cauda equina  compression  is present.  A recent  retrospective  
review of 151 patients  with clinically  suspected  CES showed  that ≥50%  thecal  sac effacement  on CT predicted  
significant  spinal  stenosis,  and <50%  thecal  sac effacement  reliably  excluded  cauda equina  impingement,  using

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
In the United  States,  acute low back  pain (LBP),  with or without radiculopathy , is the leading  cause of years lived  
with disability  and the third  ranking cause of disability -adjusted  life years  [1]. It is the fifth most  common  reason  
for a physician  visit in the United  States  and accounts for approximately  3% of visits  to the emergency  department  
[2]. 
The American  College  of Physicians and the American  Pain Society  classify  LBP into the following  broad  
categories:  nonspecific LBP, back  pain potentially  associated  with radiculopathy or spinal  stenosis,  and back  pain 
potentially  associated  with another  specific spinal  cause [3].

ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 6 Low Back  Pain Table  1. Red Flags : Indications  of a more  complicated  status  include  back  pain/radiculopathy  in the following  
settings  (adapted  from  Bigos et al  [8]). 
Red Flag  Potential  Underlying  Condition  as Cause  of LBP  
• History  of cancer  
• Unexplained  weight  loss 
• Immunosuppression 
• Urinary  infection  
• Intravenous  drug use 
• Prolonged  use of corticosteroids 
• Back  pain not improved with conservative  
management  • Cancer  or infection  
• History  of significant  trauma  
• Minor  fall or heavy  lift in a potentially  osteoporotic  
or elderly  individual  
• Prolonged  use of steroids  • Spinal fracture  
• Acute  onset  of urinary  retention  or overflow  
incontinence  
• Loss of anal sphincter  tone or fecal  incontinence  
• Saddle  anesthesia  
• Bilateral  or progressive  weakness in the lower  
limbs  • Cauda  equina  syndrome  or other  severe neurologic  
condition  
Previous  guidelines  have  suggested  that imaging  be performed  in adults  >50 years of age who present  with LBP. 
When  studied,  there was no statistically  significant  difference in primary  outcome  after 1 year for patients  aged  65 
years or older  who had spine  imaging  within  6 weeks after an initial  visit for care for LBP versus similar  patients  
who did not undergo early  imaging  [9]; thus,  this document  does not include  >50 years of age as an independent  
red flag. However, an important age-related risk factor for spinal fracture presenting as LBP  is osteoporosis.  As 
bone mass decreases slowly over time, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age, and differs by sex, race, 
ethnicity  [10], and comorbidities.

Additionally,  guidelines  from  the American  College  
of Physicians and the American  Pain Society  [3,4]  emphasize a focused  history  and physical  examination,  
reassurance,  initial pain management  medications if necessary,  and consideration  of physical  therapies without  
routine  imaging  in patients  with nonspecific  LBP. Duration  of symptoms  also helps  guide  treatment  algorithms  in 
patients  with acute,  subacute,  or chronic  LBP. Additionally, assessment  of psychosocial  risk factors when  obtaining  
patient  history  is a strong predictor  of patients  who are predisposed  to developing chronic  disabling LBP problems  
[3]. 
Although there  is great  variability  in the definition  of acute and subacute  LBP, for the purposes  of this guideline,  
we will use the Institute  for Clinical Systems  Improvement  definitions  of 0 to 4 weeks to define  acute LBP,  4 to 12 
weeks for subacute LBP, and >12 weeks for chronic  LBP [5]. 
It is clear  that uncomplicated  acute  LBP and/or  radiculopathy is a benign,  self-limited  condition  that does not 
warrant  any imaging studies [4,6,7] . Imaging is considered  in those  patients who have  had up to 6 weeks of medical  
management  and physical  therapy  that resulted  in little or no improvement  in their back  pain.  It is also considered  
for those  patients  presenting  with red flags , raising  suspicion  for a serious underlying  condition,  such as cauda 
equina  syndrome  (CES),  malignancy,  fracture,  or infection  (see Table 1).

Accurate diagnosis  of disc disease can be provided  
by MRI [7]. 
Although disc abnormalities are common on MRI in asymptomatic  patients,  LBP with radiculopathy or clinical  
signs  of spinal  stenosis suggests the presence of demonstrable  nerve  root compression  on MRI  [13]. In a study of 
symptomatic  patients,  there  was a higher  prevalence  of herniation . Fifty -seven  percent  of patients with LBP  and 
65% of patients  with radiculopathy  had disc herniation  as compared  with the 20% to 28% prevalence reported  in 
the asymptomatic series [7]. Interestingly, the size and type of disc herniation  and location  and presence of nerve  
root compression  were not related  to patient  outcome  [7,34] . 
Kobayashi  et al [35] have  shown  the utility  of MRI in diagnosing active spondylolysis  in radiographically occult  
spondylolysis.  
Radiography Lumbar  Spine  
Although  radiography  alone  is not sufficient  for guidance  on surgical  or interventional  options  without  MRI  and/or  
CT imaging,  it can be seen as compl ementary.  Upright  radiographs  provide  useful  functional  information  about  
axial  loading  [36]. The ability  to incorporate  flexion  and extension  radiographs  is essential  to identify  segmental  
motion,  which  is important in the surgical  management  of spondylolisthesis  [24,37] . Lateral  bending images have  
been  shown  to be helpful  in spinal  deformity  correction  surgery  [25].

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
The physical,  psychological , and socioeconomic  impact  of cervical  or neck  pain is extensive.  In 2010,  16.3 
million  health  care visits  to hospitals  and physician  offices were related  primarily  to neck  pain [1]. The Global  
Burden  of Disease 2010 Study  identified  neck  pain as the fourth  leading  cause of years lost to disability [2], with 
most  epidemiological  studies reporting an annual  prevalence ranging between  15% and 50% [3-8]. Although  most  
episodes resolve,  nearly  50% of individuals  continue  to experience ongoing or recurrent  pain [9].

Radiculopathies  may result  from  compressive causes  related to narrowing of the neural foramina, such as by facet 
or uncovertebral joint hypertrophy, or from associated dis c bulging or herniation  and degenerative spondylosis  in 
the absence of a history  of diabetes or red flag symptom s [31].  A recent meta-analysis assessing the positive 
predictive value of physical examination tests in the setting of a clinical history of cervical radiculopathy 
concluded there was limited evidence for a correlation between physical examination findings and MRI evidence 
of cervical nerve root compression [32].  This may be due to a high rate of both false -positive and false-negative 
findings on MRI in the setting of suspected cervical radiculopathy [33 ]. Most cases of acute cervical neck pain 
with radicular symptoms resolve spontaneously or with conse rvative treatment measures [31, 34]. 
In absence of red flag symptoms, imaging may not be required at time of initial presentation [1 ] as spondylotic 
changes are commonly identified on radi ographs and MRI in patients >30 years of age and correlate poorly with 
the presence of neck pain [20-23]. Although the diagnostic accuracy of red flag symptoms is not validated for the 
cervical spine, the Bone  and Joint  Decade 2000 -2010 Task Force on Neck Pain and Its Associated Disorders [1] 
recommended the adoption of a similar system for cervical and neck pain, with red flags that include  trauma, 
malignancy, prior neck surgery, spinal cord injury, systemic diseases —inclu ding ankylosing spondylitis, diffuse 
idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, inflammatory arthritis, suspected infection —history of intravenous drug use, 
intractable pain despite therapy, or tenderness to palpation over a vertebral body. Additional proposed red flags include congenital findings, concomitant vascular disease in patients >50 years of age, abnormal labs (erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate, C -reactive protein level, white blood cell), and neurological deficits [10
].

Both traumatic and degenerative lesions of the TFCC can produce chronic, ulnar -sided wrist pain . MRI is highly 
accurate for lesions involving the radial (central) zone of the disc, especially with the use of high -resolution fast 
spin-echo or 3-D grad ient-recalled pulse sequences [36]. There is some evidence suggesting that MRI performed 
with a 3.0 T system is even more accurate than MRI performed with a 1.5 T system for TFCC lesions [37], but 
there are no studies comparing the accuracy of the two field s trengths in the same patients. The sensitivity for 
tears of the ulnar attachment of the disc and the peripheral attachments (the ulnocarpal ligaments) are only fair 
with noncontrast -enhanced wrist MRI [ 12,36]. IV contrast seldom provides added benefit in patients with ulnar -
sided wrist pain but may increase sensitivity for TFCC lesions if MR arthrography is desired but direct joint 
injection is not feasible.

No literature directly addresses the appropriateness of imaging studies beyond radiographs in patients with 
suspected infection in the wrist. However, generalizing from experience with septic arthrit is in other joints, joint 
aspiration should not be delayed in order to obtain advanced imaging studies. In cases of suspected septic arthritis, 
percutaneous aspiration of the wrist is indicated, even when radiographs appear normal. Aspirates should be 
analyzed by cell count, gram stain, and appropriate cultures. Microscopic crystal analysis should also be obtained 
if there is a possibility of gout, acute pseudogout, or hydroxyapatite deposition disease. Aspiration can be 
performed without imaging guidance i f the joint is distended, but either fluoroscopy or US  may be useful if a 
specific compartment is to be targeted.  
MRI Wrist  
There may be a role for MRI with IV contrast enhancement in the staging of infections (for example, to delineate the location and extent of soft-tissue abscesses)  after aspiration has been performed.  Especially in chronic cases, 
MRI with IV contrast may be useful to identify a fluid collection or joint effusion to target  for aspiration.  
However, MRI is usually not appropriate as the next study after radiographs for suspected wrist infections.

better quantified following MRI with IV contrast administration, possibly  if performed dynamically, allowing 
confident early diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment guidance in these patients  [27,28]. Additionally, 
inflammatory tenosynovitis may be more conspicuous after IV  contrast administration [29]. As is the case for any

ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 10 Chronic Wrist Pain  importantly, though, the finding of enhancing bone marrow “edema” (osteitis) on MRI studies in patients with 
early RA is proving to be the best single predictor of future disease progression and functional dete rioration, even 
compared to serologies and clinical measures [27, 28,32-34].  
US Wrist  
The diagnosis of a specific inflammatory arthritis is typically established based on clinical and laboratory 
analysis. Advanced imaging is usually performed to determine disease activity, guide management decisions, and prognosticate outcomes. In patients with RA, US  of the wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints can  show 
inflammation  as active synovitis. Identifying active synovitis with power Doppler assessment is a useful adjunct 
in making an early diagnosis of RA when a pati ent with early arthritis does not meet the 2010 criteria established 
by the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism [20]. The presence of 
synovitis predicts progression of erosions [31 ] and erosions themselves [35]. US can also depict small bone 
erosions with high spatial resolution; h owever, US is less sensitive to erosions that occur on the radial or ulnar 
sides of the inner carpal bones because direct scanning of these regions is blocked, unlike the dorsal and volar 
bone surfaces. Furthermore, unlike MRI, US cannot show changes within the bone marrow, which are  the 
strongest prognosticator s for disease progression in RA [27, 28,32-34].  In patients with established inflammatory 
arthritis who are undergoing therapy, judging progression or reduction of synovitis may be more difficult with 
sequential US compared to sequential MRI.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
MR arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected inflammatory 
arthritides. 
CT Wrist  
While CT is more sensitive than radiographs for erosions, CT is not routinely used for the diagnosis and

Radiographs  
While there is no recent literature that directly addresses the role of first-line examinations for chronic wrist pain, 
radiographs are usually  appropriate as an initial study. Radiographs are widely available , and for many bone, 
joint, and alignment abnormalities, radiographs alone are diagnostic. In other patients, nonspecific radiologic findings (including those in the soft  tissues) combined with the history and physical examination may be 
sufficient for clinical diagnosis, or may suggest preferred secondary imaging studies.

MRI with dynamic  contrast  enhancement  has been  shown  to be useful  to differentiate  osteonecrosis from  transient

CT Knee  
CT is not routinely  used as the initial imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the knee  but is superior  to 
knee  radiographs  in detection  and classification  of fractures [12].

It is general  
agreement  that radiographs  should be obtained  and the clinical  decision  rule should not be applied  for patients with

found  no statistically  significant  difference between  MRI and contrast -enhanced  CT imaging  in determining  tumor  
involvement  of muscle,  bone,  joint, or neurovascular  structures.  Therefore,  CT with IV contrast  remains an 
important  adjunct  in the evaluation  of a soft tissue mass.  
The advent  of virtual noncontrast  reconstruction  with modern dual-source CT scanners allows  for acquisition  of a 
single  postcontrast  scan with reconstruction  of virtual noncontrast  images,  which  can preclude  the need  for a 
separate precontrast  scan phase [31]. Similar  to CT without  IV contrast  [21, 22], virtual noncontrast  imaging  allows 
distinction  of ossification  from  calcification  and identification  of characteristic patterns of mineralization  [29,30]  
and is particularly  useful  in assessment  of mass  mineralization  in areas where the osseous anatomy is complex  or 
obscured  and radiographs  would be less sensitive.

ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 17 Low Back  Pain CT Lumbar Spine Without IV Contrast  
CT lumbar  spine without  IV contrast  can be performed  to evaluate  osseous integrity  (eg, pathologic  fracture)  when  
involved with tumor.  However,  intradural  and spinal  cord pathologies  are poorly depicted  on CT, so MRI without  
and with IV contrast  is preferred . Addition of IV contrast may be useful  to assess for epidural  abscess  in patients  
for this clinical  scenario  and for patients  with suspected  infection . [45-47]. 
CT Myelography Lumbar  Spine  
CT myelography of the lumbar  spine  assesses  the patency  of the spinal  canal/thecal  sac and of the subarticular  
recesses and neural  foramen  [22]. It can be useful  in patients  with suspected  neoplasm  and neurologic  deficit.  This 
modality  has the disadvantage  of lumbar  puncture  and injection  of intrathecal  contrast  [22]. 
Discography  and Post-Discography  CT Lumbar  Spine  
There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of discography  and post-discography  CT lumbar  spine  in this 
clinical  scenario.  
FDG -PET/CT  Whole  Body  
Whole -body FDG-PET/CT is typically  not an initial imaging  study  but can be used to evaluate for widespread  
metastatic  disease and can distinguish  benign versus malignant  compression  fractures  [65,66] . 
MRI Lumbar Spine With IV Contrast  
MRI lumbar  spine  with IV contrast  is not typically  performed  independently as an initial study,  as its interpretation  
is most  informative  when  correlated  with standard  noncontrast  sequences included in MRI lumbar  spine  with and

ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 15 Low Back  Pain MRI lumbar  spine  without  IV contrast  is useful  in determining  the acuity  of a vertebral  fracture,  as evidenced  by 
bone  marrow  edema and in demonstrating spinal  canal  compromise,  for example from  displaced  or retropulsed  
fractures.  For imaging  evaluation  and management  of vertebral  compression  fractures,  please see the ACR 
Appropriateness Criteria® topic on “ Management of Vertebral  Compression  Fractures ” for guidance [57]. 
Additionally,  the distinction  between  malignant  and benign  compression  fractures  can be assessed  on MRI.  The 
visualization  of the convex posterior  vertebral  body  border,  extension into the posterior  elements,  and abnormal  
marrow  signal  are suggestive  of pathologic  fracture  [58]. 
CT myelography of the lumbar  spine  assess the patency  of the spinal  canal/thecal  sac and of the subarticular  recesses

has the disadvantage  of lumbar  puncture  and injection  of intrathecal  contrast  [22]. 
Bone  scan with SPECT/CT is usually  not used for initial imaging  but can be useful  for radiographically occult  
fractures and can be used to evaluate acuity  of vertebral  fracture . [59]. 
Whole -body FDG-PET/CT is typically  not an initial imaging study,  but as a follow -up study , it can help distinguish

CT Lumbar Spine Without IV Contrast  
CT lumbar  spine without  IV contrast  may be useful  for preoperative  planning [26]. CT delineates osseous  margins  
and aids in trajectory  planning  for hardware fixation . Additionally,  CT lumbar  spine  without  IV contrast  can be 
used to assess facets and neural  foramina  in patients  who cannot  undergo MRI and is equal  to MRI for predicting  
significant  spinal  stenosis and excluding cauda equina  impingement  [27]. 
CT Myelography Lumbar  Spine  
CT myelography of the lumbar  spine  can be useful  in assessing  the patency  of the spinal  canal/thecal  sac and of the 
subarticular  recesses and neural  foramen  [22]. It has safety  advantages over MRI  for patients  who have  implanted  
medical  devices that are not MRI safe or conditional  and can be useful  in patients  with significant  artifact  from

MRI Lumbar Spine Without and With IV Contrast  
MRI lumbar  spine  without  and with IV contrast  is useful  for this group.  For malignant/metastatic  disease,  MRI is 
preferred  as both bony/marrow  involvement  and neural  compression  from  epidural  tumor  are visualized  with high 
spatial  resolution  [62]. In a patient  with suspected  spinal  infection, MRI without  and with IV contrast  is preferred  
because of its  high sensitivity  and specificity. MRI can localize  the site of infection  and assess the extent  of 
extradural/epidural  and paravertebral  involvement  [65,67] , and is helpful  to distinguish  abscess from  phlegmon 
[67]. 
MRI Lumbar Spine Without IV Contrast  
MRI lumbar  spine  without  IV can be a sufficient  imaging  study  if there is low risk of epidural  and/or  intraspinal  
disease.  It is highly  sensitive for bone  marrow  abnormalities , and with a combination of noncontrast  T1-weighted  
and short tau inversion recovery sequences it can distinguish whether  they are benign or malignant  [62]. 
Radiography Lumbar  Spine  
Sensitivity  of radiography is markedly  limited  for metastases [64]. MRI is preferred  to radiography because of its  
higher  sensitivity  and specificity  for osseous lesions and for its ability  to assess soft-tissue abnormalities  [69,70] . 
Summary  of Recommendations 
• Variant 1:  Imagi ng is usually not appropriate for  the initial imaging of patients with acute LBP with or without 
radiculopathy, no red flags , and no prior management.  
• Variant 2:  Imagi ng is usually not appropriate for  the initial imaging of patients with subacute or chronic LBP 
with or without radiculopathy, no red flags , and no prior management.

Noncontrast  and contrast -enhanced  MRI  
has the ability  to demonstrate inflammatory, neoplastic,  and most  traumatic  lesions , as well as to show  anatomic  
detail  not available on isotope  studies [68]. 
Although less sensitive and specific than MRI for evaluation  for infection  or neoplasm,  CT lumbar  spine  without  
IV contrast  can be obtained to evaluate for associated  osseous abnormalities  (eg, pathologic  fracture,  bony  
destructive change).  In some  cases,  addition  of IV contrast may be useful  to assess for epidural  abscess  in such 
patients  [45-47]. 
CT myelography of the lumbar  spine  assesses  the patency  of the spinal  canal/thecal  sac and of the subarticular  
recesses and neural  foramen  [22]. It can be useful  in patients  with suspected  neoplasm  and neurologic  deficit.  This 
modality  has the disadvantage  of lumbar  puncture  and injection  of intrathecal  contrast  [22]. 
Bone  Scan  Whole  Body  with  SPECT  or SPECT/CT  Complete Spine  
SPECT or SPECT/CT is not the initial imaging  study but can be used to evaluate for widespread  osseous metastatic  
disease.  
CT Lumbar Spine With IV Contrast  
CT lumbar  spine  with IV contrast  can be performed  to evaluate osseous integrity  (eg, pathologic  fracture)  when  
involved with tumor.  However,  intradural  and spinal  cord pathologies  are poorly depicted  on CT, so MRI without

Bone  scan with SPECT/CT is usually  not used for initial imaging  but can be useful  for radiographically occult

CT Lumbar Spine With IV Contrast  
CT with IV  contrast  does not provide  additional information to CT lumbar  spine  without  IV contrast  for evaluation

CT Lumbar Spine Without IV Contrast  
CT provides  a detailed  analysis of fractures extending to the posterior  column of the vertebra or for evaluating  the

ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 11 Shoulder Pain –Traumatic  Variant 5: Traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs show Bankart  or Hill-Sachs lesion. Next imaging  study. 
Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions are common findings associated with transient shoulder dislocation. Bankart 
lesions have a particularly high association with transient shoulder dislocations [50], and a transient shoulder 
dislocation should be presumed if a Bankart lesion is present. A close association exists bet ween Bankart and 
Hill-Sachs lesions [ 51], and one should be sought out whenever the other is identified on radiographs. Both 
Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions can present as nonosseous  lesions that are occult on r adiographs and noncontrast 
CT. 
MRI Shoulder  
Similar to MR arthrography, noncontrast MRI is comparable to CT in evaluating glenoid and humeral head bone 
loss [12,18]. In general, noncontrast MRI performs well in diagnosing labroligamentous injuries [ 20,52]. 
However, noncontrast MRI is considered inferior to MR arthrography for assessing labroligamentous pathology 
frequently associated with Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions [ 17,19]. Noncontrast MRI is a good alternative to MR 
arthrography in the setting of acute injury when significant glenohumeral joint effusion is present to assist in 
visualization of intra -articular soft -tissue pathology.  
MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography is the preferred study for evaluating subacute or chronic Bankart lesions because of  its soft -
tissue contrast. Multiple studies have shown MR arthrography to be reliable in diagnosing labroligamentous 
injuries [12,17,52] and superior to noncontrast MRI for this indication [ 17,19].

Radiography Shoulder  
Most  literature  suggests that radiographs  should be the initial imaging  study  in patients  with shoulder  pain [1,10] . 
Standard  radiographic  exam ination  consists of a combination  of different  projections  typically  including  
anteroposterior  (AP) internal  rotation,  AP external  rotation,  Grashey  (oblique  AP in the plane  of the glenohumeral  
joint), scapular  “Y,” and axillary  views [10]. Radiographs  can evaluate for unexpected  fracture,  unsuspected  
aggressive bony lesion,  osteoarthritis, inflammatory  arthropathy,  osteonecrosis,  or calcium  hydroxyapatite  
deposition.  Accurate  interpretation  of radiographs  can often  obviate  additional  imaging  or be complementary  to 
subsequent  imaging studie s. A high-riding  humeral  head  on radiographs  is highly associated  with chronic  rotator  
cuff tear [11], particularly  if seen in combination with sclerosis of the inferior acromion,  greater  tuberosity  cysts,  a 
lateral  acromial  spur, and cortical  irregularity  or sclerosis of the greater  tuberosity  [12-14].

MR arthrography has been shown 
to be equivalent to CT in the assess ment of glenoid and humeral head bone loss [ 12,18], while being superior to 
CT in assessment of labroligamentous in juries [12]. MR arthrography is also able to delineate humeral head and 
glenoid cartilage, which can be important because some Hill -Sachs lesions affect  cartilage only  [11]. 
CT Shoulder  
Noncontrast CT has historically been used to assess Hill -Sachs and bony Bankart lesions. However, MRI has 
been shown to be equivalent to CT for a ssessing both glenoid and humeral head bone loss [ 12,18,53], and CT is 
limited in the assessment of cartilaginous Hill -Sachs lesions [11]. In addition, CT cannot assess injury to 
soft-tissue structures like the labroligamentous complex, which further limits its usefulness in evaluating Bankart 
lesions. CT should be reserved for patients with a contraindication to MRI or patients in whom MRI assessment 
of bone loss is limited.  
CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
CT arthrography has sho wn fair agreement between observers and is comparable to MR arthrography in 
diagnosing Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions [ 12,13]. However, CT arthrography is inferior to MRI in diagnosing 
other soft -tissue pathology [ 12]. CT arthrography can be considered a reasonable imaging alterna tive in patients 
with contraindication to MRI. 
US Shoulder  
There is no role for US  in assessment of Bankart or Hill -Sachs lesions. US  has been demonstrated to be inferior to 
MRI in diagnosing both labroligamentous injury and Hill -Sachs lesions [ 17].

ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 12 Shoulder Pain –Traumatic  MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography is the preferred exam ination  for the evaluation of subacute shoulder dislocations or recurrent 
shoulder instability. MRI has been shown to have similar performance to CT in the evaluation of Hill-Sachs 
lesions and glenoid bone loss [12,18]. MR arthrography has also been found to be reliable in diagnosi ng anterior 
shoulder instability and labroligamentous injuries [58,59]. MR arthrography has specifically o utperformed 
noncontrast MRI in assessment of glenohumeral ligament and anterior labral injuries [ 17,19], which ar e 
commonly seen in shoulder instability. MR arthrogr aphy has also outperformed noncontrast MRI in diagnosis of 
rotator cuff tears [17,19], which is a common associated finding in older patients with shoulder dislocation. 
However, high sensitivities reported for MR arthrography in the detection of labral pathology may not be 
applicable to patients with clinically unstable shoulders. A retrospective review of 90 patients with clinically 
unstable shoulders selected for arthroscopy [ 60] found that MR arthrography had a sensitivity of 65% for 
detection of labral  tears. The authors proposed that this discrepancy with prior studies was the result of different 
patient selection criteria (clinically unstable in their study versus less-specific symptoms such as shoulder pain in 
others) and the interpretation of MR art hrography by experienced musculoskeletal radiologists [ 60]. For this 
document, it is assumed the procedure is performed and interpreted by an expert.  
MRI Shoulder  
MRI without contrast may be pre ferred to MR arthrography in the setting of acute shoulder dislocation when a 
post-traumatic joint effusion is present to provide sufficient visualization of soft -tissue structures. In the subacute 
or chronic setting, the glenohumeral joint effusion is usually too small to provide adequate joint distention for 
optimal assessment  of soft -tissue structures.

Shoulder dislocation or instability is most co mmon in the anterior direction. Younger patients are more likely to 
have labroligamentous injury and persistent instability after dislocation compared with older patients [54]. Older 
patients are more likely to have rotator cuff tears in association with shoulder dislocation [ 55]. Coexisting 
humeral avulsion of the glenohumeral ligament and significant glenoid bone loss have been found in up to 10% of 
patients with recurrent shoulder instability [ 56], which underscores the need to assess both osseous and 
labroligamentous pathology in patients with shoulder dislocation or instability. Glenoid morphology and bone 
loss can play a significant factor in recurrent shoulder dislocations [15, 16,57], which may require bone grafting in 
order to restore stability [ 57].

CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
CT arthrogram , althou gh not the initial study of choice, has the advantage of characterizing both bony lesions and 
significant soft -tissue injuries. CT arthrograms have been shown to be comparable to magnetic resonance ( MR) 
arthrography in diagnosing Bankart, Hill -Sachs, super ior labral anterior -to-posterior ( SLAP), and full-thickness 
rotator cuff tears, but inferior to MR arthrography for diagnosing partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [ 12], 
including bursal -sided tears. CT arthrography has also only demonstrated modest agreement between observers in 
diagnosing anterior capsular laxity of the shoulder [ 13]. 
MRI Shoulder  
Noncontrast MR imaging ( MRI) has been shown to be effective in assessing bony morphology and bone loss in 
patients with tr aumatic shoulder injuries [ 14-18 ], and noncontrast MRI is effective in diagnosing most traumatic 
soft-tissue pathologies including labral, rotator cuff, and glenohumeral ligament injuries [ 17,19,20]. 
MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography is considered the gold standard for imaging traumatic shoulder pain [4,17,19,21]. MR

labroligamentous injuries, and partial rotator cuff tears [17,19]. MR arthrography is comparable to CT in

CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
CT arthrography provides comparable sensitivity and possibly improved specificity in detection of labral lesions 
compared to MR arthrography  [12,67] and can provide improved visualization of the bones in cases of complex 
trauma. However, interobserver variability in reporting of labral lesions is low [13]. CT arthrography has also 
been shown to be inferior to MR arthrography in assessing partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [12], which makes 
CT arthrography less desirable in patients where rotator cuff tears may be suspected. However, CT arthrography 
may be considered in a patient with shoulder dislocation/instabili ty and contraindication to MRI.

MRI is ideal for evaluating tendon injuries and helping with surgical planning [58, 59]. MRI is comm only used for 
the diagnosis of  Stener lesions of the thumb [60] and the diagnosis of pulley system injuries [61]. 
Hergan et al [62] reported a 100% sensitivity and specificity for assessment of thumb ulnar collateral ligament 
tears. Spaeth et al [ 63] reported a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 94% for detection of displaced ulnar 
collateral ligament tears in 16 cadaveric specimens.  
US Hand  
A Stener lesion occurs when the aponeurosis of the adductor pollicis muscle becomes interposed between the 
ruptured ulnar collateral ligament of the thumb and its site  of insertion at the base of the proximal phalanx. This 
lesion can be identified by absence of ulnar collateral ligament and the presence of a hypoechoic mass proximal to 
the apex of the metacarpal tubercle [64]. Dynamic examination shows the relationship of the aponeurosis to the 
retracted ligament stump [65] . 
US allows for diagnosis of pulley system injuries [ 66,67].

ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 6 Acute Hand and Wrist Trauma  Like CT, MRI shows intra -articular extension of distal radius fractures more frequently than radiography.  Unlike 
CT, MRI shows concomitant ligament  injuries, including tears of the scapholunate ligament, which may affect 
surgical treatment [26,27]. Despite these advantages,  MRI performed immediately at the time of injury has little 
added value for determining which patients go on to surgery [ 23]. 
MRI is especially useful in evaluating  hand soft -tissues injuries, including the collateral ligaments, volar plates, 
tendons, and pulleys. For metacarpal and digital fractures, MRI is usually not indicated during acute injury [ 22]. 
There is no evidence to support the use of MRI with IV contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist trauma.

The accuracy of MRI for extrinsic ligament assessment is unknown [ 37]. 
Extensor carpi ulnaris tendinopathy, tenosynovitis, and tendon rupture can be evaluated with MRI or US [43]. 
However, dynamic instability may be missed on MRI, unless sequences are performed in pronation and 
supination [44]. 
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
At 1.5T, MR arthrography has greater sensitivity compared with conventional MRI [ 45,46]. Both MRI and MR 
arthrography have poor to moderate sensitivity for partial ligament tears [ 47,48]. When only complete tears are 
considered, MRI and MR arthrography may be equivalent [ 33]. 
The accuracy of  MR arthrography for extrinsic ligament assessment is unknown [ 37]. 
US Wrist  
High -frequency US is useful for visualizing wrist tendons as well as intrinsic and extrinsic carpal ligaments 
[44,49,50]. Dynamic “clenched fist” maneuvers may be performed to improve detection of low -grade injuries 
[51]. 
For tears of the dorsal band of the scapholunate ligament, US  sensitivity varies from 46 % to 100% and specificity 
from 92 % to 100% [50-52 ]. For the dorsal band of the lunotriquetral ligament, US  sensitivity ranges from 25 % to

sensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs 
in the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral 
and oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar 
coalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs 
on the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have 
been found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable 
methods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  
Radiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review 
by Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for

• Variant 5:  MRI foot without IV contrast or CT foot without IV contr ast is usually appropriate as the next 
imaging study after negative or equivocal radiographs in patients with n onradiating chronic midfoot pain of 
suspected osseous origin when clinical concern includes occult fracture or painful accessory ossicles.  
• Varian t 6: MRI foot without IV contrast or US foot is usually appropriate as the next imaging study after 
negative or equivocal radiographs in patients with chronic foot pain resulting from e ntrapment syndromes  when 
clinical concern includes Baxter’s neuropathy.

MRI Foot  
MRI is not routinely  used as the first imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the foot in the setting  of 
peripheral  neuropathy,  penetrating  trauma , or polytrauma . 
US Foot  
US is not routinely  used as the first imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the foot in the setting  of 
peripheral  neuropathy or polytrauma.  Both  radiographs  and US are useful  imaging  tools  to exclude  a foreign  body  
in the setting  of penetrating  trauma  to the foot [24]. US is the imaging  modality  of choice if the foreign  body is 
not radiopaque  (eg, wood  or plastic) , with a reported  90% sensitivity  for visualizing  wooden  foreign  bodies  in 
some  clinical  and experimental  studies [27,28] . US can identify  a foreign  body  and also help localize  it and 
determine if it involves  a tendon  or a muscle and to evaluate for an abscess.  
Variant  4: Adult  or child older  than  5 years of age. Acute trauma to the foot.  Ottawa  rules can be evaluated  
without  exclusionary  criteria.  Ottawa  rules are negative.  Suspected  pathology  in an anatomic  area  not 
addressed  by Ottawa  rules (not involving  the midfoot; eg, metatarsal -phalangeal  joint,  metatarsal,  toe, 
tendon, etc). Initial imaging.  
In clinical  situations  when  Ottawa rules  are applicable and negative , imaging may still be desired  to evaluate for 
injuries  not assessed  by the Ottawa rules.  For example,  clinical scenarios of acute foot trauma  not directly  
addressed  by the Ottawa rules include  trauma  to the metatarsal  heads  and toes and acute tendon injury.

ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 8 Chronic Foot Pain  MRI Foot  
MRI allows the visualization of bone marrow edema patterns, which improve s the detection of fractures in cases of 
negative or inconclusive radiographs [70] . The utility of MRI in the detection of radiographically occult Chopart 
fractures has been demonstrated by Almeida et al [64] . Baker et al [71]  analyzed 31 occult fractures involving the 
ankle and foot in h ockey players,  finding five occult fractures in the foot, all of which involved the navicular bone. 
Pierre -Jerome et al [72] found 79% of cuboid fractures in the diabetic population that were radiographically occult 
using MRI. MRI is also useful in the detection of occult fractures involving the fifth metatarsal bone (Jones fracture) 
and the subtalar join t [65,73] . There is no evidence in the literature supporting the routine use of contrast in the 
diagnosi s of occult fractures.  
MRI has replaced bone scans in the evaluation of symptomatic accessory ossicles. MRI allows optimal visualization 
of the bone marrow within the ossicle and visualization of the synchondrosis. Accessory ossicles may also be 
associated  with tendon pathology, which is also well assessed on MRI [74]. MRI allows clear demonstration of the 
findings often associated with posterior ankle impingement syndrome [75]. Contrast administration is not routinely 
performed when assessing symptomatic accessory ossicles on MRI; however, contrast within a disrupted 
synchondrosis may be demonstrated on MR arthrography stu dies [69]. 
US Foot   
Although not routinely performed, previous studies have demonstrated the role of US in the detection of occult foot 
fractures. On US, these can be seen as cortical irregularities and are frequently associated with soft -tissue injury in 
the acute or subacute setting. Wang et al [76]  demonstrated 24 cases of radiographically occult ankle and foot 
fractures in 268 patients. Of these, foot fractures were found most frequently in the calcaneus and metatarsals, and 
less frequently in the navicular, cuboid , and cuneiform bones.
