   - Previous Diagnosis: Mild degenerative changes in the wrist observed on X-rays
   - Stage of Diagnosis: Next study, as X-rays have already been performed

2. An MRI arthrography of the right wrist is a suitable imaging procedure to assess for a triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) injury, which could be causing the patient's symptoms. This procedure involves the injection of a contrast material into the wrist joint before the MRI scan, which can help to highlight any damage to the TFCC. However, a standard MRI without contrast could also be considered as a less invasive alternative, although it may not provide as detailed an image of the TFCC.

3. Based on the scoring criteria, the scan order of an MRI arthrography of the right wrist to assess for TFCC injury is USUALLY APPROPRIATE. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of a possible TFCC injury, and the MRI arthrography can provide a detailed assessment of this structure.

   - Previous diagnosis: Obesity, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia
   - X-ray findings: No significant abnormality
   - This is an initial imaging study for the patient's symptoms.

2. The ordered scan is an MRI of the right wrist without IV contrast to assess for carpal tunnel syndrome. This is a non-invasive imaging technique that can provide detailed images of the soft tissues, including the median nerve and surrounding structures in the wrist. It can help confirm the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome, especially in cases where the clinical findings are equivocal or when surgical intervention is being considered. However, it's worth noting that the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome is primarily clinical, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Electrophysiological studies, such as nerve conduction studies, are usually the next step if the diagnosis is unclear or if surgery is being considered.

3. Based on the scoring criteria, the scan order of an MRI of the right wrist without IV contrast to assess for carpal tunnel syndrome is MAY BE APPROPRIATE. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of carpal tunnel syndrome, and while an MRI can provide additional information, it is not typically the first-line imaging study for this condition.

   - Previous Diagnosis: None mentioned, but X-rays show no gross destructive bone lesion.
   - Stage of Diagnosis: This would be considered the next study, as an X-ray has already been performed.

2. In this case, the patient's symptoms and the fact that she has been volunteering in an African community hospital suggest the possibility of an infectious disease such as tuberculosis (TB). MRI arthrography can be useful in assessing for TB tenosynovitis, but it is an invasive procedure that involves injecting a contrast material into the joint. A non-contrast MRI of the wrist might be a less invasive alternative that could still provide useful information about the soft tissues and any possible infection. However, if TB tenosynovitis is strongly suspected, the arthrography could provide more detailed information.

3. Based on the scoring criteria, the scan order for MRI arthrography of the left wrist to assess for TB tenosynovitis MAY BE APPROPRIATE. This is because the patient's symptoms and history suggest the possibility of an infectious disease such as TB, and the MRI arthrography could provide detailed information about the condition of the joint.

2. Considering the patient's age, symptoms, and previous diagnosis, an MRI of the knees can provide detailed images of the structures within the knee, including cartilage, tendons, ligaments, and bones. This can help to further assess the extent of degenerative changes. However, the use of IV contrast may not be necessary in this case. The contrast is typically used to better visualize inflammation, tumors, or blood vessels, which does not seem to be the primary concern here. Therefore, an MRI without IV contrast might be a more appropriate imaging procedure.

3. Based on the scoring criteria, the scan order of an MRI of the bilateral knees with and without IV contrast is MAY BE APPROPRIATE. The MRI can provide valuable information about the degenerative changes in the knees, but the use of IV contrast may not be necessary and could potentially expose the patient to unnecessary risks.
