these limitations, US still provides  an excellent  method  to assess repair  integrity, with a high sensitivity  (80.8%)  
and specificity  (100%)  for recurrent  rotator  cuff tear [158] . The ability  to perform  provocative  maneuvers can 
further demonstrate abnormalities  that other  forms  of imaging  would be incapable  identifying.  
Summary  of Recommendations 
• Variant 1 : Radiography is usually appropriate for the initial imaging of chronic shoulder pain.  
• Variant 2 : US or MR arthrography or MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study 
in the evaluation of chronic shoulder pain when  radiographs are normal or inconclusive and rotator cuff 
disorders or subacromial subdeltoid bursitis (no prior surgery)  is suspected . These procedures are equivalent 
alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage 
the patient’s care).  
• Variant 3 : Image -guided anesthetic +/ - corticosteroid injection  is usually appropriate as the next imaging study 
in the evaluation of chronic shoulder pain when radiographs demonstrate calcific tendinopathy or calcific bursitis.

Appropriately positioned  radiographs can exclude shoulder dislocation and most displaced fractures as the 
etiology for post -traumatic shoulder pain. In the setting of normal shoulder radiographs, the most common causes 
of post -traumatic shoulder pain are soft -tissue injuries such  as rotator cuff and labral tears.  
MRI Shoulder  
Noncontrast MRI is a reasonable imaging study in the setting of acute nonlocalized traumatic shoulder pain and 
noncontributory radiographs. In the acute trauma setting, noncontrast MRI may be preferred to MR arthrography , 
as acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint effusion for assessment of intra -articular 
soft-tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic 
pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [34,35]. MRI is also sensitive for diagnosing bone marrow 
contusion and has  been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries in pediatric patients [ 36,37]. 
MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography has been found to be superior to noncontrast MRI in the diagnosis of labroligamentous and 
partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [17,19]. In the acute trauma setting, however, noncontrast MRI may be 
preferred to MR arthrography because acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint

of the sacroiliac joints  and spine  in axSpA  [9,107-111,125 -129] . The Spondyloarthritis  Research  Consortium  of 
Canada and Berlin  methods  have  been  used as scoring  systems for quantification  and follow -up of lesions in the 
sacroiliac joints  and spine  on MRI [138-140]. 
Radiography Sacroiliac  Joints   
There is no standard  method of following  patients  with radiographs  to evaluate for progression of structural  changes  
[22], and the American  College  of Rheumatology recommends against  routine  radiographic  follow -up given  the 
lack of proven benefit  [30]. Repeat  radiographs  can be obtained as necessary  for counseling  patients  on the status  
and prognosis  of their disease,  although radiographs  are more  typically  performed  to evaluate the spine  rather  than 
the sacroiliac  joints  [30]. This is because of  the low utility  of sacroiliac joint radiographs  for detecting  disease  
progression based  on the relatively  poor intra- and interreader  reliability  of interpretation  [141] . Radiographs  can 
demonstrate evolving  structural  changes or bone  formation,  although these changes occur  slowly  over time at the 
sacroiliac joints, often  requiring  years to detect  a change and prompting many  authors  to suggest  a radiographic  
imaging  interval  of axSpA  patients  of no less than 2 years for assessment  of disease progression [141- 146]. There 
is evidence that patients  on TNF -inhibitors  may have  slower  progression of structural  damage at the sacroiliac joints  
[147,148] , although there is some  disagreement  in the literature  [149] .

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 6 Acute Hand and Wrist Trauma  Like CT, MRI shows intra -articular extension of distal radius fractures more frequently than radiography.  Unlike 
CT, MRI shows concomitant ligament  injuries, including tears of the scapholunate ligament, which may affect 
surgical treatment [26,27]. Despite these advantages,  MRI performed immediately at the time of injury has little 
added value for determining which patients go on to surgery [ 23]. 
MRI is especially useful in evaluating  hand soft -tissues injuries, including the collateral ligaments, volar plates, 
tendons, and pulleys. For metacarpal and digital fractures, MRI is usually not indicated during acute injury [ 22]. 
There is no evidence to support the use of MRI with IV contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist trauma.  
US Area of Interest  
US may have a limited utility  for evaluating bone injuries. Christiansen et al  [28] reported 47% sensitivity and 
61% specificity of US  for the detection of scaphoid fractures . They concluded that US  is not suitable for the early 
diagnosis of scaphoid fracture.  In contrast, Hauger et al  [29] reported that using cortical disruption as a diagnostic 
criterion on US is an accurate sign for detecting occult fractures of the scaphoid waist. Further study of US  for the 
diagnosis of occult fractures is needed . 
Bone Scan Area of  Interest  
Bone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  
Variant 3: Acute wrist fracture on radiographs. Suspect wrist tendon or ligament trauma. Next imaging 
study. 
Radiography Wrist  
Assessment of carpal instability with conventional radiographs requires careful attention to radiographic 
positioning.  In low -grade injuries, radiographs are usually normal.  Scapholunate diastasis of >4 mm and dorsal til t 
of the lunate of > 10° suggests dorsal intercalated segmental instability  [30,31].

US Hand  
A Stener lesion occurs when the aponeurosis of the adductor pollicis muscle becomes interposed between the 
ruptured ulnar collateral ligament of the thumb and its site  of insertion at the base of the proximal phalanx. This 
lesion can be identified by absence of ulnar collateral ligament and the presence of a hypoechoic mass proximal to 
the apex of the metacarpal tubercle [64]. Dynamic examination shows the relationship of the aponeurosis to the

• Variant 2 : In the setting of chronic hip pain with negative or nondiagnostic radiographs, MRI hip  without IV 
contrast or US hip  is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for suspected noninfectious extra -articular 
abnormality, such as tendonitis or bursitis.  These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure 
will be ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 5 Acute Hip Pain -Suspected Fracture  difficulty of older patients in tolerating  long scan times, there continues to be interest in developing rapid and 
accurate MRI protocols.  
With the diagnostic accuracy of noncontrast MRI approaching 100%, there has been little need to explore the 
addition of IV  gadolinium contrast solely for the purposes of fracture detection. Rather , the interest has been in 
the use of dynamic MRI to evaluate femoral head perfusion for prognostic purpose to estimate the risks of 
impaired perfusion,  such as osteonecrosis and non union. In one study of 36 patients, impaired femoral head 
perfusion was mor e common in patients with displaced fractures,  although there was considerable overlap of 
perfusion pattern and fracture type [44]. The accuracy of predicting successful osseous union was 75% based on 
fracture morphology and improved incrementally to 89% on the basis of perfusion dynamics. Only 2 of 16 
patients with nondisplaced fractures had osteonecrosis. A study from 2009 had similar results with  90% accuracy 
for prediction of successful fracture union on the basis of femoral head perfusion [45]. However, the study 
identified on ly 1 patient with a nondisplaced fracture with impaired femoral head perfusion and did not specify 
whether this patient went on to osteonecrosis, nor was the accuracy of predicting osteonecrosis on the basis of 
femoral head perfusion compared to that of the well -established Garden classification system. Given these 
findings, it is not clear if contrast-enhanced MRI offers significant advantages in the evaluation of the fractured 
hip compared to existing classification systems.  
CT Pelvis and Hips  
CT has advantages over MRI in terms of speed as well as use in patients with significant confusion. There has

Radiograph y Foot  
Radiographs  are indicated  by positive  Ottawa rules with 99% sensitivity  in determining  the presence of a foot 
fracture  [1,9,10] . Radiographs  are the mainstay  of initial imaging in the setting  of acute foot trauma.  Initial  
imaging typically  consists of a 3-view study  with the possibility  of additional  views as indicated  by the clinical  
setting  [8]. Additional  views,  such as axial  calcaneal  view,  can be useful  in patients  with suspected  calcaneal  
fracture  [15] because addition of this view  increases specificity  in diagnosing calcaneal  fractures  and sensitivity  in 
distinguishing intra-articular  calcaneal  fractures.  
Lisfranc  Injury  
When  there is a fairly  high clinical  suspicion  of an acute Lisfranc injury,  the foot should be imaged.  In addition  to 
a typical  3-view  radiographic  study  of the foot (anteroposterior  [AP],  oblique,  and lateral),  an AP view with 20° 
craniocaudal  angulation can be added  [16,17] . Although patients  with Lisfra nc sprains may incur  ligamentous  
damage  without  diastasis [18], radiography  should be the initial imaging modality  in the setting  of a suspected  
Lisfranc injury.

BMLs [30,31]. Similar to CT, MRI can calculate various anatomic measurements associated with patellofemoral 
subluxation/dislocation and lateral patellofemoral friction syndrome [32-34]. Bone marrow edema in the classic 
location for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also 
differentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise 
therapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. 
Other etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat

Radiography 
Radiography should be considered as the initial imaging study . Radiographs may reveal osteoarthritis, calcified or 
ossif ied intra -articular bodies, osteochondral abnormalities, stress fractures,  or evidence of prior trauma. Ankle 
effusions may also be identified in the anterior ankle joint recess by radiography with 53% to 74% accuracy  [19]. 
They are often associated with ligamentous injury or fracture [19]. The presence of ossific fragments can indicate 
ligamentous injury or retinaculum avulsion [20], whereas periostitis can occur adjacent to tenosynovitis. 
Radiographs can also identify synovial osteochondromatosis and erosions from chronic synovitis.

Radiography 
Radiography should be considered as the initial imaging study . Radiographs may reveal osteoarthritis, calcified or 
ossif ied intra -articular bodies, osteochondral abnormalities, stress fractures,  or evidence of prior trauma. Ankle 
effusions may also be identified in the anterior ankle joint recess by radiography with 53% to 74% accuracy  [19]. 
They are often associated with ligamentous injury or fracture [19]. The presence of ossific fragments can indicate 
ligamentous injury or retinaculum avulsion [20], whereas periostitis can occur adjacent to tenosynovitis. 
Radiographs can also identify synovial osteochondromatosis and erosions from chronic synovitis.

Page Content: The MRI findings that have been reported in wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome —
including nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing—may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value 
in patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68]. In rare cases of secondary carpal tunnel syndrome, MRI may identify 
a mass lesion compressing the median nerve. There is some evidence that the length of T2 hyperintensity in the 
median nerve can help prognosticate the success of surgery [69] and that the shape and signal of the nerve predict 
clinical response to a steroid injection in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome [70 ]. MR neurography 
may be an option in patients with suspected carpal tunnel syndrome.  The use o f IV contrast does not contribute to 
diagnosis and is usually not appropriate.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
MR arthrography is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.

Summary of Recommendations

MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate.  
• In patients with suspected inflammatory arthritis, MRI either with or without IV contrast is usually

Page Content: These factors make CT the 
preferred examination for suspected distal radioulnar joint subluxation, where images of both wrists can be  
obtained in both supination and pronation [1 ,13]. A disadvantage of CT  is its lower sensitivity to soft -tissue 
abnormalities  compared with MRI.  
High-resolution (typically multidetector) CT of the wrist following contrast injection into one or more wrist 
compartments (CT arthrography) is a powerful tool for diagnosing intra -articular abnormalities [14,15]. The 
intraobserver agreement on CT arthrogram images is extremely high and better than that reported for MRI 
[14,16]. 
US 
US of the wrist is useful for examining extra -articular soft tissues, such as suspected ganglion cyst s [17], because 
its accuracy is similar to that of MRI. US can also be used to diagnose abnormalities of the flexor and extensor 
tendons and tendon sheaths. For de Quervain disease (stenosing tenosynovitis of the abductor pollicis lon gus and 
extensor pollicis brevis tendon compartment), preoperative identification of a septum or subcompartmentalization 
within the first dorsal compartment with US  may affect surgical management [18 ,19]. 
In patients with suspected or established rheumatoid arthritis (RA), US examination of the wrist and selected 
finger joints can identify erosions and active synovit is (with the use of power Doppler), findings that influence 
early diagnosis and treatment decisions [20]. Using US to measure the size of the median nerve is a  validated  
technique in patients with clinical symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome [21-24].  
In addition, w rist US is a useful technique to guide therapeutic intr a-articular and other soft -tissue injections [25].

complications of the fracture.  
Variant 12: Chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or nonspecific. Suspect carpal tunnel syndrome.  Next

US Wrist 
Several meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the 
carpal  tunnel  inlet) is highly accurate for identifying carpal  tunnel syndrome  diagnosed clinically or with the 
combination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US 
varies depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the 
measurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary 
examination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel 
syndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal 
tunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, 
clinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of 
carpal tunnel syndrome. US may be appropriate in cases where this initial evaluation is equivocal.

Radiography Foot  
Conventional radiography can be useful to distinguish among different causes of chronic foot pain and is usually 
the first imag ing study in evaluating patients with chronic foot pain.  
The value of radiographs in the diagnosis of tarsal coalitions has been extensively demonstrated. Overall 
sensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs 
in the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral 
and oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar 
coalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs 
on the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have 
been found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable 
methods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  
Radiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review 
by Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for 
radiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.

Page Content: US is also useful  in the evaluation  for synovitis  and tenosynovitis,  aided  by the detection  of hyperemia via color  or 
Doppler  signal  [23]. Power  Doppler  US is more  accurate for the diagnosis  of synovitis  and has a higher  correlation  
with disease activity  compared  with grayscale US [35,36] . Synovitis  on power  Doppler  US and grayscale US are 
both associated  with the development  of radiographic  erosions  in patients  with RA compared  with grayscale US 
[37,38] . Newer  techniques  for detecting  microvascularization  associated  with joint inflammation  like multimodal  
photoacoustic/ US and ultra-microangiography have  shown  promise  as indicators  of disease activity  [39,40] . 
US also provides  prognostic  information  (such  as detecting  synovitis)  that is linked to disease progression [13], 
although  mild synovial  hypertrophy as an isolated  finding  is not specific and has limited  relevance [41]. In the 
evaluation  of the finger  joints  with US, dorsal  evaluation  is recommended  over palmar  [42]. Abbreviated  US 
scanning  protocols  of the hands,  wrists,  and feet to improve  efficiency  have  been  described  [43-46].

Page Content: These factors make CT the 
preferred examination for suspected distal radioulnar joint subluxation, where images of both wrists can be  
obtained in both supination and pronation [1 ,13]. A disadvantage of CT  is its lower sensitivity to soft -tissue 
abnormalities  compared with MRI.  
High-resolution (typically multidetector) CT of the wrist following contrast injection into one or more wrist 
compartments (CT arthrography) is a powerful tool for diagnosing intra -articular abnormalities [14,15]. The 
intraobserver agreement on CT arthrogram images is extremely high and better than that reported for MRI 
[14,16]. 
US 
US of the wrist is useful for examining extra -articular soft tissues, such as suspected ganglion cyst s [17], because 
its accuracy is similar to that of MRI. US can also be used to diagnose abnormalities of the flexor and extensor 
tendons and tendon sheaths. For de Quervain disease (stenosing tenosynovitis of the abductor pollicis lon gus and 
extensor pollicis brevis tendon compartment), preoperative identification of a septum or subcompartmentalization 
within the first dorsal compartment with US  may affect surgical management [18 ,19]. 
In patients with suspected or established rheumatoid arthritis (RA), US examination of the wrist and selected 
finger joints can identify erosions and active synovit is (with the use of power Doppler), findings that influence 
early diagnosis and treatment decisions [20]. Using US to measure the size of the median nerve is a  validated  
technique in patients with clinical symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome [21-24].  
In addition, w rist US is a useful technique to guide therapeutic intr a-articular and other soft -tissue injections [25].

including nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing—may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value 
in patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68]. In rare cases of secondary carpal tunnel syndrome, MRI may identify 
a mass lesion compressing the median nerve. There is some evidence that the length of T2 hyperintensity in the

may be an option in patients with suspected carpal tunnel syndrome.  The use o f IV contrast does not contribute to 
diagnosis and is usually not appropriate.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
MR arthrography is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.  
CT Wrist  
CT, with or without IV  contrast, is not routinely used to diagnose carpa l tunnel syndrome.  
CT Arthrography  Wrist  
CT arthrography is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.  
Bone Scan  Wrist  
Bone scan is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.  
Arthrography  Wrist  
Radiographic arthrography  is not routinely us ed to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome . 
Summary of Recommendations  
• Wrist radiographs are indicated as the best initial imaging examination in patients with chronic wrist pain. 
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal and a patient has persistent symptoms wi th an unclear diagnosis, 
MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate.  
• In patients with suspected inflammatory arthritis, MRI either with or without IV contrast is usually 
appropriate if guidance for management or prognostication is needed.  
• Patients with  suspected wrist infection should undergo aspiration.

Page Content: These factors make CT the 
preferred examination for suspected distal radioulnar joint subluxation, where images of both wrists can be  
obtained in both supination and pronation [1 ,13]. A disadvantage of CT  is its lower sensitivity to soft -tissue 
abnormalities  compared with MRI.  
High-resolution (typically multidetector) CT of the wrist following contrast injection into one or more wrist 
compartments (CT arthrography) is a powerful tool for diagnosing intra -articular abnormalities [14,15]. The 
intraobserver agreement on CT arthrogram images is extremely high and better than that reported for MRI 
[14,16]. 
US 
US of the wrist is useful for examining extra -articular soft tissues, such as suspected ganglion cyst s [17], because 
its accuracy is similar to that of MRI. US can also be used to diagnose abnormalities of the flexor and extensor 
tendons and tendon sheaths. For de Quervain disease (stenosing tenosynovitis of the abductor pollicis lon gus and 
extensor pollicis brevis tendon compartment), preoperative identification of a septum or subcompartmentalization 
within the first dorsal compartment with US  may affect surgical management [18 ,19]. 
In patients with suspected or established rheumatoid arthritis (RA), US examination of the wrist and selected 
finger joints can identify erosions and active synovit is (with the use of power Doppler), findings that influence 
early diagnosis and treatment decisions [20]. Using US to measure the size of the median nerve is a  validated  
technique in patients with clinical symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome [21-24].  
In addition, w rist US is a useful technique to guide therapeutic intr a-articular and other soft -tissue injections [25].

US Wrist 
Several meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the 
carpal  tunnel  inlet) is highly accurate for identifying carpal  tunnel syndrome  diagnosed clinically or with the 
combination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US 
varies depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the 
measurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary 
examination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel 
syndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal 
tunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, 
clinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of 
carpal tunnel syndrome. US may be appropriate in cases where this initial evaluation is equivocal.

Dual -energy CT without  IV contrast may be indicated if gout  or mixed crystal disease is a consideration.  
Otherwise, CT i s not commonly used as a diagnostic test to evaluate patients with osteoarthritis or 
chondrocalcinosis.  Limited CT without IV contrast can be used for surgical planning.  
CT Arthrography  Knee  
CT arthrography is not commonly utilized as a second test in pati ents with arthritis even though CT is the most 
accurate method for evaluating cartilage abnormalities extending to the articular surface that is  due to the high 
spatial resolution between the contrast and the cartilage [11].  
MRI Knee  
MRI without IV contrast is not usually indicated in patients for whom radiographs are diagnostic of osteoarthritis 
unless symptoms are not explained by the radiographic findings (eg, s tress fractures) or the appropriate treatment 
option requires additional imaging [11, 19]. 
Given the increased sensitivity of MRI for osteoarthritis, MRI may be indicated when more accurate or serial 
cartilage measurements are desired [10 ,55,56]. In patients >70 years of age, a higher correlation with the 
“abnormal” knee being painful is present when structural abnormalities are unilateral on either radiographs or 
MRI. S ince bilateral structural abnormalities can be present with primarily unilateral symptoms, the ability to 
discriminate painful from nonpainful knees is limited [57] . This persists even when using the MRI presence of 
synovitis or effusion and/or a Kellgren and Lawrence score of ≥ 2; findings were reported to be the best 
discriminators between painful and asymptomatic knees [19].  
Patellofemoral cartilage loss is closely associated with chronic knee pain with active knee pain correlated with BMLs [56]. Since MRI is more accurate than physical examination in identifying severe grades of 
chondromalacia patellae, it may be an appropriate screening tool prior to arthroscopy [58 ].

Bone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the 
subchondral bone.  New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or 
patients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee 
pain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the 
origin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. 
Subchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed 
spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to 
elderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs 
often initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, 
and progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is 
suspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria
® 
topic on “ Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae ” [28]. 
Some patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using 
quantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs 
exhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ].

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 16 Chronic Shoulder Pain  MRI Shoulder  Without  and With  IV Contrast  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of MRI  shoulder  without  and with IV contrast  in the evaluation  of 
chronic  shoulder  pain with a history  of prior  rotator  cuff repair  when  a rotator  cuff disorder  or subacromial  
subdeltoid bursitis  is suspected.  
MRI Shoulder  Without  IV Contrast  
MRI is useful  in the evaluation  of the postoperative  rotator  cuff. The shift from  metallic  to bioabsorbable  suture  
anchors  tends  to result  in fewer  cases  with metal  artifact  implications  [153] . For patients  with meta llic suture  
anchors,  there are a variety  of commercially  available metal  artifact  reduction sequences,  which  can limit artifact.  
MRI can demonstrate  complications  with suture  anchors  such as osteolys is or migration  [154] , even  if the suture  
anchors  are nonmetallic . MRI can also demonstrate potential improvements  in muscle  atrophy and fatty infiltration  
after rotator  cuff repair  [155,156] .  
Radiography Shoulder  Additional Views  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of additional  radiographic  views in the evaluation  of chronic  
shoulder  pain with a history  of prior  rotator  cuff repair  when  rotator  cuff disorder  or subacromial  subdeltoid bursitis  
is suspected.  
US Shoulder  
An advantage  of US evaluation  of the postoperative  shoulder  is the absence  of metal -induced artifact  when  
examining the rotator  cuff and adjacent  soft tissues.  Patients  who have  undergone  rotator  cuff repair  may show  
discrete defects on US imaging  that may persist  for years with some  potential for delayed  healing  [157] .

Page Content: In a retrospective review of 40 
pathologically confirmed telangiectatic osteosarcomas, Murph ey et al [ 22] noted that CT was the optimal imaging 
modality for demonstration of subtle matrix mineralization seen in 85% of cases in the intraosseous or soft -tissue 
components of the lesion. Not all studies conclude that one modality, CT or MRI, is better than the ot her. A multi-
institutional collaborative study assessing the relative accuracy of CT and MRI in the local staging of primary 
malignant musculoskeletal neoplasms showed no statistically significant difference between CT and MRI in 
determining tumor involvem ent of muscle, bone, joints, or neurovascular structures. Further more , the combined 
interpretation of CT and MRI did not significantly improve accuracy [ 23]. Advanced CT techniques, such as dual -
energy CT, have shown promise in differentiating malignant from nonmalignant tumors, although further research 
in this area is needed [ 24]. MRI is generally considered the preferred imaging modal ity for staging of bone 
tumors. Some cases may benefit from both MRI and CT because these modalities provide  comple mentary 
information regarding soft -tissue (often better evaluated on MR I) and matrix mineralization (often better 
evaluated on CT).  
There is no relevant literature regarding the specific use of CT with IV contrast or CT without and with IV 
contrast in the evaluation of suspected primary bone tumor with radiographs indeterminate for malignancy.  
However, if contrast is given, CT without and with IV contrast is preferred because it allows differentiati on of 
areas of contrast enhancement from areas of osseous matrix production . 
FDG -PET/CT Whole Body  
FDG-PET has proven useful for further characterizing indeterminate bone tumors identified on radiogra phs. PET 
information can be co-registered with CT or MRI, taking advantage of the inherent benefits of these modalities.

may be useful in some cases to identify alternative diagnoses such as osteomyelitis.  
Bone Scan Whole Body  
Bone scan is sensitive for the detection of osteoid osteoma but lacks specificity  [19].  
Bone Scan Whole Body  with SPECT or SPECT/CT Area of Interest  
Bone scan is sensitive for the detection of osteoid osteoma but lacks specificity. Single -photon emission 
computed tomography  (SPECT) or SPECT/CT may help improve specificity  [19]. 
US Area of Interest  
US is not routinely used in the evaluation of suspected osteoid osteoma. There is no relevant literature regarding 
the use of US in the evaluation of suspected osteoid osteoma.  
Variant 5 : Suspect primary bone tumor. Lesion on r adiographs . Indeterminate or aggressive appearance 
for malignancy. Next imaging study.  
Lesions seen on radiographs that are not definitely benign often require additional characterization using 
advanced imaging studies such as MRI or CT.  The next best imaging examination is not always clearly defined 
because the choice will be influenced by the radiographic appearance of the lesion, location , number of lesions, 
availability of imaging equipment, plan for biopsy/treatment , as well as underlying patient -specific clinical 
parameters.  
CT Area of Interest  
CT continues to play a role in the evaluation of indeterminate bone l esions discovered on radiographs, particularly 
in lesions with mineralized matrix or in suspected cases of osteoid osteoma (see Variant 4). Both MRI and CT 
have been used to evaluate the degree of cortical involvement in chondroid lesions [ 20]. In comparison with 
radiographs and MRI, CT has been shown to better delineate the presence of cortical destruction and the character 
of matrix mineralizatio n patterns in patients with clear cell chondrosarcoma [21].

bone mass decreases slowly over time, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age, and differs by sex, race, 
ethnicity  [10], and comorbidities. In line with the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations for patients  
ages 65 and older being screened for osteoporosis, patients  >65 years of age may be considered at risk for 
osteoporotic fracture when presenting with LBP . 
Additionally,  for those  patients without  neurologic  compromise  and who present  with minor  risk factors for cancer,  
inflammatory  back  disease  (eg, ankylosing spondylitis), vertebral  compression  fracture,  or symptomatic  spinal  
stenosis,  imaging  should be considered  after a trial of therapy  [4]. 
In the majority  of patients, no specific pathology for LBP can be identified. Also,  studies have  shown  imaging  
abnormalities  in a substantial  number  of people  without back  pain [11-13]. The challenge for the clinician, therefore,  
is to distin guish the small  segment  within  this large patient  population that should be evaluated  further because of 
suspicion  of a more  serious  problem  or identify  pathology that requires intervention . 
Other  nonspine  causes of LBP can have overlap  in clinical  presentation,  including inflammatory  arthritis  and other  
systemic conditions , such as pelvic,  renal,  vascular,  or gastrointestinal  etiologies.  If an inflammatory  etiology  is 
suspected  as the cause of LBP, such as ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic  spondylitis, reactive arthritis, or 
inflammatory  bowel  disease– related  spine  disorders,  please see the ACR  Appropriateness Criteria® topic  on 
“Inflammatory Back Pain: Known or Suspected Axial Spondyloarthropathy ” [14].

When  studied,  there was no statistically  significant  difference in primary  outcome  after 1 year for patients  aged  65 
years or older  who had spine  imaging  within  6 weeks after an initial  visit for care for LBP versus similar  patients  
who did not undergo early  imaging  [9]; thus,  this document  does not include  >50 years of age as an independent  
red flag. However, an important age-related risk factor for spinal fracture presenting as LBP  is osteoporosis.

MRI.  The visualization  of the convex  posterior  vertebral  body  border,  extension  into the posterior  elements,  and 
abnormal  marrow  signal  are suggestive  of pathologic  fracture  [58]. 
Radiography Lumbar  Spine  
In patients  with history  of osteoporosis  or steroid  use, initial evaluation  with radiography  is useful  [55]. Radiography  
with anteroposterior  and lateral  radiographs  is useful  for assessing  LBP in patients  with low suspicion  of trauma  or 
minor  trauma  and patients  suspected  of having possible vertebral  compression  fracture.  Upright  radiographs  provide  
useful  functional  information  about  axial  loading.  Flexion  and extension  views can be performed  to evaluate for 
spine  stability. Evaluation  of the extent  of vertebral  body  comminution  is limited  on radiography,  particularly  in

There is no defined role for US  in evaluation of proximal humeral  fractures. Although fractures may sometimes 
be visible on US as areas of cortical interruption, US  is unable to reliably characterize fracture patterns. In ideal 
conditions, US is effective at identifying full-thickness rotator cuff tears that may be associated with humeral head 
fractures [17,22,44]. However, in the acute setting of humeral head fractur e, an US examination of the shoulder is 
significantly limited by decreased patient mobility and swelling. 
FDG -PET/CT  Skull Base to Mid-Thigh 
FDG-PET in combination with CT  has been shown to be reliable in differentiating benign from malignant 
pathologic fr actures [27]. FDG-PET/CT can be used to further assess suspected pathologic fractures of the 
proximal humerus.  
Bone Scan  Shoulder  
Bone scintigraphy has sensitivity and specificity comparable to MRI in diagnosis of occult bone fractures, and 
bone scintigraphy can be used  to identify other foci of bone involvement in pathologic fractures due to metastatic 
disease  [31,32]. Bone scintigraphy can be used  to characterize proximal humerus fractures suspected to be due to 
metastatic disease.  
Variant 4: Traumatic shoulder pain. Radio graphs show scapula fracture.  Next imaging study. 
There is no consensus on indications for surgical fixation of scapula fractures. In general, isolated scapula body 
fractures heal well without surgical fixation, although associated rib fractures or higher injury severity score are 
associated with worse clinical outcomes and may benefit from more aggressive surgical fixation [ 45]. Scapula 
fractures involving the glenoid articular surface or glenoid neck may also require surgical fixation.

Because of the scapula’s complex osteology and overlying ribs, scapula fractures can be easily missed or

Page Content: Finally, stress fractures of the femoral head are high  risk in healthy patients and , if not recognized promptly, have 
increased  rates of delayed union, nonunion, displacement, and avascular necrosis [17]. Given the importance of 
recognizing these high-risk fractures in the femoral head and neck, MRI is the preferred second -line study after  
initial negative  radiographs to prevent delayed diagnosis.  
Variant 3: Suspected stress (fatigue) fracture, excluding hip  and vertebrae. Negative radiographs. Next 
imaging study.  
See variant 2. Certain stress fractures are considered high  risk based on a tendency for nonunion or delayed union. 
High -risk stress fractures include the anterior tibial diaphysis, lateral femoral neck and femoral head (see variant 
2), patella, medial malleolus, navicular, fifth metatarsal base, proximal second metatarsal, tibial hallux sesamoid, 
and talus  [43]. 
The second -line test to diagnose a stress fracture should be guided by the location of the patient ’s pain and 
likelihood of high-risk injury. A follow -up radiographic examination has increased sensitivity compared to initial 
radiographs [8] but is less sensitive than MRI. MRI is extremely sensitive and demonstrates stress abnormalities 
as early as bone scintigraphy and with as much sensitivity [ 11-14]. The recent literature favors MRI as the 
procedure of choice for making an early diagnosis of both varieties of stress fractures [ 15-28 ]. MRI is also 
considerably more specifi c than bone scintigraphy [ 19,23]. Stress injuries in athletes that are not identified and 
managed in a timel y fashion can progress to more serious fractures. Preventive strategies, including identifying 
and modifying risk factors, may help deter progression to frank fractures [31,44,45]. 
A circumstance that deserves specific attention is the longitudinal stress fracture, particularly in the tibia. Up to 
25% may appear n ormal on radiographs, but CT or MRI findings are characteristic [ 13,46].

Page Content: Computed tomography  
CT is not typically used as a first - or second -line imaging tool in the workup of stress fractures  but may offer an 
adjunct role when other im aging modalities are equivocal [ 23], particularly in the pelvis or sacrum . Although  
superior to radiography, it is less sensitive than nu clear scintigraphy or MRI [19]. The benefit of CT seems to lie 
in its specificity, ranging from 88%  to 98% in a recent meta-analysis looking at diagnostic accuracy of imaging 
modalities for lower -extremity stress fractures, and thus may confirm a suspected stress fracture based on MRI  
[32]. However, CT does involve ionizing radiation, so it is typically used only when MRI is equivocal.  For the 
evaluation of stress fractures, intravenous contrast is not helpful as a part of CT examinations.  
Ultrasound  
There is limited evidence on the u tility of ultrasound in diagnosing stress fractures. Ultrasound is a first -line 
imaging modality in assessing muscles, tendons, joints, and nerves in the extremities  [33], so the radiologist 
should know the typical sono graphic appearance of stress fractures. S onographic findings of s tress fractures 
include  subcutaneous edema , periosteal thickening, cortical bone irregularity, local hyperemia  [33-35 ], and 
periosteal callus.  Overall, ultrasound appears to be more sensitive than specif ic [32], and similar ultrasound 
findings can be seen in osteomyelitis or neoplasm. Furthermore, ultrasound cannot evalua te the subcortical bone, 
so trabecular stress fractures may be missed. Although touted as cheap and quick to perform , it is limited a s an 
operator -dependent modality.

See variants 1  through  3. On initial diagnosis, MRI can be used to  predict t ime to return to play in athletes. 
Fredericson et al  [48] retrospectively correlated return to activity with an MRI grading system based on the 
pattern of periosteal and marrow edema on T1-weighted  and fat -suppressed T 2-weighted sequences. Similar 
findings were confirmed in other studies  [49-51] , including  that the finding of abnormal cortical signal intensity 
or a fracture line was of prognostic value [ 51] and that MRI performed better in predicting return to activity than 
radiographs , bone scintigraphy, or CT [50,52]. 
A recent prospective study in university athletes found that MRI grading s everity, total-body bone mineral density 
evaluated by dual -energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and location of injury (ie , cortical or trabecular bone)  
were important variables for predicting time to full return to sport [ 31]. In this study, periosteal edema as 
described by Fredericson et al [ 48] was not associated with return to sport . Using the modified grading scale and a 
multiple regression model, for every 1- unit increase in MRI grade, the time to full return to sport increased by 
approximately 48 days [31] . Furthermore, trabecular st ress injuries (eg , femur neck and pubic bone ) were 
associated with a longer time to return to sport than cortical bone stress injuries. In addition, decreased bone 
mineral density leads to increased time to return to sport . Therefore, bone mineral density provides additional 
diagnostic and prognostic information [31]. The model of MRI  grade, trabecular versus cortical bone sit e, and 
total-body bone mineral density a ccounted for 68% of the variation in time to return to sport [ 31].",False

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 17 Suspected Spine Trauma Arteriography Cervicocerebral 
There is no role for arteriography in the assessment of  patients with persistent pain on follow-up visit with 
cervical collar in place. 
Variant 9: Age greater than or equal to 16 years. Blunt trauma meeting criteria for thoracic and lumbar 
imaging. Initial imaging. 
Imaging is a crucial component in assessment of thoracic and lumbar spine injury. Fr om 1998 to 2011, there was 
an adjusted annual increase of approximately 8% in thor acolumbar spine fractures in patients involved in motor 
vehicle collisions [15]. Thoracolumbar fractures are cha llenging to identify clinically, with only 48% to 75% of 
thoracolumbar injuries identified on clinical examination [16-18]. Unlike cervical injuries, well-defined clinical 
criteria have not been established to determine when thor acolumbar imaging is appropriate in the setting of blunt 
traumatic injury. Since clinical examination has poor sen sitivity for identifying thoracolumbar injuries, any high-
risk patient (mid line thoracolumbar tenderness, high-energ y mechanism of injury, or >60 years of age), as well as 
unexaminable patients (intoxicated, GCS <15, distracting injury), should undergo imaging of the thoracolumbar 
spine. Screening of the entire spine is advised, as an es timated 20% of spine injuries will have a second associated 
spinal injury at a noncontiguous level [26,27]. 
Radiography  Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
It is well established that CT outperforms radiographs in  the diagnosis of thoracolumbar spine fractures [104-
108]. Radiographs have a reported sens itivity of 49% to 62% for identifying thoracic spine fractures and 67% to 
82% sensitivity for identifying lumbar spine fractures [ 104,107,108] compared with the reported sensitivity of 
94% to 100% for identifying thoracolumbar spine fract ures using CT [104,107,108].

radiographs or noncontrast CT. Neurologic abnormalities. Next imaging study. 
CT Myelography Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
CT myelography can be performed to assess for traumatic spinal canal narrowing that is due to disc herniation or 
epidural hematoma and to assess for preganglionic nerve root avulsions. Ho wever, as with conventional CT, CT 
myelography is inferior to MRI in assessing cord contus ion, cord hemorrhage, and postganglionic nerve root 
injuries [40,41,43,57]. Performance of thoracolumbar CT myelogram can also be technically challenging, 
particularly in patients with suspected  unstable thoracolumbar spine injury. 
CT Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
CT does play a role in the initial assessment of thoracic and lumbar spine injury. However, CT is significantly 
inferior to MRI in identifying many soft-tissue pathologies,  such as cord contusion, epidural hematoma, and nerve 
root avulsions that can cause neurologic deficits re quiring surgical intervention [40,41,43,57]. Therefore, CT 
should not be considered adequate for excluding signifi cant soft-tissue pathology in patients presenting with 
thoracolumbar spine trauma and neurologic deficit. 
MRI Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
MRI should be performed in patients who have possible spinal  cord injury, in whom there is clinical concern for 
cord compression that is due to disc protrusion or hema toma, and in those suspected of ligamentous instability. 
MRI is valuable for characterizing the cause of myelopathy in  patients with spinal cord  injury. The severity of the 
injury—including extent of intramedullary hemorrhage , length of edema, and evidence of cord transection—
contributes to predicting outcome.",True

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 6 Myelopathy patients  with relapsing -remitting  MS [12]. When myelopathy due to MS is suspected,  MRI detection  of spinal  cord 
lesion(s)  fulfills  part of the 2016  MAGNIMS  criteria  [63]. Other  demyelinating  processes such as NMO and ADEM  
can present  as chronic  myelopathy less commonly.  In patients  with chronic  or progressive myelopathy,  MRI  of the 
spinal  cord can identify  spinal  cord lesions suggestive  of demyelinating  disease in addition  to excluding  alternative  
etiologie s. Contrast -enhanced  imaging  is recommended  for initial diagnostic  evaluation  [69,70] . 
Metabolic  causes of chronic  or progressive  myelopathy result  in changes in the spinal  cord known  as subacute 
combined degeneration  and are best evaluated  with MRI [11,83,84] . Chronic  infections  can have  a similar  
appearance [12].  
Radiation -induced  myelopathy is a rare dose-dependent  complication  that anatomically  localizes to a prior  radiation  
port [85]. Autoimmune  myelitis  includes  paraneoplastic myelopathy [86,87] . MRI  without  and with IV contrast  is 
useful  to evaluate the spinal  cord in these instances.  
Vascular  malformations  can likewise present  with chronic  and slowly  progressive  myelopathy [88]. MRI without  
and with IV contrast  is useful  to demonstrate spinal  cord edema  caused  by venous  hypertension and enlarged  veins  
along the dorsal  surface of the spinal  cord.  There may be patchy  intramedullary  enhancement  due to breakdown  of 
the blood-cord  barrier.  In some  cases,  abnormal  vasculature may be identified  that may be useful  to guide  spinal  
arteriography  and intervention [5,89-91] .

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 4 Myelopathy Intramedullary  cord signal  changes on MRI in patients with spondylotic  myelopathy represent  prognostic  factors  
for neurosurgical  outcome  [21,37-41] . Intravenous  (IV) contrast  is typically  not required  for the diagnosis  of 
spondylotic  myelopathy,  but characteristic patterns of enhancement  can be seen immediately  at and below  a level  
of stenosis [42,43] . 
In patients  who have  undergone  spinal  surgery,  complications  in the early  postoperative  setting  (eg, hematoma)  can 
result  in extrinsic compression  of the spinal  cord and are best evaluated  using  MRI without  and with IV contrast  
[44]. 
In cases in which spinal  cord ischemia is suspected  as the cause for acute myelopathy,  MRI without and with IV 
contrast is useful in cases where spinal cord ischemic is suspected as the cause for acute myelopathy  [27,28,45-47] . 
Contrast  enhancement  is typically  not seen in the early  phase of acute ischemia and, if present,  may suggest  an 
alternative  inflammatory  or infectious  etiolog y [48]. Diffusion -weighted  imaging  can show  signal  alteration  in the 
spinal  cord earlier  after patient symptom  onset  compared  with T2-weighted  images  [49,50] . As such,  diffusion-
weighted  imaging  should be included anytime  there is concern  for spinal  cord ischemia [51]. 
When  considering  inflammatory  or infections  etiologies  of myelopathy,  visualization  of the osseous spinal column 
as well as the spinal  cord is useful  and best accomplished  noninvasively by MRI [4,7,45,52 -60]. 
Demyelinating  diseases such as MS and NMO can present  as acute myelopathy.

CES is rare and results from  dysfunction of the sacral  and lumbar  nerve  roots  within  the vertebral  canal  secondary  
to cauda equina  nerve  root compression , producing impairment  of the bladder,  bowel,  or sexual  function and 
perianal  or saddle numbness.  Back  pain with or without  radicular  symptoms,  weakness in the lower  limbs, sensory  
changes or numbness  in the lower  limbs,  or absent  lower  limb reflexes are other  symptoms  that have  been  described  
[38]. A review of physical  examination  findings  reported  by Fairbanks  et al [39] found LBP as the most  common  
physical  finding in patients  with the diagnosis  of CES.  The most  common  cause of CES is lumbar  disc herniation  
at the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels.  Other  etiologies  include  neoplasm,  infection/inflammation, spinal  stenosis,  and 
hemorrhage.

In the absence of red flags,  first-line treatment  for chronic  LBP remains conservative therapy  with both 
pharmacologic  and nonpharmacologic  (eg, exercise,  remaining  active)  therapy  [19]. However,  patients  presenting  
with subacute or chronic  LBP, with or without  radiculopathy,  who have  failed  6 weeks of conservative therapy  
should be imaged  if they are believed  to be candidates for surgery  or intervention  or if diagnostic  uncertainty  
remains.  The goal of imaging  is to identify  potential  actionable pain generators that could be targeted  for 
intervention  or surgery.  MRI of the lumbar  spine  has become  the initial imaging  modali ty of choice in these patients. 
MRI has excellent  soft-tissue contrast  and accurately  depicts lumbar  pathology,  including disc degeneration , as well 
as the thecal  sac and neural  structures [7]. However,  it is well known that many  MRI abnormalities  can be seen in 
asymptomatic individuals  and that imaging  patients  in this category  is often  not beneficial  [7,11,13,21] . MRI  may 
be helpful  when  there is LBP with radiculopathy  or signs  of spinal  stenosis,  which  suggests the presence of 
demonstrable  nerve  root compression  [13].

both the flexor and extensor wrist compartments [46]. Occult ganglion cysts are also easily identified with MRI, 
but some authors recommend use of IV contrast to distinguish ganglia from synovitis [ 47]. For noncystic soft-
tissue masses, MRI may demonstrate findings that are diagnostic for certain benign conditions (eg, lipomas, 
hemangiomas, benign nerve sheath tumors), and can stage the extent of involvement for nonspecific masses ( see 
the ACR Appropriateness Criteria® topic on “ Soft-Tissue Masses ” [48]).

For patients with a palpable mass or suspected ganglion cyst, or suspected radiographically occult fractures or stress fractures, either MRI or CT without contrast is usually appropriate.

Page Content: MRI with IV contrast  may be appropriate for these patients. Additionally, unlike the case 
for the knee and other larger joints, MRI shows only fair sensitivity for depicting articular cartilage defects in the 
distal radius and carpal bones, even with the use of indirect MR ar thrography or 3.0 T scanners [59,60]. The 
presence of focal bone marrow edema may be a clue to underl ying chondral defects [59]. Despite these 
limitations, noncontrast MRI and noncontrast CT are both usually appropriate exam ination s to evaluate potential 
sequelae of chronic scaphoid fractures, but only one of the tests needs to be performed for a given patient. The use 
of IV contrast for MR I may be appropriate in some cases.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
A single study found that direct MR arthrography was more sensitive for articular cartilage defects compared to 
conventional MRI, but the same study showed that CT arthrography was even more sensitive [38]. MR 
arthrography is not routinely used in this setting.  
CT Wrist  
Either CT without IV contrast or MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate in this scenario. CT historically 
has been the most commonly used examination to detect scaphoid nonunion, malun ion, osteonecrosis and wrist 
osteoarthritis in patients with chronic scaphoid fractures, despite a lack of evidence-b ased literature . IV contrast 
does not have added benefit in these patients  and is usually not appropriate . Either CT or MRI is usually 
appropriate in this setting, but only one of the tests is necessary.  
CT Arthrography  Wrist  
While CT arthrography may increase the sensitivi ty for articular cartilage defects [38], it is not routinely used in 
this setting.  
US Wrist  
Once a scap hoid fracture is identified, US does not contribute to the evaluation for complications of the fracture.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 17 Chronic Wrist Pain  • For patients with suspected Kienböck’s disease without radiographic confirmation, MRI without IV contrast 
is usually appropriate.  
• For patients with radiographic evidence of Kienböck’s disease, further imaging is usually not necessary. In 
selected circumstances,  either CT or MR without IV contrast may be appropriate for staging of the disease.  
• In patients with a palpable mass or suspected ganglion cyst, one of the examin ations , MRI without IV 
contrast, MRI with IV contrast, or wrist US , is usually appropriate.  
• Either MRI or CT without contrast is usually appropriate in patients with suspected radiographically  occult 
fractures or stress fractures.  
• Patients with prior scaph oid fractures and chronic pain should undergo either CT or MR without IV contrast 
to evaluate for fracture complications.  
• Suspected carpal tunnel syndrome is diagnosed by clinical evaluation combined with electrophysiologic studies. Further imaging is usua lly not needed, but in selected circumstances, either wrist US or MRI without 
contrast may be appropriate.  
Summary of Evidence  
Of the 71 references cited in the ACR Appropriateness Criteria
® Chronic Wrist Pain  document, all of them are 
categorized as diagn ostic references including 3 well -designed studies, 16 good-quality studies, and 23 quality 
studies that may have design limitations. There are 23 references that may not be useful as primary evidence. 
There are 6 references that are meta-analysis studies.  
The 71 references cited in the ACR Appropriateness Criteria® Chronic Wrist Pain  document were published from 
1989 to 2014.  
Although there are references that report on studies with design limitations, 19 well -designed or good- quality 
studies provide good evidence.
