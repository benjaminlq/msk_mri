Fr om 1998 to 2011, there was \nan adjusted annual increase of approximately 8% in thor acolumbar spine fractures in patients involved in motor \nvehicle collisions [15]. Thoracolumbar fractures are cha llenging to identify clinically, with only 48% to 75% of \nthoracolumbar injuries identified on clinical examination [16-18]. Unlike cervical injuries, well-defined clinical \ncriteria have not been established to determine when thor acolumbar imaging is appropriate in the setting of blunt \ntraumatic injury. Since clinical examination has poor sen sitivity for identifying thoracolumbar injuries, any high-\nrisk patient (mid line thoracolumbar tenderness, high-energ y mechanism of injury, or >60 years of age), as well as \nunexaminable patients (intoxicated, GCS <15, distracting injury), should undergo imaging of the thoracolumbar \nspine. Screening of the entire spine is advised, as an es timated 20% of spine injuries will have a second associated \nspinal injury at a noncontiguous level [26,27]. \nRadiography  Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nIt is well established that CT outperforms radiographs in  the diagnosis of thoracolumbar spine fractures [104-\n108].

Ho wever, as with conventional CT, CT \nmyelography is inferior to MRI in assessing cord contus ion, cord hemorrhage, and postganglionic nerve root \ninjuries [40,41,43,57].

Additionally, unlike the case \nfor the knee and other larger joints, MRI shows only fair sensitivity for depicting articular cartilage defects in the \ndistal radius and carpal bones, even with the use of indirect MR ar thrography or 3.0 T scanners [59,60]. The \npresence of focal bone marrow edema may be a clue to underl ying chondral defects [59]. Despite these \nlimitations, noncontrast MRI and noncontrast CT are both usually appropriate exam ination s to evaluate potential \nsequelae of chronic scaphoid fractures, but only one of the tests needs to be performed for a given patient. The use \nof IV contrast for MR I may be appropriate in some cases.  \nMR Arthrography  Wrist  \nA single study found that direct MR arthrography was more sensitive for articular cartilage defects compared to \nconventional MRI, but the same study showed that CT arthrography was even more sensitive [38].
