A later study by  Rubin et al [51] comparing bone scan s and \nMRI demonstrated i mproved sensitivity and specificity of MRI relative to bone scans . Moreover, t he bone scan \ngroup averaged an additional day to surgery.  \nBone scintigraphy is a time-consuming process.

Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type \nresult in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men \n[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs \nwill continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of \nlife following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays \nin diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -\nand long-term mortality [6-13]. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of hip fractures is critical. Hip fractures \ncannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded on the basis of physical exam ination  alone ; therefore , imaging plays a \nkey role in early  and accurate diagnosis [14] .", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "ACR acute hip pain suspected fracture.pdf", "mode": "text", "condition": "ACR acute hip pain suspected fracture"}, "score": 0.3238908052444458}, {"page_content": "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 6 Acute Hip Pain -Suspected Fracture  Bone Scan H ips \nPrior to the advent of MRI, a bone scan was the preferred test for radiographically occult proximal femoral \nfractures. However, as early as 1993 , Rizzo et al [50] demonstrated MRI to be at least as accurate as bone scan s \nand with substantially decreased time to diagnosis. A later study by  Rubin et al [51] comparing bone scan s and \nMRI demonstrated i mproved sensitivity and specificity of MRI relative to bone scans . Moreover, t he bone scan \ngroup averaged an additional day to surgery.  \nBone scintigraphy is a time-consuming process. Bone scans may be falsely negative for up to 72 hours from the \ntime of in jury, and false-positive scans are likewise common, related to osteoarthritis, soft -tissue injury , or any \nother process that may increase bone turnover [50] . It has been postulated that performing single -photon emission \ncomputed tomography may combine the sensitivity of bone scintig raphy with the spatial accuracy of CT , but there \nare no data to support this view. In current practice, the role of bone scan s as a secondary line of imaging in \npatients with contraindications to MRI has largely been usurped by CT.  \nSummary of Recommendations \n\u2022 Variant 1:  Radiographs  of the hip, radiographs  of the pelvis, or radiographs  of the pelvis and hips is usually \nappropriate for the initial imaging of the hip with acute pain, fall or minor trauma, and suspected fracture.  \n\u2022 Variant 2:  MRI pelv is and affected hip without IV contrast  or CT pelvis and hips without IV contrast is \nusually appropriate as the next imaging study for the evaluation of a cute hip pain from a fall or minor trauma  \nwith negative radiographs  and suspected fracture.  \nSupporting  Documents  \nThe evidence table, literature search, and appendix for this topic are available at https://acsearch.acr.org/list .

A wide variety  of pathological  entities  may cause hip pain, \nincluding  osseous  as well as intra- or extra -articular  soft tissue abnormalities  [5-7]. Pathology  involving  the lumbar  \nspine,  sacroiliac,  or knee  joints  can also cause hip pain [8], and these  etiologies  should  be investigated  as needed . \nThere is limited  original  research  that specifically  targets the imaging  of chronic  hip pain,  but imaging  of specific  \nconditions  is widely  discussed  in the published  literature. \nBefore  imaging,  an appropriate  assessment  of a patient\u2019s  clinical  history  and physical  examination  is essential  in \ntrying  to pare down the range  of possible etiologies  for a patient\u2019s  symptoms.", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "ACR chronic hip pain.pdf", "mode": "text", "condition": "ACR chronic hip pain"}, "score": 0.3183838725090027}, {"page_content": "A new inability to bear weight is a \nclinically suspicious finding , although the sensitivity and specificity of this is unknown  [20].

Risk \nfactors for radiographically occult fracture in these studies included those age >65, low -force trauma,  such as a \nground-level fall , and female gender. These studies have almost exclusively included elderly patients.  There is no \nrelevant literature regarding the sensitivity and specificity of radiographs in the younger patient population,  and \nclinicians are suggested to proceed with caution.  \nRadiography Pelvis  \nThere is no specific literature  regarding the use of an AP view of the pelvis  alone  for acute hip pain following \nlow-force trauma.  Previous literature regarding the accuracy of radiography has almost exclusively evaluated AP \nand cross-table lateral radiographs of the hip or the combined use of AP pelvis and hip radiographs. However, i t is \nwell established that patients with clinically  suspected proximal femur fracture often have fractures of the pelvis,  \nincluding the sacrum and pubic rami [21,27-30] . Therefore , it has been  recommended that the radiographic series \ninclude the AP view of the pelvis along with the orthogonal  views  of the symptomatic hip [31] . The inclusion of a \npelvis radiograph also allows for comparison of potential abnormalities to the contralateral asymptomatic side.  \nPelvis radiographs share the same limitations in sensitivity  and specificity  for fracture detection as hip \nradiographs , and a negative radiograph alone cannot exclude fracture . \nRadiography Pelvis and Hip \nAs previously discussed, p atients with clinically suspected proximal femur fracture often have fractures of the \npelvis  that includ e the sacrum and pubic rami [21,27- 30].

Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and \nit can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain \nwith the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. \nTypically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain \npersists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  \nimaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated \nthat approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the \nprior year) radiographs [2 ]. \nThis document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  \u22655 years of age.", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "ACR chronic knee pain.pdf", "mode": "text", "condition": "ACR chronic knee pain"}, "score": 0.318256139755249}, {"page_content": "Patellofemoral car tilage loss is also associated with chronic knee pain , with active knee pain correlated with \nBMLs [30,31].

Chronic ankle  pain can be caused by a variety \nof osseous or soft -tissue abnormalities, either alone or in combination. For assessing chronic ankle pain, there are \nmultiple imaging options, including radiography, stress radiography,  computed tomography (CT)  radionuclide \nbone scanning, ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and various injection procedures. Injection \nproce dures include arthrography, CT arthrography, MR arthrography, and diagnostic injection with anesthetic \nagents. Although there are numerous causes for chronic ankle pain, common etiologies include osteoarthritis, \nosteochondral injury, tendon abnormalities, ligament abnormalities and instability, and impingement.  \nOverview of Imaging Modalities  \nRadiography Radiographs can provide information about the osseous and soft -tissue structures about the ankle.

Chronic ankle  pain can be caused by a variety \nof osseous or soft -tissue abnormalities, either alone or in combination. For assessing chronic ankle pain, there are \nmultiple imaging options, including radiography, stress radiography,  computed tomography (CT)  radionuclide \nbone scanning, ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and various injection procedures. Injection \nproce dures include arthrography, CT arthrography, MR arthrography, and diagnostic injection with anesthetic \nagents. Although there are numerous causes for chronic ankle pain, common etiologies include osteoarthritis, \nosteochondral injury, tendon abnormalities, ligament abnormalities and instability, and impingement.  \nOverview of Imaging Modalities  \nRadiography Radiographs can provide information about the osseous and soft -tissue structures about the ankle.

Because of these limitations, \narthrography  has now largely been supplanted by cross-sectional imaging. Fluoroscopic -guided intra -articular \ninjections are chiefly used as a first step when performing arthrographic  computed tomography ( CT) and \nmagnetic resonance imaging (MR I) studies [8]. \nMRI  \nWrist MRI accurately depicts abnormalities of the bones and bone marrow, articular cartilage, intrinsic and \nextrinsic ligaments, TFCC, synovium, tendons, and neurovascular structures, making it a powerful study for \nchronic pai n caused by diverse etiologies.  \nA dedicated receiver coil or transmit -receive coil is necessary to provide the signal -to-noise ratio needed for high-\nresolution, high-contrast MRI of the wrist [9 ]. MR arthrography \u2014either with direct contrast injection into one  or \nmore wrist compartments or performed indirectly after intravenous (IV) contrast administration \u2014can enhance the \nyield of the study for diagnosing internal wrist derangements, especially abnormalities of the ligaments, articular cartilage, and TFCC of the wrist.

Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a \nsignificant improvement in health-related quality of life with effective treatment of foot pain [3] . Estimating the \nprevalence of chron ic foot pain is challenging, because there is no consensus regarding the definition of chronic \npain in the literature. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines chronic pain as any pain persisting \npast the normal healing time, suggesting 3 months in case of chronic pain of benign causes.  \nWomen are more commonly affected , and forefoot conditions are more frequent. Persistent pain for more than 6  \nyears has been reported in 51% of women between 70 to 75 years of age [4]. Because of  the wide range of causes \nof chronic foot pain, assessment of these patients with imaging studies in addition to a dedicated clinical \nexamination is often needed [1] .", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "ACR chronic foot pain.pdf", "mode": "text", "condition": "ACR chronic foot pain"}, "score": 0.37776613235473633}], "appropriateness": "USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE", "recommendation": "Ultrasound (US) of the area of interest or a CT of the area of interest without IV contrast"}, {"question": "Patient Profile: 55 year old Philipino female.

Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a \nsignificant improvement in health-related quality of life with effective treatment of foot pain [3] . Estimating the \nprevalence of chron ic foot pain is challenging, because there is no consensus regarding the definition of chronic \npain in the literature. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines chronic pain as any pain persisting \npast the normal healing time, suggesting 3 months in case of chronic pain of benign causes.  \nWomen are more commonly affected , and forefoot conditions are more frequent. Persistent pain for more than 6  \nyears has been reported in 51% of women between 70 to 75 years of age [4]. Because of  the wide range of causes \nof chronic foot pain, assessment of these patients with imaging studies in addition to a dedicated clinical \nexamination is often needed [1] .", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "ACR chronic foot pain.pdf", "mode": "text", "condition": "ACR chronic foot pain"}, "score": 0.34522199630737305}, {"page_content": "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 4 Chronic Foot Pain  Discussion of Procedures by Variant  \nVariant 1: Chronic foot pain.

Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral \nand oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11].

The choice of imaging modality depends on the patient\u2019s \npresentation and the clinical questions being asked. There are scenarios in which no imaging beyond baseline \nradiographs is necessary, but in other situations advanced imaging has added value for diagnostic eva luation and \ntreatment planning.  \nOverview of Imaging Modalities  \nRadiographs  \nImaging evaluation of the painful wrist should begin with radiog raphs [1,2]. This simple study may establish a \nspecific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, \nimpaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -\nanterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or \nmore oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling \n[3]. A v ariety of stress positions and maneuvers can be performed to elicit dynamic instability that is not visible \non standard radiographs [ 4]. Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. \nAdditionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ].", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "ACR chronic hand and wrist pain.pdf", "mode": "text", "condition": "ACR chronic hand and wrist pain"}, "score": 0.3241577744483948}, {"page_content": "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 16 Chronic Wrist Pain  Arthrography  Wrist  \nOnce a scaphoid fracture is identified, Radiographic arthrography does not contribute to the evaluation for \ncomplications of the fracture.  \nVariant 12: Chronic wrist pain.

The choice of imaging modality depends on the patient\u2019s \npresentation and the clinical questions being asked. There are scenarios in which no imaging beyond baseline \nradiographs is necessary, but in other situations advanced imaging has added value for diagnostic eva luation and \ntreatment planning.  \nOverview of Imaging Modalities  \nRadiographs  \nImaging evaluation of the painful wrist should begin with radiog raphs [1,2]. This simple study may establish a \nspecific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, \nimpaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -\nanterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or \nmore oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling \n[3]. A v ariety of stress positions and maneuvers can be performed to elicit dynamic instability that is not visible \non standard radiographs [ 4]. Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. \nAdditionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ].", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "ACR chronic hand and wrist pain.pdf", "mode": "text", "condition": "ACR chronic hand and wrist pain"}, "score": 0.3399334251880646}, {"page_content": "Furthermore, conventional \narthrography is unable to show extra -articular findings (like ganglion cysts and tendon disorders) that can cause \nradial -sided pain, further limiting its usefulness in  this patient population . \nBone Scan  Wrist  \nBone scan is not routinely used to further evaluate radial -sided chronic wrist pain when radiographs are normal or \nnonspecific.", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "ACR chronic hand and wrist pain.pdf", "mode": "text", "condition": "ACR chronic hand and wrist pain"}, "score": 0.3284786343574524}, {"page_content": "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 11 Chronic Wrist Pain  CT Wrist  \nWhile CT with IV contrast enhancement can depict abscesses, it is usually not appropriate  for evaluation of \nsuspected wrist infections.  \nCT Arthrography  Wrist  \nCT arthrography is not routinely used to eval uate suspected wrist infection.  \nUS Wrist  \nThere may be a role for US in the staging of infections (for example, to delineate the location and e xtent of soft -\ntissue abscesses) after aspiration has been performed.

Imaging  can help to guide  appropriate  therapy , which  can range  from  conservative  \nmeasures such as physical  therapy  and cortico steroid  injections  to more  invasive  procedures  such as arthroscopy or \nsurgery .

In \nacute infection,  findings  such as pain,  swelling,  warmth,  erythema,  and fever  are common,  whereas chronic  \ninfections  may be manifested  by pain alone  [44]. Night  pain or pain at rest is characteristic of infection, whereas  \npain on weightbearing  is more  characteristic of mechanical  loosening.  Some  authors  suggest  that infection  needs to \nbe excluded  in all patients  with pain persisting  >6 months  after joint replacement  [18]. \nLaboratory findings  in the setting  of TKA infection  are often  nonspecific.  Peripheral  leukocyte  counts  are not \nelevated  in most  patients  with infected  prostheses.  Erythrocyte  sedimentation  rates (ESRs) are abnormal  in patients  \nwith infection, but this finding  may also be seen in uninfected  patients,  limiting  the usefulness of the test [48]. A \nretrospective review of 68 patients  undergoing hip and knee  revision  surgery  indicated  that C-reactive protein  (CRP)  \nwas significantly  higher  in patients  with infection  compared  with those  with loosening (sensitivity  of 79% for all \nprostheses) ; however , a normal  CRP  level  did not exclude  infection  [49].", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "ACR imaging after total knee arthroplasty.pdf", "mode": "text", "condition": "ACR imaging after total knee arthroplasty"}, "score": 0.3163246512413025}], "appropriateness": "MAY BE APPROPRIATE", "recommendation": "Image-guided aspiration knee"}, {"question": "Patient Profile: 11 year old Chinese male.

Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and \nit can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain \nwith the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. \nTypically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain \npersists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  \nimaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated \nthat approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the \nprior year) radiographs [2 ]. \nThis document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  \u22655 years of age.", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "ACR chronic knee pain.pdf", "mode": "text", "condition": "ACR chronic knee pain"}, "score": 0.32332420349121094}, {"page_content": "MR Arthrography  Knee  \nMR arthrography is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with s igns of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  \nUS Knee  \nUS is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  \nBone Scan Knee  \nRadionuclide bone scan is usually not indicated to evaluate patients with signs of prior  (chronic) osseous knee \ninjury.  \nImage -Guided Aspiration Knee  \nJoint aspiration is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  \nSummary of Recommendations  \n\u2022 Variant 1:  Radiographs  of the knee  are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of  chronic knee pain in \npatients greater than or equal to 5 years of age.  \n\u2022 Variant 2:  MRI knee without  IV contrast is usually appropriate in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of \nage with chronic knee pain when initial knee  radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion.  \n\u2022 Variant 3:  MRI knee without  IV contrast is usually appropriate  in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of \nage with chronic knee pain when initial knee radiographs demonstrate OCD,  loose bodies, or history of \ncartilage or meniscal repair.  \n\u2022 Variant 4:  (1) MRI knee without IV contrast  or (2)  knee aspiration or (3)  CT knee without  IV contrast may \nbe appropriate  in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of age with chronic knee pain when initial \nradiographs de monstrate degenerative changes or chondrocalcinosis.

MRI is extremely sensitive and demonstrates stress abnormalities \nas early as bone scintigraphy and with as much sensitivity [ 11-14]. The recent literature favors MRI as the \nprocedure of choice for making an early diagnosis of both varieties of stress fractures [ 15-28 ]. MRI is also \nconsiderably more specifi c than bone scintigraphy [ 19,23]. Stress injuries in athletes that are not identified and \nmanaged in a timel y fashion can progress to more serious fractures. Preventive strategies, including identifying \nand modifying risk factors, may help deter progression to frank fractures [31,44,45]. \nA circumstance that deserves specific attention is the longitudinal stress fracture, particularly in the tibia. Up to \n25% may appear n ormal on radiographs, but CT or MRI findings are characteristic [ 13,46].", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "ACR stress fracture including sacrum.pdf", "mode": "text", "condition": "ACR stress fracture including sacrum"}, "score": 0.3377871513366699}, {"page_content": "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 10 Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture  Variant 5: Confirmed stress (fatigue) fracture, excluding vertebrae .

On initial diagnosis, MRI can be used to  predict t ime to return to play in athletes. \nFredericson et al  [48] retrospectively correlated return to activity with an MRI grading system based on the \npattern of periosteal and marrow edema on T1-weighted  and fat -suppressed T 2-weighted sequences. Similar \nfindings were confirmed in other studies  [49-51] , including  that the finding of abnormal cortical signal intensity \nor a fracture line was of prognostic value [ 51] and that MRI performed better in predicting return to activity than \nradiographs , bone scintigraphy, or CT [50,52]. \nA recent prospective study in university athletes found that MRI grading s everity, total-body bone mineral density \nevaluated by dual -energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and location of injury (ie , cortical or trabecular bone)  \nwere important variables for predicting time to full return to sport [ 31]. In this study, periosteal edema as \ndescribed by Fredericson et al [ 48] was not associated with return to sport . Using the modified grading scale and a \nmultiple regression model, for every 1- unit increase in MRI grade, the time to full return to sport increased by \napproximately 48 days [31] . Furthermore, trabecular st ress injuries (eg , femur neck and pubic bone ) were \nassociated with a longer time to return to sport than cortical bone stress injuries. In addition, decreased bone \nmineral density leads to increased time to return to sport . Therefore, bone mineral density provides additional \ndiagnostic and prognostic information [31]. The model of MRI  grade, trabecular versus cortical bone sit e, and \ntotal-body bone mineral density a ccounted for 68% of the variation in time to return to sport [ 31].", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "ACR stress fracture including sacrum.pdf", "mode": "text", "condition": "ACR stress fracture including sacrum"}, "score": 0.3182523250579834}], "appropriateness": "USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE", "recommendation": "MRI of the area of interest (right tibia) without IV contrast"}, {"question": "Patient Profile: 69 year old Chinese male.

Fr om 1998 to 2011, there was \nan adjusted annual increase of approximately 8% in thor acolumbar spine fractures in patients involved in motor \nvehicle collisions [15].

Unlike cervical injuries, well-defined clinical \ncriteria have not been established to determine when thor acolumbar imaging is appropriate in the setting of blunt \ntraumatic injury.

Screening of the entire spine is advised, as an es timated 20% of spine injuries will have a second associated \nspinal injury at a noncontiguous level [26,27]. \nRadiography  Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nIt is well established that CT outperforms radiographs in  the diagnosis of thoracolumbar spine fractures [104-\n108]. Radiographs have a reported sens itivity of 49% to 62% for identifying thoracic spine fractures and 67% to \n82% sensitivity for identifying lumbar spine fractures [ 104,107,108] compared with the reported sensitivity of \n94% to 100% for identifying thoracolumbar spine fract ures using CT [104,107,108].", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "ACR suspected spine trauma.pdf", "mode": "text", "condition": "ACR suspected spine trauma"}, "score": 0.3133271634578705}, {"page_content": "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 18 Suspected Spine Trauma Variant 10: Age greater than or equal to 16 years.

Overall \nsensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs \nin the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral \nand oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar \ncoalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs \non the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have \nbeen found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable \nmethods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  \nRadiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture.
