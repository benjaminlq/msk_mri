Car hit road divider.  On examintion, patient is alert, but power in bilateral lower limbs is 2 out of 5.  Slightly lax anal tone on digital rectal examination.  X-rays show T12 chance fracture.  MRI thoracic and lumbar spine without IV contrast to assess for neurologic injury.  ","MRI thoracic and lumbar spine without IV
contrast ",L,UA,"1. Classification of appropriateness for the ordered scan: USUALLY APPROPRIATE
2. Explanation for the appropriateness classification: The patient is over 16 years old and has a thoracic spine injury detected on radiographs. He also presents with neurologic abnormalities, specifically reduced power in the lower limbs and slightly lax anal tone. According to the provided context, an MRI thoracic and lumbar spine without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for such patients.
3. If classification answer is USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE, either recommend an alternative appropriate scan procedure or return NO SCAN REQUIRED: Not applicable as the ordered scan is usually appropriate.",UA,
2,"48 year old Indian male.  CEO of shipping company.  Recreational cricket player.  Prior history of fatty liver, hyperlipidemia on statins.   Now presenting with low back pain for 3 days post cricket match.  No radiation to groin or lower limbs.  Able to walk.  Urination and bowel motion are ok.  No fever.  On examination, straight leg raise test is positive.  Power in bilateral lower limbs is full.  Digital rectal examination shows good anal tone.  No prior imaging.  For MRI lumbar spine with IV contrast to assess for prolapsed intervertebral disc or muscle strain. ",MRI lumbar spine with IV contrast,L,UNA,"1. Classification of appropriateness for the ordered scan: USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE
2. Explanation for the appropriateness classification: The patient presents with low back pain without any signs of progressive neurologic deficit, multifocal deficit, or suspected Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES). The patient also does not have a history of prior lumbar surgery. According to the ACR Appropriateness Criteria, MRI lumbar spine with IV contrast is not typically performed independently as an initial study. Its interpretation is most informative when correlated with standard noncontrast sequences included in MRI lumbar spine with and without IV contrast. 
3. Recommended alternative scan procedure: MRI lumbar spine without IV contrast would be more appropriate as an initial imaging study in this case. This is because it is useful in the evaluation of suspected soft-tissue pathology, can assess vertebral marrow, and assess the spinal canal patency.",UNA,MRI lumbar spine without IV contrast
3,"73 year old Malay female.  Past history of cholecystectomy, fatty liver, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis of bilateral knees post bilateral total knee replacement.  Now presenting with low back pain for 6 days.  No radiation to groin or lower limbs.  No difficulty passing urine or bowel motion.  On examination, mild step deformity at L2 region.  Power full in bilateral lower limbs.  Good anal tone on digital rectal examination.  No prior imaging.  For MIR lumbar spine without IV contrast to further assess low back pain.",MRI lumbar spine without IV contrast,H,UA,"1. Classification of appropriateness for the ordered scan: USUALLY APPROPRIATE
2. Explanation for the appropriateness classification: The patient is an elderly individual with a history of osteoarthritis and is now presenting with low back pain. According to the ACR Appropriateness Criteria, an MRI lumbar spine without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the initial imaging for patients with low back pain, especially in the context of osteoporosis, elderly individuals, or chronic steroid use. The patient's symptoms and age align with these criteria, making the ordered MRI scan usually appropriate.
3. If classification answer is USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE, either recommend an alternative appropriate scan procedure or return NO SCAN REQUIRED: Not applicable as the ordered scan is usually appropriate.",UA,
4,"46 year old Caucasian female.  History of systemic lupus erythematosus on follow up with rheumatology.  Now presenting with 5 day history of worsening numbness and tingling in all 4 limbs, feels uncoordinated and more difficult to control continence.  On examination, reduced pinprick sensation in bilateral hands and feets, power in all 4 limbs is 3 to 4 out of 5.  Anal tone is equivocally lax.  No sensory level.  No prior imaging. For MRI whole spine without and with IV contrast to assess for myelopathy.","MRI spine area of interest without and with
IV contrast",L,UA,"1. Classification of appropriateness for the ordered scan: USUALLY APPROPRIATE
2. Explanation for the appropriateness classification: The patient presents with symptoms of progressive neurologic deficit, including numbness and tingling in all 4 limbs, reduced pinprick sensation, reduced power in all 4 limbs, and difficulty controlling continence. These symptoms suggest a possible condition of Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES) or myelopathy. According to the ACR Appropriateness Criteria, MRI lumbar spine without and with IV contrast is usually appropriate as the initial imaging of patients with suspected CES. This is due to its ability to accurately depict soft-tissue pathology, assess vertebral marrow, and assess the spinal canal patency. Therefore, the ordered MRI scan is appropriate for this patient.",UA,
5,"73 year old Indian male, with history of end stage diabetic nephropathy on haemodialysis. Complains of lower back pain for the past 2 months with occasional night pain. Associated with radicular pain of left lower limb. no fever. Physical exam reveals mild tenderness at L3-L4 region but otherwise unremarkable. No prior imaging. MRI lumbar spine without and with IV contrast for possible spondylodiscitis.","MRI spine area of interest without and with
IV contrast",L,UA,"1. Classification of appropriateness for the ordered scan: USUALLY APPROPRIATE
2. Explanation for the appropriateness classification: The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of end-stage diabetic nephropathy on haemodialysis. He presents with lower back pain for the past 2 months with occasional night pain, associated with radicular pain of the left lower limb. There is no fever, but physical exam reveals mild tenderness at the L3-L4 region. Given the patient's age, history of diabetes, and symptoms, there is a clinical suspicion of underlying infection such as spondylodiscitis. According to the ACR Appropriateness Criteria, MRI lumbar spine without and with IV contrast is usually appropriate for initial imaging in patients with low back pain with suspicion of cancer, infection, or immunosuppression. This patient falls into this category due to his immunosuppressed state from end-stage diabetic nephropathy and the suspicion of spondylodiscitis. Therefore, the ordered MRI scan is usually appropriate.",UA,
6,"70 year old malay male. History of diabetes, hyperlipidemia and hypertension. Worsening neck pain for past 6 months, no radiculopathy or night pain. No recent trauma. Clinical exam reveals mild midline tenderness over the cervical spine with limited range of motion, but no focal neurological deficit. MRI cervical spine without IV contrast for initial examination. ",MRI cervical spine with IV contrast,M,UNA,"1. Classification of appropriateness for the ordered scan: USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE
2. Explanation for the appropriateness classification: The patient's profile indicates chronic neck pain without recent trauma or radiculopathy. The context suggests that MRI cervical spine without IV contrast is the gold standard for imaging diagnosis of traumatic soft-tissue injuries of the neck. However, the patient has no recent trauma. The ordered scan, MRI cervical spine with IV contrast, is usually not appropriate as per the context provided. 
3. Recommended scan procedure: MRI cervical spine without IV contrast. This is the appropriate initial imaging study for this patient's condition as per the context provided.",UNA,MRI cervical spine without IV contrast
