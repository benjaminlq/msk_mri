Noncontrast CT is unable to assess rotator cuff pathology in the acute setting.  
US Shoulder  
In the post -traumatic setting, US  has been shown to detect abnormalities, including rotator cuff tears [ 25]. In 
general, US can have high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of full -thickness rotator cuff tears [ 70-72] . 
There is conflicting evidence on the ability of US  to diagnose partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [17,22,24,44,72]. 
Similarly, although interobserver agreement in detection of full -thickness rotator cuff tears can be high, it is much 
more variable for detection of partial -thickness tears [73,74]. 
FDG -PET/CT  Skull Base to Mid-Thigh 
FDG-PET/CT is not routinely used  for describing  rotator cuff tears.  Indirect identification of symptomatic rotator 
cuff tears has been described on FDG-PET/CT  by decreased radiotracer activity in the muscles of the torn tendons 
and increased activity of surrounding shoulder girdle muscles due to muscle recruitment  [28,29]. However, FDG-
PET/CT  cannot describe the extent of rotator cuff tear or degree of rotator cuff atrophy, which are relevant for 
clinical management.  
Bone Scan  Shoulder  
Bone scintigraphy is not routinely used  for describing rotator cuff tears . Increased radiotracer activity has been 
associated with symptomatic rotator cuff tears [33]. However, bone scintigraphy cannot describe the extent of 
rotator cuff tear or degree of rotator cuff atrophy, which are re levant for clinical management.

Variant 6: Traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs normal.  Physical examination and history consistent 
with dislocation event  or instability . Next imaging study. 
Shoulder dislocation or instability is most co mmon in the anterior direction. Younger patients are more likely to 
have labroligamentous injury and persistent instability after dislocation compared with older patients [54]. Older 
patients are more likely to have rotator cuff tears in association with shoulder dislocation [ 55]. Coexisting 
humeral avulsion of the glenohumeral ligament and significant glenoid bone loss have been found in up to 10% of 
patients with recurrent shoulder instability [ 56], which underscores the need to assess both osseous and 
labroligamentous pathology in patients with shoulder dislocation or instability. Glenoid morphology and bone 
loss can play a significant factor in recurrent shoulder dislocations [15, 16,57], which may require bone grafting in 
order to restore stability [ 57].

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Traumatic shoulder pain is shoulder pain believed to be directly attributed to a traumatic event, either acute or 
chronic. This pain may be the result of either fracture (the clavicle, scapula, or proximal humerus) or soft -tissue 
injury (most commonly of the rotator cuff, acromioclavicular ligaments, or labroligamentous complex). The 
incidence of traumatic shoulder injuries is difficult to determine because some injury types, such as low-grade 
acromioclavicular separations or acute rotator cuff tears, are likely under -reported because patients  do not seek 
immediate medical treatment. However, as with many traumatic injuries, traumatic shoulder pain tends to 
disproportionately involve young adults and male patients [ 1,2]. 
The etiology of traumatic shoulder pain can often be made based on clinical examination, radiographs, and 
mechanism of injury. Traumatic shoulder injuries can generally be separated into in juries requiring acute surgical 
management and injuries in which conservative management can be attempted prior to considering surgical 
treatment. Unstable or significantly displaced fractures and joint instability are injuries most likely requiring acute 
surgical treatment.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 8 Shoulder Pain –Traumatic  Variant 2: Traumatic shoulder pain. Nonlocalized shoulder pain. Negative radiographs . Next imaging 
study. 
Appropriately positioned  radiographs can exclude shoulder dislocation and most displaced fractures as the 
etiology for post -traumatic shoulder pain. In the setting of normal shoulder radiographs, the most common causes 
of post -traumatic shoulder pain are soft -tissue injuries such  as rotator cuff and labral tears.  
MRI Shoulder  
Noncontrast MRI is a reasonable imaging study in the setting of acute nonlocalized traumatic shoulder pain and 
noncontributory radiographs. In the acute trauma setting, noncontrast MRI may be preferred to MR arthrography , 
as acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint effusion for assessment of intra -articular 
soft-tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic 
pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [34,35]. MRI is also sensitive for diagnosing bone marrow 
contusion and has  been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries in pediatric patients [ 36,37]. 
MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography has been found to be superior to noncontrast MRI in the diagnosis of labroligamentous and 
partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [17,19]. In the acute trauma setting, however, noncontrast MRI may be 
preferred to MR arthrography because acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint 
effusion for assessment of intra-arti cular soft -tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing 
extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [ 34,35]. MRI is also sensitive 
for diagnosing bone marrow contusion and has been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries 
in pediatric patients [ 36,37].

Page Content: Most soft -tissue injuries (such as labral tears and rotator cuff tears) can undergo a period of 
conservative management prior to considering surgery. However, in addition to the specific imaging findings 
related to a traumatic injury, indications and timing of surgical treatment of many traumatic shoulder injuries are 
dependent on patient age, comorbidities, current activity level, and expected activity level.  
Imaging of chronic shoulder pain is beyond the scope of this topic  and is cove red in the  ACR Appropriateness

Discussion o f Procedures  by Variant  
Variant 1:  Traumatic shoulder pain. Any etiology . Initial imaging . 
Radiography Shoulder  
Radiographs are the preferred initial study performed in the setting of traumatic shoulder pain . They can delineate 
shoulder malalignment and most shoulder fractures [ 4,5]. A standard set of shoulder radiographs for trauma 
should include at least three  views: anterior -posterior (AP) views in internal and external rotation and an axillary 
or scapula-Y view. Axillary or scapula-Y views are vital in evaluating traumatic shoulder injuries as 
acromioclavicular and glenohumeral dislocations can be misclassified on AP  views [6,7]. Radiographs provide 
good delineation of bony anatomy to assess for fracture and appropriate shoulder alignment, which are the two 
primary concerns in management of acute traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs should also be performed upright 
since malalignment of the shoul der can be under -represented on supine radiographs [ 4]. Additional views, such as 
the Bernageau view, have been sho wn to be effective in demonstrating the degree of bone loss of the glenoid or 
humeral head [ 8].

specific inflammatory  and structural  lesions seen on CT and MRI resulting  in uncertain ty about  its diagnostic  utility  
[64,67- 72]. In one study,  the interreader  reliability  of diagnosing  sacroiliitis  on PET/CT was poor and substantially  
lower  than that for MRI or CT [67]. In a small  study using  radiographs  as the reference standard,  F-18-fluoride

Page Content: MRI Spine  Area  of Interest  
Although MRI  of the sacroiliac joints  has high utility  for the diagnosis  of axSpA,  some  patients  will not demonstrate  
imaging  features of axSpA  in the sacroiliac joints  on MRI as indicated  by sensitivities  of all studies to varying 
degrees below  100%  [22], and therefore  some  patients may need  further imaging  evaluation  with MRI given that it 
is the imaging  modality  of choice for the diagnosis  of axSpA  [1,3,19,22] . Studies  have  shown  widely varying  
degrees of isolated  spinal  involvement  on MRI in axSpA  ranging from  1% to 49% [19,59-63,114,115] . Therefore,  
imag ing of the spine  is beneficial  for patients  in whom  there is suspicion  for axSpA  but imaging  of the sacroiliac 
joints  has been  negative.  Some  authors  have  shown  the utility  of using  whole -spine  or whole -body  MRI to identify  
the burden of disease rather  than selecting  specific areas of the spine  to image  because findings  may be potentially  
isolated  to any portion of the spine  [10,59,63,89,114,120-122] . 
The spine  MRI  findings  of axSpA  include  the active inflammatory  changes of spondylitis  and spondylodiscitis,  the 
inflammatory  changes of the costovertebral  joints,  costotransverse joints,  and facet  joints  and areas of enthesitis  
along other  vertebral  ligamentous  attachments [123] . The chronic  structural  changes of fatty deposition,  erosions,

and prognosis  of their disease,  although radiographs  are more  typically  performed  to evaluate the spine  rather  than 
the sacroiliac  joints  [30]. This is because of  the low utility  of sacroiliac joint radiographs  for detecting  disease  
progression based  on the relatively  poor intra- and interreader  reliability  of interpretation  [141] . Radiographs  can 
demonstrate evolving  structural  changes or bone  formation,  although these changes occur  slowly  over time at the 
sacroiliac joints, often  requiring  years to detect  a change and prompting many  authors  to suggest  a radiographic  
imaging  interval  of axSpA  patients  of no less than 2 years for assessment  of disease progression [141- 146]. There 
is evidence that patients  on TNF -inhibitors  may have  slower  progression of structural  damage at the sacroiliac joints  
[147,148] , although there is some  disagreement  in the literature  [149] .

CT is the modality of choice for evaluating distal  radioulnar joint stability [54]. The CT protocol should include 
imaging of both wrists in maximal pronation, neutral position, and maximal supination.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Hand injuries account for approximately 20% of emergency department visits [ 1]. According to the National 
Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey , 1.5% of all emergency department visits involve  hand and wrist 
fractu res. Distal radius fractures are especially common, accounting for up to 18% of fractures in the elderly [ 2,3]. 
Because of increasing rates of osteoporosis, the incidence of distal radius fractures has been increasing [ 4]. 
Although most distal radius fractures in e lderly patients are managed non operatively, the use of internal fixation is 
increasing. Internal fixation has a much higher cost than nonopera tive treatment as well as increased rates of 
hospitalization [5]. 
For most patients with trauma to the hand and wrist, conventional radiographs provide sufficient diagnostic 
information to guide the treating physician.  However, delayed diagnosis is common because distal radius and 
scaphoid fractures may be radiographically occult  [6]. When initial radiographs  are normal but there is high 
clinical suspicion for fracture, further imaging with additional radiographic pr ojections, CT, or MRI  is 
appropriate .

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 6 Acute Hand and Wrist Trauma  Like CT, MRI shows intra -articular extension of distal radius fractures more frequently than radiography.  Unlike 
CT, MRI shows concomitant ligament  injuries, including tears of the scapholunate ligament, which may affect 
surgical treatment [26,27]. Despite these advantages,  MRI performed immediately at the time of injury has little 
added value for determining which patients go on to surgery [ 23]. 
MRI is especially useful in evaluating  hand soft -tissues injuries, including the collateral ligaments, volar plates, 
tendons, and pulleys. For metacarpal and digital fractures, MRI is usually not indicated during acute injury [ 22]. 
There is no evidence to support the use of MRI with IV contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist trauma.  
US Area of Interest  
US may have a limited utility  for evaluating bone injuries. Christiansen et al  [28] reported 47% sensitivity and 
61% specificity of US  for the detection of scaphoid fractures . They concluded that US  is not suitable for the early 
diagnosis of scaphoid fracture.  In contrast, Hauger et al  [29] reported that using cortical disruption as a diagnostic 
criterion on US is an accurate sign for detecting occult fractures of the scaphoid waist. Further study of US  for the 
diagnosis of occult fractures is needed . 
Bone Scan Area of  Interest  
Bone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  
Variant 3: Acute wrist fracture on radiographs. Suspect wrist tendon or ligament trauma. Next imaging

Radiography Wrist  
Assessment of carpal instability with conventional radiographs requires careful attention to radiographic 
positioning.  In low -grade injuries, radiographs are usually normal.  Scapholunate diastasis of >4 mm and dorsal til t 
of the lunate of > 10° suggests dorsal intercalated segmental instability  [30,31].

Radiograph y Area of Interest  
In patients with clinical suspicion of hand or wrist fracture and negative radiographs, one option is to place the 
patient in a short arm cast and repeat the radiographs at 10  to 14 days [ 13]. The downside of this option is that it 
results in delay of diagnosis , which may lead to functional impairment . 
CT Area of Interest  
When the initial radiographs are equivocal, CT  without IV contrast  is commonly used to exclude or confirm 
suspected wrist fractures [18]. CT shows intra-articular extension of distal radius fractures more frequently than 
radiography.  Three-dimensional reconstructions can be particularly helpful in preoperative planning for complex 
articular injuries  [7,8]. 
CT should be used to exclude an occult fracture of the upper extremity. Unlike MRI, CT cannot evaluate for 
concomitant ligamentous injuries  [19-21 ]. 
CT is useful in diagnosing injuries that are difficult to recognize on radiographs, such as carpometacarpal joint 
fracture dislocations. For metacarpal and digital  fractures, CT is usually not indicated during acute injury [ 22]. 
There is no evidence to support the use of CT with IV contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist trauma.  
MRI Area o f Interest  
When initial radiographs are normal but there is high clinical suspicion for fracture, MRI without IV contrast can 
detect fractures of the distal radius and carpal bones [12,23-25] . One study of patients in which the radiographic 
findings did not explain the clinical symptoms reported that the MRI led to a change in diagnosis in 55% of 
patients and a change in patient management in 66%  [12]. However, another study of patients with acutely injured 
wrists reported that the MRI did not predict the need for treatment better than the combination of physical 
examination and radiography [ 23]. More importantly, there was no difference in outcomes  with MRI compared 
with radiography [24].",False

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
In patients with chronic wrist pain, imaging studies are  an important adjunct to history, physical examination, 
laboratory testing, and electrophysiology studies. The choice of imaging modality depends on the patient’s 
presentation and the clinical questions being asked. There are scenarios in which no imaging beyond baseline 
radiographs is necessary, but in other situations advanced imaging has added value for diagnostic eva luation and 
treatment planning.  
Overview of Imaging Modalities  
Radiographs  
Imaging evaluation of the painful wrist should begin with radiog raphs [1,2]. This simple study may establish a 
specific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, 
impaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -
anterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or 
more oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling 
[3]. A v ariety of stress positions and maneuvers can be performed to elicit dynamic instability that is not visible 
on standard radiographs [ 4]. Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. 
Additionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ].

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 5 Acute Hand and Wrist Trauma  Most fractures of the thumb are visible on a 2-view radiographic examination, although there is a slight increase 
in dia gnostic yield with the addition of an oblique projection [ 13], which can be obtained along with a PA 
examination of the whole hand.  
In patients with suspected finger tendon injuries, radiographs are used to detect fracture fragments, as large 
fragments may require open reduction and internal fixation.  Radiographs are usually sufficient for  the evaluation 
of osseous “mallet” injuries, which include bony avulsion at the insertion of the extensor mechanism of the finger 
to the distal interphalangeal joint [16]. In these injuries, involvement of more than one -third of the articular 
surface usually requires operative fixation.  Palmar displacement of the distal phalanx or an interfragmentary gap 
of >3 mm is also an indication for surgery [ 16]. With extensor tendon injuries, radiographs are commonly used to 
assess for bone involve ment and determine need for operative fixation [ 17]. 
CT Area of Interest  
In patients with intra -articular fractures seen on radiography , CT shows articular fracture fragment displacement, 
depression, and comminution more accurately than conventional radiographs [ 7,9,10]. CT measurements of 
articular surface gap and step -off are more reproducible than radiographs [7]. The addition of 3- D surface -
rendered reconstructions to the standard 2 -D CT images has been shown to change operative management in up to 
48% of intra -articular distal radius fractures [8]. 
There is no evidence to support the use of CT with intravenous  (IV) contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist 
trauma.  
MRI Area of Interest  
MRI is not indicated initially in this clinical setting. 
US Area of Interest  
US is not indicated initially in this clinical setting.

Page Content: If associated soft -tissue injury is clinically suspected, CT, CT arthrography, MR I, MR arthrography, 
or ultrasound (US) may be indicated  [7-10]. 
Successful treatment of distal radius fractures requires restoration of radial length, inclination, and tilt, as well as 
the realignment of the articular fracture fragments [9,11]. The presence of a coronally  oriented fracture line, die -
punch depression, or more than three articular fracture fragments are common indications for operative reduction 
[8]. Operative fixation resulting in < 2 mm of residual articular surface step-off is usually considered necessary to 
avoid long-term complications , such as osteoarthritis [9 ,12]. 
Discussion of Procedures by Variant  
Variant 1: Acute blunt or penetrating trauma to the hand or wrist. Initial imaging.  
Radiograph y Area of Interest  
Radiography is  always indicated as the initial imaging for suspected acute hand and wrist trauma.  For m ost joints 
of the extremities, especially those involving the wrist, hand, and fingers, a radiographic examination that 
includes only 2 views is not adequate for detecting fractures [13]. For patients with suspected  distal radius 
fractures, a 3-view examination  of the wrist  usually includes a posteroanterior (PA) , a lateral, and a 45° 
semi pronated oblique view  [11]. One study [ 14] reports that a fourth projection—a semisupinated oblique —
increases diagnostic yield for distal radius fractures.  
A standard 3 -view radiographic examination of the hand shows most fractures and dislocations of the metacarpals 
and phalanges [ 13]. For phalangeal injuries, some centers include a PA examination of the entire hand, whereas 
others limit the examination to the injured finger.

MRI is ideal for evaluating tendon injuries and helping with surgical planning [58, 59]. MRI is comm only used for 
the diagnosis of  Stener lesions of the thumb [60] and the diagnosis of pulley system injuries [61]. 
Hergan et al [62] reported a 100% sensitivity and specificity for assessment of thumb ulnar collateral ligament 
tears. Spaeth et al [ 63] reported a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 94% for detection of displaced ulnar 
collateral ligament tears in 16 cadaveric specimens.  
US Hand  
A Stener lesion occurs when the aponeurosis of the adductor pollicis muscle becomes interposed between the 
ruptured ulnar collateral ligament of the thumb and its site  of insertion at the base of the proximal phalanx. This 
lesion can be identified by absence of ulnar collateral ligament and the presence of a hypoechoic mass proximal to 
the apex of the metacarpal tubercle [64]. Dynamic examination shows the relationship of the aponeurosis to the 
retracted ligament stump [65] . 
US allows for diagnosis of pulley system injuries [ 66,67]. 
Bone Scan Hand 
Bone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.

Page Content: The biomechanics of proximal femoral and pelvic fractures that are a result of major trauma differs as these 
injuries may be seen in any age group, often with additional accompanying high-velocity injuri es of the abdomen 
and pelvis . Motor vehicle –related trauma is the most common  mechanism. Thorough evaluation of the hip may be 
superseded  in these instances by the need for resuscitation and diagnosis and treatment of more urgent associated 
vascular or solid organ injuries. Imaging plays an important role not only in the diagnosis of high-velocity 
fractures but also in characterizing fracture mechanism and morphology for treatment planning purposes.  
However, imaging of high-velocity hip fractures occurs in the context of a broader trauma evaluation. A full 
discussion of the broader imaging workup of blunt trauma is beyond the scope of this paper and will be covered in 
the upcoming ACR Appropriateness Criteria® titled “Major Blunt Trauma” and will be made available on the 
ACR website  when completed . 
Treatment  for both intra - and extracapsular proximal femoral fractures in the elderly is typically surgical fixation  
because of the risk of further fracture displacement and the dangers of prolonged immobilization in the elderly 
[15]. Joint replacement may be  performed for displaced fractures of the femoral neck where the risk of femoral 
head avascular necrosis is high. Fractures from high -force trauma are also commonly treated with surgical 
fixation for stability to reduce the risk of post -traumatic osteo arthritis. 
Discussion of Procedures by Variant  
Variant 1:  Acute hip pain. Fall or minor trauma. Suspect fracture. Initial imaging.  
Radiography Hip 
Radiography is the initial imaging modality of choice for assessment of acute hip pain with suspected fracture , 
with the more advanced imaging modalities reserved for instances of clinically suspected fracture in the setting of 
negative or equivocal radiographs. Radiographs are rapidly obtained and well tolerated by patients. When a 
fracture is demonstrated , freque ntly no more imaging is needed for treatment planning purposes [15 -17].

US Hip 
The use of US  for evaluation of the acutely painful hip has been evaluated in a single study of 10 patients  with hip 
fractures [36]. Although US was able to identify trauma-related changes,  such as joint effusion , with 100% 
sensitivity , specificity for fracture reached only 65%. The authors acknowledged that performance might further 
decrease for examinations performed by sonographers and radiologists not experienced with musculoskeletal US . 
For this document , it is assumed the procedure is performed and interpreted by an expert.  Given the inability of 
US to comprehensively evaluate the bones and soft  tissues of the pelvis, there is not enough evidence to support 
the role of US  in the workup of radiographically occult hip fracture.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 6 Acute Hip Pain -Suspected Fracture  Bone Scan H ips 
Prior to the advent of MRI, a bone scan was the preferred test for radiographically occult proximal femoral 
fractures. However, as early as 1993 , Rizzo et al [50] demonstrated MRI to be at least as accurate as bone scan s 
and with substantially decreased time to diagnosis. A later study by  Rubin et al [51] comparing bone scan s and 
MRI demonstrated i mproved sensitivity and specificity of MRI relative to bone scans . Moreover, t he bone scan 
group averaged an additional day to surgery.  
Bone scintigraphy is a time-consuming process. Bone scans may be falsely negative for up to 72 hours from the 
time of in jury, and false-positive scans are likewise common, related to osteoarthritis, soft -tissue injury , or any 
other process that may increase bone turnover [50] . It has been postulated that performing single -photon emission 
computed tomography may combine the sensitivity of bone scintig raphy with the spatial accuracy of CT , but there 
are no data to support this view. In current practice, the role of bone scan s as a secondary line of imaging in 
patients with contraindications to MRI has largely been usurped by CT.  
Summary of Recommendations 
• Variant 1:  Radiographs  of the hip, radiographs  of the pelvis, or radiographs  of the pelvis and hips is usually 
appropriate for the initial imaging of the hip with acute pain, fall or minor trauma, and suspected fracture.  
• Variant 2:  MRI pelv is and affected hip without IV contrast  or CT pelvis and hips without IV contrast is 
usually appropriate as the next imaging study for the evaluation of a cute hip pain from a fall or minor trauma  
with negative radiographs  and suspected fracture.

Pelvis radiographs share the same limitations in sensitivity  and specificity  for fracture detection as hip

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Fractures of the proximal femur (commonly referred to as hip fractures)  are a frequent  source of morbidity and 
mortality in elderly osteoporotic patients [1]. Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type 
result in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men 
[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs 
will continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of 
life following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays 
in diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -
and long-term mortality [6-13]. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of hip fractures is critical. Hip fractures 
cannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded on the basis of physical exam ination  alone ; therefore , imaging plays a 
key role in early  and accurate diagnosis [14] .",False

sensitivity , specificity for fracture reached only 65%. The authors acknowledged that performance might further 
decrease for examinations performed by sonographers and radiologists not experienced with musculoskeletal US . 
For this document , it is assumed the procedure is performed and interpreted by an expert.  Given the inability of 
US to comprehensively evaluate the bones and soft  tissues of the pelvis, there is not enough evidence to support 
the role of US  in the workup of radiographically occult hip fracture.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 6 Acute Hip Pain -Suspected Fracture  Bone Scan H ips 
Prior to the advent of MRI, a bone scan was the preferred test for radiographically occult proximal femoral 
fractures. However, as early as 1993 , Rizzo et al [50] demonstrated MRI to be at least as accurate as bone scan s 
and with substantially decreased time to diagnosis. A later study by  Rubin et al [51] comparing bone scan s and 
MRI demonstrated i mproved sensitivity and specificity of MRI relative to bone scans . Moreover, t he bone scan 
group averaged an additional day to surgery.  
Bone scintigraphy is a time-consuming process. Bone scans may be falsely negative for up to 72 hours from the 
time of in jury, and false-positive scans are likewise common, related to osteoarthritis, soft -tissue injury , or any 
other process that may increase bone turnover [50] . It has been postulated that performing single -photon emission 
computed tomography may combine the sensitivity of bone scintig raphy with the spatial accuracy of CT , but there 
are no data to support this view. In current practice, the role of bone scan s as a secondary line of imaging in 
patients with contraindications to MRI has largely been usurped by CT.  
Summary of Recommendations 
• Variant 1:  Radiographs  of the hip, radiographs  of the pelvis, or radiographs  of the pelvis and hips is usually 
appropriate for the initial imaging of the hip with acute pain, fall or minor trauma, and suspected fracture.  
• Variant 2:  MRI pelv is and affected hip without IV contrast  or CT pelvis and hips without IV contrast is 
usually appropriate as the next imaging study for the evaluation of a cute hip pain from a fall or minor trauma  
with negative radiographs  and suspected fracture.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Fractures of the proximal femur (commonly referred to as hip fractures)  are a frequent  source of morbidity and 
mortality in elderly osteoporotic patients [1]. Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type 
result in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men 
[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs 
will continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of 
life following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays 
in diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -
and long-term mortality [6-13]. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of hip fractures is critical. Hip fractures 
cannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded on the basis of physical exam ination  alone ; therefore , imaging plays a 
key role in early  and accurate diagnosis [14] .",True

US Ankle  
US is not routinely used as the first imaging study for the evaluation of acute trauma to the ankle in the setting of

bodies or focal fluid collections . 
Variant 4 : Adult or child 5 years of age or older. Acute trauma to the ankle with persistent pain for more 
than 1 week but less than 3 weeks. No exclusionary cri teria present. Initial radiographs negative. Next study. 
Acute trauma includes immediate time of injury to  <3 weeks,  whereas subacute  trauma  includes 3 weeks to <6 
months.  The timeframe of this clinical scenario  is at the intersecti on of the late acute and  subacute  phases , and the 
OAR criteria can still apply for acute ankle trauma in this setting. Persistent pain may be associated with a 
radiographically occult fracture, bone contusion, subtle cartilage injury, soft -tissue injury, or foreign body not 
visib le on radiographic exam ination . Diagnosis is critical in determining appropriate and timely orthopedic 
fixation/treatment planning [1,5] . 
Bone Scan Ankle  
Bone scan is typically not used as the next step in this clinical scenario.  
CT Ankle   
CT of the a nkle without intravenous ( IV) contrast is useful in the trauma setting as the next study to evaluate for 
radiographic ally occult fractures and soft -tissue abnormalities. It is rare (<1%) for patients with a large joint effusion 
but no discernible fracture on radiographic examination,  however , CT proved useful in demonstrating a fracture in 
one-third of cases in one large study  [43,44] .

CT with IV contrast is not ind icated in this scenario because soft-tissue abnormalities and fluid collections can be

MRI Ankle  
MRI of the ankle without IV contrast is most sensitive for evaluation of occult fractures with associated bone 
marrow edema patterns, particularly in inversion injuries and persistent lateral ankle pain, as well  as presence and 
extent of soft -tissue injuries  [29]. Stress injuries of bone , including those of the weekend warrior , are best depicted 
by MRI  [50]. 
MRI is the reference standard for ligamentous injury and assessment of stability , which is particularly important in 
athletes, in whom determination of grade ( 1, 2, or 3) of syndesmotic ligament, anterior tibiofibular ligament , and 
deltoid injuries is critical for treatment planning and return to sport assessment [51]. High -resolution evaluation of 
the tendons and ligaments allows distinction between tendinopathy, sprain, and partial or complete tears.  
Ligament and tendon  injuries can occur without fracture on radiography . Gross terlinden et al [52] compared MR I 
and radiography and showed that 15% of ligamentous injuries ( including sprains , partial tears, and complete tears) 
at the syndesmosis in acute ankle injuries on MRI demonstrated no fracture on radiography. Presence o f bone bruise 
and adjacent soft -tissue edema have shown a higher association with acute ligamentous injuries ( anterior talofibular 
ligament most common) and tendon abnormalities [53,54]  in patients with negative radiographs.  MRI can also help 
exclude Salter 1 fractures in the pediatric population [55].

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Ankle injuries are the most common injury presenting to primary care and emergency rooms [1,2] , accounting for 
4.4% of United States emergency room visits  [3]. Acute ankle sprains (pain, swelling, limited mobility) make up 
the majority of these injuries , with an estimated incidence of 2 million per year  [4]. Diagnosis of presence and 
degree of sprain, fracture, subluxation, dislocation, cartilage abnormalities, foreign bodies , or neurovascular 
involvement are critical in determining appropriate and timely orthopedic fixation/treatme nt planning [1,5] and to 
avoid chronic pain and immobility . Appropriate use of ankle imaging guidelines and clinical decision support 
mechanisms is paramount [6,7] . 
The current standard clinical imaging guidelines to determine if radiographs are necessary are the Ottawa Ankle 
Rules (OAR), instituted in 1992.

Summary of Recommendations  
Variant 1: Ankle radiographs are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of patients 5 years of age or older with 
acute trauma to the ankle or acute trauma to the ankle with persistent pain for more than 1 week but less than 3 
weeks with no exclusionar y criteria present and the OAR  are positive : 1. Inability to bear weight immediately after 
the injury, OR  2. Point tenderness over the medial malleolus, the posterior edge or inferior tip of the lateral 
malleolus, talus, or calcaneus, OR  3. Inability to ambulate for 4 steps in the emergency department.  
Variant 2: Imaging is usually not appropriate for patients 5 years of age or older with a cute trauma to the ankle 
when the patient is able  to walk  and there are no exclusionary criteria present (eg, neurologically intact (includ ing 
no peripheral neuropathy )) and  the OAR  are negative: No point tenderness over the malleoli, talus, or calcaneus on 
physical examination.  
Variant 3: Ankle radiographs are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of patients 5 ye ars of age or older  with 
acute trauma to the ankle when exclusionary criteria are present (eg, neurologic disorder, neuropathy, or other) and 
the patient does not meet requirements for evaluation by the OAR . 
Variant 4: MRI ankle without IV contrast or CT a nkle without IV contrast  are usually appropriate  for patients 5 
years of age or older with acute trauma to the ankle with persistent pain for more than 1 week but less than 3 weeks 
that had negative initial radiographs and no exclusionary criteria are present.

Special Imaging Considerations  
Avoidance of manipulation of the  ankle prior to radiographs in the absence of neurovascular deficit or critical skin 
injury is recommended in order to avoid remanipulation or complication in this setting [27].  Advances in MRI 
technology have facilitated short dedicated extremity MRI protocols in so me centers that may be used as an 
emergent adjunct to radiographs  [28]. 
Initial Imaging Definition 
Imaging at the beginning of the care episode for the medical condition defined by the variant. More than one 
procedure can be considered usually appropriate in the initial imaging evaluation when:  
• There are procedures that are equivalent alternatives (ie,  only one procedure will be ordered to 
provide the clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care)  
OR 
• There are complementary procedures (ie, more than one procedure is ordered as a set or 
simultaneously in which  each procedure provides uniq ue clinical information to effectively manage 
the patient’s care).

during winter months [67] and increased incidence in military recruits [68]. Inversion injuries of the ankle account 
for 25% of musculoskeletal system injuries and 50% of all sports -related injuries [1].  
Bone Scan Ankle  
Bone scan is not routinely the next line of imaging in this clinical scenario.  
CT Ankle  
CT is useful for evaluation of dislocation and can be used to detect  syndesmotic injuries, although MRI is better for 
soft-tissue evaluation. Nault et al [69]  validated CT scan measurement s that  can identify syndesmotic injuries seen 
on MRI (retrosp ective study of MRI and CT) as a result of  modification of distal tibiofibular relationship after a 
mild syndesmotic injury.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 10 Acute Trauma to the Ankle  Rare pantalar dislocations without associated talar or other fracture can be assessed on CT or MRI and have high 
rates of osteonecrosis, osteoarthritis, and infection  [71]. 
MRI Ankle  
MRI is the reference standard for ligamentous injury and assessment of stability , which is particularly important in 
athletes, in whom determination of grade (1, 2,  or 3) of syndesmotic ligament, anterior tibiofibular ligament , and 
deltoid injuries is critica l for treatment planning and return to sport assessment [51] . 
Ligamentous injuries can occur without fracture on radiography. Grossterlinden et al  [52] compared MRI and 
radiography and showed that 15% of ligamentous injuries (including sprains, partial tears, and complete tears) at 
the syndesmosis in acute ankle injuries on M RI demonstra ted no fracture on radiography.  
Rare pantalar dislocations without associated talar or other fracture can be assessed on CT or MRI and have high 
rates of osteonecrosis, osteoarthritis, and infection  [71]. 
Radiography Ankle Stress Views  
Stress radiograph s may be useful in assessing syndesmotic instability, particularly in supination external rotation 
ankle injuries according to the Lauge -Hansen classification. Lee et al [72]  noted that tibiotalar tilt angle and anterior 
tibiofibular space measurements were affected when the anterior tibiofibular and posterior talofibular ligaments 
were injured (confirmed on MRI) in 299 patients . Lateral stress testing with widening of the tibiofibular clear space 
has been shown to be  an indicator of syndesmotic injury , with the traditional external rotation stress test shown to 
be a poor indicator when t he deltoid ligament is injured [73] . 
Radiography Leg 
Maisonneuve fracture (syndesmotic injury of the ankle in combination with a proximal fibular fracture) may be 
overlooked as a result of  lack of pain at the fibula.

Summary of Recommendations  
Variant 1: Ankle radiographs are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of patients 5 years of age or older with 
acute trauma to the ankle or acute trauma to the ankle with persistent pain for more than 1 week but less than 3 
weeks with no exclusionar y criteria present and the OAR  are positive : 1. Inability to bear weight immediately after 
the injury, OR  2. Point tenderness over the medial malleolus, the posterior edge or inferior tip of the lateral 
malleolus, talus, or calcaneus, OR  3. Inability to ambulate for 4 steps in the emergency department.  
Variant 2: Imaging is usually not appropriate for patients 5 years of age or older with a cute trauma to the ankle 
when the patient is able  to walk  and there are no exclusionary criteria present (eg, neurologically intact (includ ing 
no peripheral neuropathy )) and  the OAR  are negative: No point tenderness over the malleoli, talus, or calcaneus on 
physical examination.  
Variant 3: Ankle radiographs are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of patients 5 ye ars of age or older  with 
acute trauma to the ankle when exclusionary criteria are present (eg, neurologic disorder, neuropathy, or other) and 
the patient does not meet requirements for evaluation by the OAR . 
Variant 4: MRI ankle without IV contrast or CT a nkle without IV contrast  are usually appropriate  for patients 5

If there are clinical  signs  of a Lisfranc  injury , obtaining  weight bearing  radiographs  is recommended  when  
possible  because nonweightbearing  radiographs  are not reliable  for detection  of subtle  injuries.  Weightbearing  
views have  been  shown  to increase the abnormal  alignment  at the Lisfranc joint, thus making it easier  to identify  a

Radiograph y Foot  
Radiographs  are indicated  by positive  Ottawa rules with 99% sensitivity  in determining  the presence of a foot 
fracture  [1,9,10] . Radiographs  are the mainstay  of initial imaging in the setting  of acute foot trauma.  Initial  
imaging typically  consists of a 3-view study  with the possibility  of additional  views as indicated  by the clinical  
setting  [8]. Additional  views,  such as axial  calcaneal  view,  can be useful  in patients  with suspected  calcaneal  
fracture  [15] because addition of this view  increases specificity  in diagnosing calcaneal  fractures  and sensitivity  in 
distinguishing intra-articular  calcaneal  fractures.  
Lisfranc  Injury  
When  there is a fairly  high clinical  suspicion  of an acute Lisfranc injury,  the foot should be imaged.  In addition  to 
a typical  3-view  radiographic  study  of the foot (anteroposterior  [AP],  oblique,  and lateral),  an AP view with 20° 
craniocaudal  angulation can be added  [16,17] . Although patients  with Lisfra nc sprains may incur  ligamentous  
damage  without  diastasis [18], radiography  should be the initial imaging modality  in the setting  of a suspected  
Lisfranc injury.

both the Ottawa and Pittsburgh  rules and radiographs  may be beneficial  despite lack of clinical  symptoms.  
Radiographs  are commonly  performed  in the setting  of acute knee  injuries  but have  a low yield  for showing  
fractures.  In a retrospective review of 1,967 patients  with acute knee  injuries  by Stiell et al [2], 74.1%  of patients

A retrospective study  by Cecava et al [25] showed  that knee  radiography  is a highly specific screening  test for 
internal  derangement  in patients  <40 years old with acute knee injury.  In this patient population,  knee  effusion  >10 
mm on lateral  radiograph  should prompt  consideration  for the knee  MRI examination , which  can potentially  
decrease delayed  diagnosis,  improve  patient  outcomes,  and decrease  disability  [25].  
Magee et al [26] reported  96% sensitivity  and 97% specificity  of 3T MRI in the detection  of meniscal  tears in

menisci  and ACL  compared  with a similar  1.5T MRI  protocol.

Bone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the 
subchondral bone.  New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or 
patients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee 
pain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the 
origin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. 
Subchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed 
spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to 
elderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs 
often initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, 
and progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is 
suspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria
® 
topic on “ Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae ” [28]. 
Some patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using 
quantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs 
exhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ].

Special Imaging  Considerations  
Knee radiographs  should include at least one frontal projection of one or both knees (anteroposterior, Rosenberg, 
or tunnel), a tangential patellar view , and a lateral view of the affected knee [2,9]. Standing radiographs more 
accurately reflect medial and lateral compartment cartilage loss than supine radiographs with the posteromedial and posterolateral joint compartments  more accurately assessed using a weight -bearing flexion posteroanterior

Summary of Literature Review  
Background/Introduction 
Chronic knee pain affects tens of millions of people  in the United States annually , with the pain sometimes highly 
disabling and often negatively impacting the patient’s quality of life. Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and 
it can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain 
with the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. 
Typically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain 
persists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  
imaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated 
that approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the 
prior year) radiographs [2 ]. 
This document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  ≥5 years of age.

Variant 5: Chronic ankle pain. Ankle radiographs normal or nonspecific, suspected ankle instability. Next study . 
In the absence of findings on routine radiography, imaging options to evaluate ligamentous integrity include stress radiography, MRI, MR arthrography, CT arthrography, and US.  
MRI  
One study eva luating anterior talofibular ligament injury demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy of 97% for MRI 
when compared to arthroscopic findings. Additionally, MRI identified the exact location of the injury in 93% of 
the cases [15].  Comparing MRI with arthroscopy, studies have shown a range of accuracies of chronic lateral 
ligament tearing (either partial or complete), ranging from 77 % to 92% for the anterior talofibular ligament and 
88% to 92% for the calcaneofibular ligament [14, 52]. For the evaluation of deep deltoid ligament tears, MRI is 
both sensitive and specific compared with arthroscopy, with reported values of 96% and 98%, respectively [53].  
With regard to tears of the tibiofibular ligaments of the tibiofibular syndesmosis, MRI has a reported accuracy of 100% [54]. Additionally, MRI can also demonstrate interosseous membrane tears [55]. MRI offers the advantage 
of evaluating for injuries associated with or mimicking lateral instability that may not be diagnosed on stress radiography such as tenosynovitis, tendon injury, and osteochondral lesions [56]. MRI may also be used to evaluate the ankle after lateral ligament reconstruction [57].  
MR Arthrography  
MR arthrography can be helpful for the assessment of chronic ankle instability due to lateral collateral ligament injuries [12].  
US 
One study evaluating anterior talofibular ligamen t injury demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy of 91% for US when 
compared to arthroscopic findings.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Ankle pain is considered chronic when symptoms persist > 6 weeks. Chronic ankle  pain can be caused by a variety 
of osseous or soft -tissue abnormalities, either alone or in combination. For assessing chronic ankle pain, there are 
multiple imaging options, including radiography, stress radiography,  computed tomography (CT)  radionuclide 
bone scanning, ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and various injection procedures. Injection 
proce dures include arthrography, CT arthrography, MR arthrography, and diagnostic injection with anesthetic 
agents. Although there are numerous causes for chronic ankle pain, common etiologies include osteoarthritis, 
osteochondral injury, tendon abnormalities, ligament abnormalities and instability, and impingement.  
Overview of Imaging Modalities  
Radiography Radiographs can provide information about the osseous and soft -tissue structures about the ankle. Routine 
radiographs of the ankle typically include anteroposterior, lateral, and mortise views, the latter obtained by internally rotating the foot 15 to 20 degrees.

• Image -guided anesthetic injection ankle and hindfoot , MRI ankle and hindfoot  without IV contrast, or C T 
ankle and hindfoot  without IV contrast may be appropriate as the next study for degenerative joint disease in 
the hindfoot detected by ankle radiographs.  
• MRI ankle without IV contrast should be the next imaging study when ankle radiographs are normal for  
suspected osteochondral lesion.  
• Either MRI ankle without IV contrast or US ankle should be ordered when tendon abnormality is suspected  
and ankle radiographs are normal.  
• Either MRI ankle without IV contrast or MR arthrography of the ankle should be ordere d when ankle 
instability is suspected  and ankle radiographs are normal.  
• MRI ankle without IV contrast should be ordered when ankle impingement syndrome is suspected and ankle 
radiographs are normal.  
• MRI ankle without IV contrast should be ordered as the ne xt study after radiographs when there is pain of 
uncertain etiology and ankle radiographs are normal .

Page Content: However, MRI features supportive of impingement may be present in asymptomatic individuals, and 
an accurate diagnosis requires careful correlation of imaging features findings with clinical findings [76]. There 
are only limited reports on the use of MRI for the other forms of ankle impingement syndrome, so its accuracy in 
these conditions is not well established [62, 64,67,68]. 
CT Arthrography  
One study involving anterolateral ankle impingement compared CT arthrography to arthroscopic findings. The 
study found that CT arthrography had a sensitivity and specificity of 97% and 71%, respectively [77].  
Image-guided Anesthetic Injection  
Fluoroscopic  or US-guided injection s have been shown as an effective treatment for some  ankle impingement 
syndromes [78,79]. 
Bone Scan with SPECT or SPECT/CT  
Recently, SPECT combined with CT has been shown to provide additional information compared with clinical diagnosis and conventional bone scintigraphy for the evaluation of impingement syndromes and soft -tissue 
pathology [7]. One study found that SPECT/CT provided information not sus pected on clinical diagnosis in 56% 
of cases with impingement syndromes or soft -tissue pathology [7 ]. 
CT 
CT may be useful for depiction of osseous causes of imp ingement, such as chronic abnormalities between the 
talus and an os trigonum or fractures of the lateral tubercle of the talus or os trigonum [62].  
Arthrography  
Arthrography is not routinely used for the evaluation of ankle impingement syndromes.  
Radiography Stress views are not routinely used for the evaluation of ankle impingement syndromes.  
Variant 7: Chronic ankle pain. Ankle radiographs normal, pain of uncertain etiology. Next study. 
When chronic ankle pain is of unclear etiology, normal ankle radiographs can be followed by other imaging tests, 
primarily directed by clinical findings.

MRI Elbow  
MRI elbow  may detect  loose  bodies,  and this is enhanced  in the presence of joint fluid.  Thus,  T2-weighted  images  
are recommended for the evaluation  of loose  bodies  in the elbow  [17]. MRI may also show  the presence of enlarged  
plica,  which  can result  in symptoms  of locking  and/or  pain with extension  [15]. MRI is often  suggested  as the initial  
study to assess for osteochondral  lesion  [12,17] . MRI  is less sensitive  than radiographs  in the detection  of

cartilage defects [16]. 
US Elbow  
Although US may demonstrate  early -stage osteochondral  lesions and medial  epicondylar  fragmentation  [10], the 
details  of an osteochondral  lesion  are better  defined  by CT arthrography or MR arthrography.  Because of

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  elbow  pain is a common  patient  complaint  in the primary  care setting. Patients  may report  symptoms  of 
swelling,  pain,  restricted  range  of motion,  stiffness,  and numbness  or tingling  [1]. There is a wide  differential  
diagnosis  for chronic  elbow  pain, including osseous,  soft tissue,  cartil aginous , and nerve -related  abnormalities.  
Epicondylalgia , caused  by tendinosis  of the common  extensor  tendon laterally  (“tennis elbow”)  or medially  the 
common  flexor  tendon  (“golfer’s  elbow ”), is the most  common  cause of chronic  elbow  pain,  estimated  to occur in 
1% to 3% of the population  [2]. Epicondylalgia  is associated  with lost workdays  and a significant  economic  burden

of chronic  elbow  pain,  including  biceps tendinopathy,  osteochondral  injuries, collateral  ligament  tears,  and cubital

Imaging plays  an important  role in assessment  of chronic  elbow  pain.  Electromyography  assists in the workup 
related  to nerve  symptoms.  Management  for epicondylalgia  and osteoarthritis  includes  conservative measures such 
as rest, activity  modification, analgesia,  physical  therapy,  and corticosteroid  injections. Surgery  may be indicated  
for more  severe or refractory  cases and cases of collateral  ligament  injury,  biceps injury, cubital  tunnel  syndrome,

• Variant 2 : In the setting of chronic elbow pain with mechanical symptoms such as locking, clicking, or limited 
range of motion with normal or nonspecific radiographs, MR arthrography elbow or MRI elbow without IV 
contrast or CT arthrography elbow or CT elbow without IV contrast  is usually appropriate as the next imaging 
study for suspect intra-articular pathology such as osteocartilaginous body, osteochondral lesion, or synovial 
abnormality. These procedures are equivalent altern atives (ie, only one procedure will be ordered to provide 
the clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).

Page Content: In rare cases of secondary carpal tunnel syndrome, MRI may identify 
a mass lesion compressing the median nerve. There is some evidence that the length of T2 hyperintensity in the 
median nerve can help prognosticate the success of surgery [69] and that the shape and signal of the nerve predict 
clinical response to a steroid injection in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome [70 ]. MR neurography 
may be an option in patients with suspected carpal tunnel syndrome.  The use o f IV contrast does not contribute to 
diagnosis and is usually not appropriate.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
MR arthrography is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.  
CT Wrist  
CT, with or without IV  contrast, is not routinely used to diagnose carpa l tunnel syndrome.  
CT Arthrography  Wrist  
CT arthrography is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.  
Bone Scan  Wrist  
Bone scan is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.  
Arthrography  Wrist  
Radiographic arthrography  is not routinely us ed to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome . 
Summary of Recommendations  
• Wrist radiographs are indicated as the best initial imaging examination in patients with chronic wrist pain. 
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal and a patient has persistent symptoms wi th an unclear diagnosis, 
MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate.  
• In patients with suspected inflammatory arthritis, MRI either with or without IV contrast is usually 
appropriate if guidance for management or prognostication is needed.  
• Patients with  suspected wrist infection should undergo aspiration.  
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal in a patient with ulnar -sided pain, either MRI without IV contrast 
or an MR arthrogram of the wrist is usually appropriate.  
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal in a patient with radial -sided pain, MRI without IV contrast is 
usually appropriate.

US Wrist 
Several meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the 
carpal  tunnel  inlet) is highly accurate for identifying carpal  tunnel syndrome  diagnosed clinically or with the 
combination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US 
varies depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the 
measurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary 
examination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel 
syndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal 
tunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, 
clinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of 
carpal tunnel syndrome. US may be appropriate in cases where this initial evaluation is equivocal.  
MRI Wrist  
Historically, carpal tunnel syndrome has been diagnosed based on clinical signs and sympt oms and confirmed by 
the results of electrodiagnostic studies [67]. MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in cases in which this  
initial evaluation is equivocal. The MRI findings that have been reported in wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome —
including nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing—may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value 
in patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68].",True

Introduction/Background 
The Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention  National  Diabetes Statistics  Report  of 2017 states that 30.3 
million  people  in the United  States  have  diabetes (9.4%  of the population)  [1]. Diabetes-related  foot 
complications , such as soft-tissue infection, osteomyelitis , and neuropathic  osteoarthropathy,  account  for up to 
20% of all diabetic -related  North  American  hospital  admissions,  with up to $1.5 billion  spent  annually in the 
United  States  on diabetic  foot ulcer  care [2]. 
Neuropathic  changes in the foot are present  in about  1% of diabetics [3]. Neuropathic  osteoarthropathy  is a 
progressive  process affecting  the bones,  joints , and soft tissue of the foot and ankle.  Delay  in the diagnosis  may 
lead to derangement  of the bony architecture of the foot, deformity,  recurrent  foot ulcerations,  cellulitis,  
osteomyelitis , and amputation [4]. 
Imaging findings  should not be interpreted  in isolation.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
In patients with chronic wrist pain, imaging studies are  an important adjunct to history, physical examination, 
laboratory testing, and electrophysiology studies. The choice of imaging modality depends on the patient’s 
presentation and the clinical questions being asked. There are scenarios in which no imaging beyond baseline 
radiographs is necessary, but in other situations advanced imaging has added value for diagnostic eva luation and 
treatment planning.  
Overview of Imaging Modalities  
Radiographs  
Imaging evaluation of the painful wrist should begin with radiog raphs [1,2]. This simple study may establish a 
specific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, 
impaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -
anterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or 
more oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling 
[3]. A v ariety of stress positions and maneuvers can be performed to elicit dynamic instability that is not visible 
on standard radiographs [ 4]. Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. 
Additionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ].

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 10 Chronic Wrist Pain  importantly, though, the finding of enhancing bone marrow “edema” (osteitis) on MRI studies in patients with 
early RA is proving to be the best single predictor of future disease progression and functional dete rioration, even 
compared to serologies and clinical measures [27, 28,32-34].  
US Wrist  
The diagnosis of a specific inflammatory arthritis is typically established based on clinical and laboratory 
analysis. Advanced imaging is usually performed to determine disease activity, guide management decisions, and prognosticate outcomes. In patients with RA, US  of the wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints can  show 
inflammation  as active synovitis. Identifying active synovitis with power Doppler assessment is a useful adjunct 
in making an early diagnosis of RA when a pati ent with early arthritis does not meet the 2010 criteria established 
by the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism [20]. The presence of 
synovitis predicts progression of erosions [31 ] and erosions themselves [35]. US can also depict small bone 
erosions with high spatial resolution; h owever, US is less sensitive to erosions that occur on the radial or ulnar 
sides of the inner carpal bones because direct scanning of these regions is blocked, unlike the dorsal and volar 
bone surfaces. Furthermore, unlike MRI, US cannot show changes within the bone marrow, which are  the 
strongest prognosticator s for disease progression in RA [27, 28,32-34].  In patients with established inflammatory 
arthritis who are undergoing therapy, judging progression or reduction of synovitis may be more difficult with 
sequential US compared to sequential MRI.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
MR arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected inflammatory 
arthritides. 
CT Wrist  
While CT is more sensitive than radiographs for erosions, CT is not routinely used for the diagnosis and 
management of patients with suspected inflammatory arthritides .

While there is no recent literature that directly addresses the role of first-line examinations for chronic wrist pain, 
radiographs are usually  appropriate as an initial study. Radiographs are widely available , and for many bone, 
joint, and alignment abnormalities, radiographs alone are diagnostic. In other patients, nonspecific radiologic findings (including those in the soft  tissues) combined with the history and physical examination may be

Clinical concern includes sesamoiditis, Morton’s  neuroma, intermetatarsal bursitis, chronic plantar plate

Bone Scan Foot  
Planar b one scintigraphy has low anatomic resolution and has been shown to be a nonspecific technique to assess 
the hallucal sesamoids [24]. However, bone scintigraphy with single -photon emission computed tomography 
(SPECT)/CT increases contrast resolution and anatomic localization of foci with increased osteoblastic activity  
[25]. Bone scintigraphy may demonstrate increased uptake in pathologic conditions affecting the fir st metatarsal 
sesamoids not evident on radiographs. A less dramatic uptake is noted in stress fractures, which may be helpful to 
differentiate between them and acute fractures [26]. When an indeter minate linear lucency is visualized on 
radiographs, a negative bone scintigraphy suggest s sesamoid bipartition [12] . Other conditions that may present 
positive findings on Tc -99m -methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scint igraphy include sesamoiditis, 
inflammatory or deposition arthropathies, osteoarthritis , and osteonecrosis [39]. In Freiberg’s infraction, a 
photopenic center with a hyperactive collar may be identified on early stages on high -resolution Tc -99m -MDP bone 
scintigraphy [27]. 
CT Foot  
CT may be useful to confirm suspected sesamoid stress fractures on radiographs and to distinguish between a stress 
fracture and a bipartite sesamoid with more precision than conventional radiography [28] .

Introduction/Background 
Chronic foot pain is a frequent clinical complaint with approximately 14% to 42% of adults in the United States 
reporting foot problems, often with significant impact on mobility, difficulty performing daily activities , and 
increased risk of falling, particularly in older individuals [1,2] . Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a 
significant improvement in health-related quality of life with effective treatment of foot pain [3] . Estimating the 
prevalence of chron ic foot pain is challenging, because there is no consensus regarding the definition of chronic 
pain in the literature. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines chronic pain as any pain persisting 
past the normal healing time, suggesting 3 months in case of chronic pain of benign causes.  
Women are more commonly affected , and forefoot conditions are more frequent. Persistent pain for more than 6  
years has been reported in 51% of women between 70 to 75 years of age [4]. Because of  the wide range of causes 
of chronic foot pain, assessment of these patients with imaging studies in addition to a dedicated clinical

feasible.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
Direct MR arthrography (with contrast injection either into the radiocarpal joint or into all three  compartments of 
the wrist) may be appropriate in this scenario; the examination has higher sensitivity than noncontrast -enhanced 
MRI—even when performed at 3.0 T —for diagnosis of complete and incomplete scapholunate and lunotriquetral 
ligament tears [3 ,8,38]. For the scapholunate ligament, direct MR  arthrography also allows more accurate 
determination of which specific segments of the ligament are torn compared to conventional MRI [43], which has 
important biomechanical implications for wrist stability. Direct MR arthrography also has an advantage over 
noncontrast -enhanced MRI for diagnosing extrinsic ligament abnormalities [44].  
CT Arthrography  Wrist  
The accuracy of CT arthrography and MR arthrography are similar for lesions of the scapholunate ligament [8 ].

Variant 12: Chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or nonspecific. Suspect carpal tunnel syndrome.  Next

US Wrist 
Several meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the 
carpal  tunnel  inlet) is highly accurate for identifying carpal  tunnel syndrome  diagnosed clinically or with the 
combination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US 
varies depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the 
measurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary 
examination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel 
syndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal 
tunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, 
clinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of 
carpal tunnel syndrome. US may be appropriate in cases where this initial evaluation is equivocal.  
MRI Wrist  
Historically, carpal tunnel syndrome has been diagnosed based on clinical signs and sympt oms and confirmed by 
the results of electrodiagnostic studies [67]. MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in cases in which this  
initial evaluation is equivocal. The MRI findings that have been reported in wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome —
including nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing—may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value 
in patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68].

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
In patients with chronic wrist pain, imaging studies are  an important adjunct to history, physical examination, 
laboratory testing, and electrophysiology studies. The choice of imaging modality depends on the patient’s 
presentation and the clinical questions being asked. There are scenarios in which no imaging beyond baseline 
radiographs is necessary, but in other situations advanced imaging has added value for diagnostic eva luation and 
treatment planning.  
Overview of Imaging Modalities  
Radiographs  
Imaging evaluation of the painful wrist should begin with radiog raphs [1,2]. This simple study may establish a 
specific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, 
impaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -
anterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or 
more oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling 
[3]. A v ariety of stress positions and maneuvers can be performed to elicit dynamic instability that is not visible 
on standard radiographs [ 4]. Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. 
Additionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ].

spin-echo or 3-D grad ient-recalled pulse sequences [36]. There is some evidence suggesting that MRI performed 
with a 3.0 T system is even more accurate than MRI performed with a 1.5 T system for TFCC lesions [37], but 
there are no studies comparing the accuracy of the two field s trengths in the same patients. The sensitivity for 
tears of the ulnar attachment of the disc and the peripheral attachments (the ulnocarpal ligaments) are only fair 
with noncontrast -enhanced wrist MRI [ 12,36]. IV contrast seldom provides added benefit in patients with ulnar -

Page Content: These factors make CT the 
preferred examination for suspected distal radioulnar joint subluxation, where images of both wrists can be  
obtained in both supination and pronation [1 ,13]. A disadvantage of CT  is its lower sensitivity to soft -tissue 
abnormalities  compared with MRI.  
High-resolution (typically multidetector) CT of the wrist following contrast injection into one or more wrist 
compartments (CT arthrography) is a powerful tool for diagnosing intra -articular abnormalities [14,15]. The 
intraobserver agreement on CT arthrogram images is extremely high and better than that reported for MRI 
[14,16]. 
US 
US of the wrist is useful for examining extra -articular soft tissues, such as suspected ganglion cyst s [17], because 
its accuracy is similar to that of MRI. US can also be used to diagnose abnormalities of the flexor and extensor 
tendons and tendon sheaths. For de Quervain disease (stenosing tenosynovitis of the abductor pollicis lon gus and 
extensor pollicis brevis tendon compartment), preoperative identification of a septum or subcompartmentalization 
within the first dorsal compartment with US  may affect surgical management [18 ,19]. 
In patients with suspected or established rheumatoid arthritis (RA), US examination of the wrist and selected 
finger joints can identify erosions and active synovit is (with the use of power Doppler), findings that influence 
early diagnosis and treatment decisions [20]. Using US to measure the size of the median nerve is a  validated  
technique in patients with clinical symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome [21-24].  
In addition, w rist US is a useful technique to guide therapeutic intr a-articular and other soft -tissue injections [25].

both the flexor and extensor wrist compartments [46]. Occult ganglion cysts are also easily identified with MRI, 
but some authors recommend use of IV contrast to distinguish ganglia from synovitis [ 47]. For noncystic soft-
tissue masses, MRI may demonstrate findings that are diagnostic for certain benign conditions (eg, lipomas, 
hemangiomas, benign nerve sheath tumors), and can stage the extent of involvement for nonspecific masses ( see

sufficient for clinical diagnosis, or may suggest preferred secondary imaging studies.  
MRI  
MRI is no t routinely used in the initial evaluation of chronic wrist pain.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
In patients with chronic wrist pain, imaging studies are  an important adjunct to history, physical examination, 
laboratory testing, and electrophysiology studies. The choice of imaging modality depends on the patient’s 
presentation and the clinical questions being asked. There are scenarios in which no imaging beyond baseline 
radiographs is necessary, but in other situations advanced imaging has added value for diagnostic eva luation and 
treatment planning.  
Overview of Imaging Modalities  
Radiographs  
Imaging evaluation of the painful wrist should begin with radiog raphs [1,2]. This simple study may establish a 
specific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, 
impaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -
anterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or 
more oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling 
[3]. A v ariety of stress positions and maneuvers can be performed to elicit dynamic instability that is not visible 
on standard radiographs [ 4]. Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. 
Additionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ].

While CT with IV contrast enhancement can depict abscesses, it is usually not appropriate  for evaluation of 
suspected wrist infections.  
CT Arthrography  Wrist  
CT arthrography is not routinely used to eval uate suspected wrist infection.  
US Wrist  
There may be a role for US in the staging of infections (for example, to delineate the location and e xtent of soft -
tissue abscesses) after aspiration has been performed.  Alternatively, US may be used in conjunction with 
aspiration as a method to first identify collections and then as the imaging method to guide aspiration.  
Bone Scan  Wrist  
Bone scan is not  routinely used to eval uate suspected chronic wrist infection.  
Arthrography  Wrist  
Radiographic arthrography  is not routinely used to eval uate suspected wrist infection.  
Variant 5:  Ulnar -sided chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or nonspecific . Next study.  
MRI Wrist  
Both traumatic and degenerative lesions of the TFCC can produce chronic, ulnar -sided wrist pain . MRI is highly 
accurate for lesions involving the radial (central) zone of the disc, especially with the use of high -resolution fast 
spin-echo or 3-D grad ient-recalled pulse sequences [36]. There is some evidence suggesting that MRI performed 
with a 3.0 T system is even more accurate than MRI performed with a 1.5 T system for TFCC lesions [37], but 
there are no studies comparing the accuracy of the two field s trengths in the same patients. The sensitivity for 
tears of the ulnar attachment of the disc and the peripheral attachments (the ulnocarpal ligaments) are only fair 
with noncontrast -enhanced wrist MRI [ 12,36]. IV contrast seldom provides added benefit in patients with ulnar -
sided wrist pain but may increase sensitivity for TFCC lesions if MR arthrography is desired but direct joint 
injection is not feasible.

Variant 3: Chronic wrist pain. Routine radiographs normal or nonspecific. Suspect inflammatory arthritis. Next study.  
MRI Wrist  
The diagnosis of a specific inflammatory arthritis is typically established based on clinical and laboratory 
analysis. Advanced imaging is usually performed to determine disease activity, guide management decisions, and 
prognosticate outcomes. In patients with early RA and other inflammatory arthritides , active synovitis may be 
better quantified following MRI with IV contrast administration, possibly  if performed dynamically, allowing 
confident early diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment guidance in these patients  [27,28]. Additionally, 
inflammatory tenosynovitis may be more conspicuous after IV  contrast administration [29]. As is the case for any 
tomographic study, MRI is much more sensitive than radiographs for identifying erosions in RA [30 ,31]. More

For further evaluation  of disorders  such as dysplasia or FAI, specialized  views such as the false  profile  or elongated  
femoral  neck  lateral  (Dunn)  views  can provide  more  detailed  evaluation  of the anatomy  of the femoral  head  and

US Hip 
In general,  US is limited  in its use for evaluating  osseous structures.  However,  there is limited  literature  that 
demonstrates that US can be used to evaluate osseous features of FAI such as the alpha -angle  [73]. However,  US is 
not able to adequately  evaluate osseous abnormalities  deep  to the cortex.  One of the advantages  of US is its ability  
to dynamically  evaluate for extra-articular  soft tissue  impingement.  US is not as sensitive as MRI or CT 
arthrography  for the detection  of labral  tears  [17], but it can be useful  for the detection  and localization  of paralabral

Chronic  hip pain is a common chief  complaint  for patients , reportedly affecting  30% to 40% of adults  who play 
sports  [1,2] , and 12% to 15% of all adults  over 60 [3,4] . A wide variety  of pathological  entities  may cause hip pain, 
including  osseous  as well as intra- or extra -articular  soft tissue abnormalities  [5-7]. Pathology  involving  the lumbar  
spine,  sacroiliac,  or knee  joints  can also cause hip pain [8], and these  etiologies  should  be investigated  as needed .

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  hip pain is a common chief  complaint  for patients , reportedly affecting  30% to 40% of adults  who play 
sports  [1,2] , and 12% to 15% of all adults  over 60 [3,4] . A wide variety  of pathological  entities  may cause hip pain, 
including  osseous  as well as intra- or extra -articular  soft tissue abnormalities  [5-7]. Pathology  involving  the lumbar  
spine,  sacroiliac,  or knee  joints  can also cause hip pain [8], and these  etiologies  should  be investigated  as needed . 
There is limited  original  research  that specifically  targets the imaging  of chronic  hip pain,  but imaging  of specific  
conditions  is widely  discussed  in the published  literature. 
Before  imaging,  an appropriate  assessment  of a patient’s  clinical  history  and physical  examination  is essential  in

In general,  US is limited  in its use for evaluating  osseous structures.  However,  there is limited  literature  that 
demonstrates that US can be used to evaluate osseous features of FAI such as the alpha -angle  [73]. However,  US is 
not able to adequately  evaluate osseous abnormalities  deep  to the cortex.  One of the advantages  of US is its ability  
to dynamically  evaluate for extra-articular  soft tissue  impingement.  US is not as sensitive as MRI or CT 
arthrography  for the detection  of labral  tears  [17], but it can be useful  for the detection  and localization  of paralabral

Summary of Recommendations  
• Variant 1:  Radiographs  of the knee  are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of  chronic knee pain in 
patients greater than or equal to 5 years of age.  
• Variant 2:  MRI knee without  IV contrast is usually appropriate in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of 
age with chronic knee pain when initial knee  radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion.  
• Variant 3:  MRI knee without  IV contrast is usually appropriate  in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of 
age with chronic knee pain when initial knee radiographs demonstrate OCD,  loose bodies, or history of 
cartilage or meniscal repair.  
• Variant 4:  (1) MRI knee without IV contrast  or (2)  knee aspiration or (3)  CT knee without  IV contrast may 
be appropriate  in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of age with chronic knee pain when initial 
radiographs de monstrate degenerative changes or chondrocalcinosis. While MRI knee without  IV contrast 
may be appropriate more often, knee aspiration and CT knee without IV contrast may be appropriate in 
specific instances detailed in the narrative. On occasion, these ex aminations  may complement each other  with 
more than one being appropriate .

Bone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the 
subchondral bone.  New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or 
patients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee 
pain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the 
origin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. 
Subchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed 
spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to 
elderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs 
often initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, 
and progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is 
suspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria
® 
topic on “ Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae ” [28]. 
Some patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using 
quantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs 
exhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ].

suspected arthritis  or synovitis [ 8]. 
Special Imaging  Considerations  
Knee radiographs  should include at least one frontal projection of one or both knees (anteroposterior, Rosenberg, 
or tunnel), a tangential patellar view , and a lateral view of the affected knee [2,9]. Standing radiographs more 
accurately reflect medial and lateral compartment cartilage loss than supine radiographs with the posteromedial and posterolateral joint compartments  more accurately assessed using a weight -bearing flexion posteroanterior 
radiograph [9,10].

Summary of Literature Review  
Background/Introduction 
Chronic knee pain affects tens of millions of people  in the United States annually , with the pain sometimes highly 
disabling and often negatively impacting the patient’s quality of life. Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and 
it can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain 
with the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. 
Typically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain 
persists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  
imaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated 
that approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the 
prior year) radiographs [2 ]. 
This document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  ≥5 years of age.

Page Content: Patellofemoral car tilage loss is also associated with chronic knee pain , with active knee pain correlated with 
BMLs [30,31]. Similar to CT, MRI can calculate various anatomic measurements associated with patellofemoral 
subluxation/dislocation and lateral patellofemoral friction syndrome [32-34]. Bone marrow edema in the classic 
location for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also 
differentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise 
therapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. 
Other etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat 
pad impingement syndromes, Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome, adhesive 
capsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes , 
and osteonecrosis [15, 19,36-45].  
MRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a 
joint effusion. However, contrast -enhanced images ma y be more accurate in diagnosing other causes of chronic 
knee pain , such as Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome, and adhesive 
capsulitis [15].  In particular, enh ancing synovitis thicker than 2 mm in Hoffa’s fat is correlated with peripatellar 
pain [46]. Contrast -enhanced MRI is also useful in quantifying the degree of synovitis and in evaluating 
conditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis [ 17,42,47,48].

Bone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the

patients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee

comparable alternative  to MR arthrography in the evaluation  of rotator  cuff tendon tears [16,17] . CT arthrography 
is able to detect  very subtle  articular  surface cuff defects,  but, because of lack of contrast  extension  from  the 
glenohumeral  joint space,  it is less effective at demonstrating bursal  surface or intrasubstance tears,  which  are

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  shoulder  pain lasting  >6 months  is a common  presenting  complaint , particularly  in patients  ≥40 years of 
age [1]. Along with a thorough history and physical  examination,  imaging  plays  a critical  role in determining the 
source of chronic  shoul der pain.  Common pain generators in the shoulder  include  the rotator  cuff tendons,  biceps 
tendon,  labrum,  glenohumeral  articular  cartilage,  acromioclavicular  joint, bones,  suprascapular  and axillary  nerves,  
and the joint capsule/synovium.  Imaging  can help to guide  appropriate  therapy , which  can range  from  conservative  
measures such as physical  therapy  and cortico steroid  injections  to more  invasive  procedures  such as arthroscopy or 
surgery . This document  focuses on the imaging approach  to patients  with suspected  chronic  mechanical  shoulder

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 15 Chronic Shoulder Pain  Radiography Shoulder  Additional Views  
Glenohumeral  osteoarthritis  is typically  well visualized  on conventional  radiographic  views,  without  the need  for 
special  views.  A standard  axillary  view can demonstrate posterior  subluxation of the humeral  head  and abnormal  
glenoid morphology in patients with severe osteoarthritis  [145-147] . A measurement  of the critical shoulder  angle  
can be drawn  on routine  AP radiographs  by measuring  the angle  between  a line along the glenoid  surface and a line 
from  the inferior glenoid to the lateral  acromial  margin;  patients  with a higher  measurement  may be at high risk of 
having a full thickness rotator  cuff tear [148] . 
US Shoulder  
Although secondary  signs  of osteoarthritis  such as osteophytes,  joint effusion , and intra-articular  bodies  can be seen 
with US [142] , it is not typically  performed  for this indication.  
Variant  8: Chronic  shoulder  pain. History  of prior  rotator  cuff repair.  Suspect  rotator  cuff disorders or 
subacromial  subdeltoid bursitis. Initial radiographs  normal  or inconclusive. Next  imaging  study.

US is reported  to be 98% sensitive and 94% specific for calcium  hydroxyapatite  in the rotator  cuff tendons  [71], 
although  identification  may be challenging if the area of calcium  deposition  is small . At times  US may have  
difficulty  distinguishing calcific  deposits  from  heterotopic  ossification  because both can result  in dense shadowing  
at US. US can be used if there  is concern  for concomitant  rotator  cuff tendon tear and may be a better  modality  than 
MRI in this situation  given the difficulty  of distinguishing  calcium  from  normal  tendon at MRI.

CT arthrograms  have  been  shown  to be an accurate modality  in the assessment  of shoulder  instability  because of  its 
depiction  of osseous,  cartilaginous,  and labroligamentous  injuries  [18,72] . Labral  evaluation  in the postoperative  
setting  may be better  with CT arthrography than MRI  in patients  with metallic  suture  anchors  [73] and has been  
used to evaluate for healing  after superior  labrum  anterior -to-posterior  (SLAP)  repair  [74]. Dual -energy  CT 
arthrography  has a similar  diagnostic  performance  as MR arthrography  [75].

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 15 Chronic Shoulder Pain  Radiography Shoulder  Additional Views  
Glenohumeral  osteoarthritis  is typically  well visualized  on conventional  radiographic  views,  without  the need  for 
special  views.  A standard  axillary  view can demonstrate posterior  subluxation of the humeral  head  and abnormal  
glenoid morphology in patients with severe osteoarthritis  [145-147] . A measurement  of the critical shoulder  angle  
can be drawn  on routine  AP radiographs  by measuring  the angle  between  a line along the glenoid  surface and a line 
from  the inferior glenoid to the lateral  acromial  margin;  patients  with a higher  measurement  may be at high risk of 
having a full thickness rotator  cuff tear [148] .

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  shoulder  pain lasting  >6 months  is a common  presenting  complaint , particularly  in patients  ≥40 years of 
age [1]. Along with a thorough history and physical  examination,  imaging  plays  a critical  role in determining the 
source of chronic  shoul der pain.  Common pain generators in the shoulder  include  the rotator  cuff tendons,  biceps 
tendon,  labrum,  glenohumeral  articular  cartilage,  acromioclavicular  joint, bones,  suprascapular  and axillary  nerves,  
and the joint capsule/synovium.  Imaging  can help to guide  appropriate  therapy , which  can range  from  conservative  
measures such as physical  therapy  and cortico steroid  injections  to more  invasive  procedures  such as arthroscopy or 
surgery . This document  focuses on the imaging approach  to patients  with suspected  chronic  mechanical  shoulder  
pain.

Page Content: Despite  
these limitations, US still provides  an excellent  method  to assess repair  integrity, with a high sensitivity  (80.8%)  
and specificity  (100%)  for recurrent  rotator  cuff tear [158] . The ability  to perform  provocative  maneuvers can 
further demonstrate abnormalities  that other  forms  of imaging  would be incapable  identifying.  
Summary  of Recommendations 
• Variant 1 : Radiography is usually appropriate for the initial imaging of chronic shoulder pain.  
• Variant 2 : US or MR arthrography or MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study 
in the evaluation of chronic shoulder pain when  radiographs are normal or inconclusive and rotator cuff 
disorders or subacromial subdeltoid bursitis (no prior surgery)  is suspected . These procedures are equivalent 
alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage 
the patient’s care).  
• Variant 3 : Image -guided anesthetic +/ - corticosteroid injection  is usually appropriate as the next imaging study 
in the evaluation of chronic shoulder pain when radiographs demonstrate calcific tendinopathy or calcific bursitis. 
• Variant 4 : MR arthrography or MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study in the 
evaluation of chronic shoulder pain when radiographs are normal or inconclusive and labral pathology or shoulder instability is suspected.  These procedures a re equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be 
ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 5 : Image -guided anesthetic +/ - corticosteroid injection or MRI without IV contrast is usually 
appropri ate as the next imaging study in the evaluation of chronic shoulder pain when radiographs are normal 
or inconclusive and adhesive capsulitis is suspected.  These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one 
procedure will be ordered to provide the c linical information to effectively manage the patient’s care). Although 
the panel did not agree on recommending US because there is insufficient medical literature to conclude whether these patients would benefit from the procedure, its use may be appropri ate.

comparable alternative  to MR arthrography in the evaluation  of rotator  cuff tendon tears [16,17] . CT arthrography 
is able to detect  very subtle  articular  surface cuff defects,  but, because of lack of contrast  extension  from  the 
glenohumeral  joint space,  it is less effective at demonstrating bursal  surface or intrasubstance tears,  which  are

Page Content: Although evaluation  of glenoid bony integrity  is typically  better  with CT imaging,  some  practitioners have  used

and Garth  views can demonstrate the anterior  inferior glenoid at a better  advantage  in patients  with a suspected  
Bankart  fracture.  A Stryker  notch  view can sometimes demonstrate  a Hill-Sachs lesion  that is difficult  to see on

Glenohumeral  osteoarthritis  is typically  well visualized  on conventional  radiographic  views,  without  the need  for 
special  views.  A standard  axillary  view can demonstrate posterior  subluxation of the humeral  head  and abnormal  
glenoid morphology in patients with severe osteoarthritis  [145-147] . A measurement  of the critical shoulder  angle  
can be drawn  on routine  AP radiographs  by measuring  the angle  between  a line along the glenoid  surface and a line 
from  the inferior glenoid to the lateral  acromial  margin;  patients  with a higher  measurement  may be at high risk of 
having a full thickness rotator  cuff tear [148] .

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  shoulder  pain lasting  >6 months  is a common  presenting  complaint , particularly  in patients  ≥40 years of 
age [1]. Along with a thorough history and physical  examination,  imaging  plays  a critical  role in determining the 
source of chronic  shoul der pain.  Common pain generators in the shoulder  include  the rotator  cuff tendons,  biceps 
tendon,  labrum,  glenohumeral  articular  cartilage,  acromioclavicular  joint, bones,  suprascapular  and axillary  nerves,  
and the joint capsule/synovium.  Imaging  can help to guide  appropriate  therapy , which  can range  from  conservative  
measures such as physical  therapy  and cortico steroid  injections  to more  invasive  procedures  such as arthroscopy or 
surgery . This document  focuses on the imaging approach  to patients  with suspected  chronic  mechanical  shoulder  
pain.",True

Summary  of Recommendations 
• Variant 1 : Radiography pelvis and Radiography hip are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of chronic 
hip pain. These procedures are complementary (ie, more than one procedure is ordered as a set or simultaneously 
in which each procedure provides unique clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 2 : In the setting of chronic hip pain with negative or nondiagnostic radiographs, MRI hip  without IV 
contrast or US hip  is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for suspected noninfectious extra -articular 
abnormality, such as tendonitis or bursitis.  These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure 
will be ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 3 : In the setting of chronic hip pain with negative or nondiagnostic radiographs, MR arthrography hip 
or MRI hip without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for suspected impingement or 
dysplasia. These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be ordered to provide the

Introduction/Background 
Chronic  hip pain is a common chief  complaint  for patients , reportedly affecting  30% to 40% of adults  who play 
sports  [1,2] , and 12% to 15% of all adults  over 60 [3,4] . A wide variety  of pathological  entities  may cause hip pain, 
including  osseous  as well as intra- or extra -articular  soft tissue abnormalities  [5-7]. Pathology  involving  the lumbar  
spine,  sacroiliac,  or knee  joints  can also cause hip pain [8], and these  etiologies  should  be investigated  as needed . 
There is limited  original  research  that specifically  targets the imaging  of chronic  hip pain,  but imaging  of specific  
conditions  is widely  discussed  in the published  literature.

Prior to the advent of MRI, a bone scan was the preferred test for radiographically occult proximal femoral 
fractures. However, as early as 1993 , Rizzo et al [50] demonstrated MRI to be at least as accurate as bone scan s 
and with substantially decreased time to diagnosis. A later study by  Rubin et al [51] comparing bone scan s and 
MRI demonstrated i mproved sensitivity and specificity of MRI relative to bone scans . Moreover, t he bone scan 
group averaged an additional day to surgery.  
Bone scintigraphy is a time-consuming process. Bone scans may be falsely negative for up to 72 hours from the 
time of in jury, and false-positive scans are likewise common, related to osteoarthritis, soft -tissue injury , or any 
other process that may increase bone turnover [50] . It has been postulated that performing single -photon emission 
computed tomography may combine the sensitivity of bone scintig raphy with the spatial accuracy of CT , but there 
are no data to support this view. In current practice, the role of bone scan s as a secondary line of imaging in 
patients with contraindications to MRI has largely been usurped by CT.  
Summary of Recommendations 
• Variant 1:  Radiographs  of the hip, radiographs  of the pelvis, or radiographs  of the pelvis and hips is usually 
appropriate for the initial imaging of the hip with acute pain, fall or minor trauma, and suspected fracture.  
• Variant 2:  MRI pelv is and affected hip without IV contrast  or CT pelvis and hips without IV contrast is 
usually appropriate as the next imaging study for the evaluation of a cute hip pain from a fall or minor trauma  
with negative radiographs  and suspected fracture.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Fractures of the proximal femur (commonly referred to as hip fractures)  are a frequent  source of morbidity and 
mortality in elderly osteoporotic patients [1]. Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type 
result in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men 
[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs 
will continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of 
life following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays 
in diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -
and long-term mortality [6-13]. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of hip fractures is critical. Hip fractures 
cannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded on the basis of physical exam ination  alone ; therefore , imaging plays a 
key role in early  and accurate diagnosis [14] .",False

FDG -PET/CT  Skull Base to Mid-Thigh 
Reported  results for diagnosing periprosthetic  hip infection  have  been  inconsistent.  In some  investigations, the test 
has been  both sensitive (81% -95%)  and specific (89% -94%)  for infection  [82,86- 90]. The results of other  
investigations ; however,  have  been  less satisfactory,  with sensitivity  and specificity  ranging from  64% to 100%  and 
38% to 68% [91-93]. Delank  et al [94] reported  that although a negative  FDG- PET excludes  infection, a positive  
result  could not accurately  differentiate  infection  from  aseptic inflammation. Kiran  et al [92] performed  preoperative  
FDG-PET/CT on 130 painful  cemented  hip arthroplasties and reported  a sensitivity  of 95% and a specificity  of 38% 
for periprosthetic  infection. In this investigation, the false-positive  rate of FDG  PET/CT compared  with culture  
alone  was 77%.  
Comparisons  of FDG-PET with conventional  nuclear  medicine studies have  been  contradictory.  Some  investigators  
have  reported  that FDG-PET is more  accurate than bone  scintigraphy and labeled  leukocyte  and marrow  imaging,  
whereas other  investigators  have  reported the opposite  results [61,82,87,88,95,96] .

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  hip pain is a common chief  complaint  for patients , reportedly affecting  30% to 40% of adults  who play 
sports  [1,2] , and 12% to 15% of all adults  over 60 [3,4] . A wide variety  of pathological  entities  may cause hip pain, 
including  osseous  as well as intra- or extra -articular  soft tissue abnormalities  [5-7]. Pathology  involving  the lumbar  
spine,  sacroiliac,  or knee  joints  can also cause hip pain [8], and these  etiologies  should  be investigated  as needed . 
There is limited  original  research  that specifically  targets the imaging  of chronic  hip pain,  but imaging  of specific  
conditions  is widely  discussed  in the published  literature. 
Before  imaging,  an appropriate  assessment  of a patient’s  clinical  history  and physical  examination  is essential  in 
trying  to pare down the range  of possible etiologies  for a patient’s  symptoms.

Page Content: Important  historical  details  include  
symptom  duration,  pain patterns (eg, activity  or inactivity  related,  symptomatic  worsening  at night  or in the 
morning),  alleviating  or exacerbating  factors,  and a sensation  of locking or snapping.  On physical  examination,  
assessing  a patient’s  range  of motion,  gait, and pain level  using a variety  of provocative  maneuvers is usually  
performed . Following  a history and physical  examination,  targeted  imaging  can play a vital role in distinguishing  
the etiologies  of a patient’s  symptoms,  thus allowing  appropriate  treatment  of the patient’s  underlying condition . 
Bone  tumors —both malignant  and benign—may  be identified  as part of the initial diagnostic  evaluation  of a patient

Postoperative  greater  trochanter  pain may be due to greater  trochanteric bursitis, or other  etiologies  such as gluteus  
minimus  or medius  tendinitis , or tears or avulsion [73]. Trochanteric bursitis  is reported  to occur  in up to 17% of 
hips after THA and may be related  to the surgical  approach  [144,145] . 
CT Hip 
CT is less optimal  than MRI  for assessing  soft tissues [22]. Fractures and fluid  collections can be identified  on CT. 
Image -Guided Anesthetic +/- Corticosteroid  Injection  Hip Joint  or Surrounding  Structures  
If trochanteric bursitis  is thought  to be a source of pain,  Robbins  et al [144]  suggest  the bursa  may be injected  with 
either  lidocaine  alone  as a diagnostic  test, or in combination with a corticosteroid  as a therapeutic measure.  
MRI Hip 
MRI can be used to assess peritrochanteric structures including  the gluteus  minimus  and medius  muscles,  abductor  
tendons,  and the trochanteric bursa [146,147] . There is no relevant literature documenting the additional benefit of 
MRI with IV contrast, relative to noncontrast MRI, in this population.

Page Content: Pfirrmann  et al [147]  compared  the MRI  findings  about  the greater  trochanter  in 25 patients after primar y THA 
without  pain and 39 patients  with trochanteric pain and abductor  weakness.  Although several  abnormalities  were 
seen in both symptomatic  and asymptomatic groups,  defects of the abductor  tendons  and fatty atrophy of the gluteus  
medius  muscle  and the posterior  part of the gluteus  minimus  muscle  were uncommon in asymptomatic patients.  
Comparison of MRI findings  with findings  at surgical  revision  in 14 patients  confirm ed all MRI tendon findings . 
Joint  distension  and decompression  of synovitis  into the greater  trochanteric bursa  and fluid  undermining the hip 
abductors  can be assessed  on MARS -MRI  [72]. Weber  et al [141]  noted that extracapsular  disease associated  with 
ARMD could be misinterpreted  as trochanteric  bursitis. 
Radiographic  Arthrography  Hip 
Weakness or detachment  of the abductor  muscles may occur  after THA using  an anterolateral  approach  [148] . 
Avulsion of the reattached  gluteus  medius  can provide  a communication between  the hip joint and the trochanteric 
bursa  that can be documented on arthrography [148] . Ylinen  et al [148]  found that all 14 patients  with this 
communication had abductor  avulsion  at revision  surgery.  A negative  study  did not exclude disruption  (sensitivity  
60.1%,  specificity  100%).  The failure  of contrast  to extend to the trochanteric region in these cases was attributed  
to blocking of its flow by a fibrous  capsule.

Page Content: Patellofemoral car tilage loss is also associated with chronic knee pain , with active knee pain correlated with 
BMLs [30,31]. Similar to CT, MRI can calculate various anatomic measurements associated with patellofemoral 
subluxation/dislocation and lateral patellofemoral friction syndrome [32-34]. Bone marrow edema in the classic 
location for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also 
differentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise 
therapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. 
Other etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat 
pad impingement syndromes, Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome, adhesive 
capsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes , 
and osteonecrosis [15, 19,36-45].  
MRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a 
joint effusion. However, contrast -enhanced images ma y be more accurate in diagnosing other causes of chronic 
knee pain , such as Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome, and adhesive 
capsulitis [15].  In particular, enh ancing synovitis thicker than 2 mm in Hoffa’s fat is correlated with peripatellar 
pain [46]. Contrast -enhanced MRI is also useful in quantifying the degree of synovitis and in evaluating 
conditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis [ 17,42,47,48].

Page Content: Severe instability  can result  in 
dislocation. In a 2014 review of 781 cases of prosthesis failure,  Sharkey  et al [12] found that instability  represented  
the third  most  common  cause of prosthesis failure  overall,  accounting  for 7.5%  of all cases.  The concepts of 
instability, malalignment, and loosening in TKA are closely  interrelated  [117] . When  malalignme nt of the joint is 
created  at the time of surgery,  minor  degrees of instability  can become a significant  problem.  By the same  token,  
instability, ongoing over time, can give rise to malalignment, which,  in turn, can lead to loosening.  Although 
ligamentous  balance/imbalance plays  a role in joint instability, it is not the only factor  accounting for stability  [118] . 
3-Phase  Bone  Scan  Knee  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  routine  use of Tc-99m  3-phase bone  scans for the assessment  of instability.  
Bone  scintigraphy may be helpful  in diagnosing loosening,  especially  when  obtained many  years after surgery  [62]. 
This delay  in maximum utility  is because of  the observation that positive  bone  scans are noted in 20% of 
asymptomatic knees 1 year after surge ry and in 12.5%  of individuals  2 years after surgery [61] . Serial  bone  scans 
may be more  helpful  than a single  examination  [119] . Generally,  increased  uptake  on the delayed  images  but not 
on the blood- pool phase is thought  to be due to loosening rather  than to infection  [60]. Normal  scans are most  
helpful  and are characterized  by a high NPV,  indicating  that loosening or infection  is unlikely.  A potential false  
negative ; however,  may occur  if there is loosening at the cement –prosthetic  interface that does not incite  new bone  
formation  [66].

Summary of Literature Review  
Background/Introduction 
Chronic knee pain affects tens of millions of people  in the United States annually , with the pain sometimes highly 
disabling and often negatively impacting the patient’s quality of life. Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and 
it can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain 
with the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. 
Typically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain 
persists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  
imaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated 
that approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the 
prior year) radiographs [2 ]. 
This document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  ≥5 years of age.

or meniscal repair; (4) initial radiograph demonstrates osteoarthritis or chondrocalcinosis; and (5)  initial 
radiograph demonstrates signs of prior (chronic) knee injur y (ie, Segond fract ure, tibial spine avulsion, etc ).  
To evaluat e knee pain associated with other conditions, please refer to the following ACR Appropriateness 
Criteria® topic on:  “Osteonecrosi s of the Hip ” [3] for osteonecrosis,  “Acute Trauma to the Knee ” for acute knee 
injuries  [4], “Imaging After Total Knee Arthroplasty ” for patients with total knee arthroplasty  [5], “Soft-Tissue 
Masses ” for a patient with a suspected soft -tissue mass [6], “Primary Bone Tumors ” for a patient with a suspected 
or known bone tumor [ 7], and “ Chronic Extremity Joint Pain -Suspected Inflammatory Arthritis ” for patient with 
suspected arthritis  or synovitis [ 8]. 
Special Imaging  Considerations  
Knee radiographs  should include at least one frontal projection of one or both knees (anteroposterior, Rosenberg, 
or tunnel), a tangential patellar view , and a lateral view of the affected knee [2,9]. Standing radiographs more 
accurately reflect medial and lateral compartment cartilage loss than supine radiographs with the posteromedial and posterolateral joint compartments  more accurately assessed using a weight -bearing flexion posteroanterior 
radiograph [9,10].

Page Content: Potential host factors  include  preexisting  extraspinal  infection  (endocarditis,  HIV,  pulmonary infection),  
intravenous  (IV) drug use, diabetes mellitus, hepatic or renal  failure,  rheumatologic  disease,  or immunosuppression 
[12,13] . Spine  infection  presents a diagnostic  and management  challenge [14]. Diagnostic delay  is not uncommon  
because of an often  indolent  clinical  presentation  with nonspecific  presenting  signs  and symptoms  such as back  
pain,  fever , and, less commonly,  neurologic  compromise  [3,8,10] . The location  of the spine  infection  is also 
important  because it may influence  the clinical  presentation  and the subsequent  imaging  evaluation.  One or more  
spine  structures and/or  compartments may be infected , and this also influe nces the imaging  findings  [1,14] . Spine  
infection  is often  extradural , initially  invading  the vertebral  endplate  in adults via a hematogenous  route  and 
centering  about  the vertebral  endplate  (osteomyelitis)  and intervertebral  disc (discitis). Spine  infection  may also 
arise initially  within  a facet  joint. Spine  infection  occurs less frequently in children  and initially  affect s the 
intervertebral  disc [15]. Epidural  and paraspinal  soft tissue involvement  are not uncommon [16,17] . Other  important  
clinical  manifestations of spine  infection  with imaging  and management  implications  include  epidural  (abscess) , 
subarachnoid  (meningitis)  space  involvement , or spinal  cord involvement  (myelitis)  [18,19] .

Page Content: The timing  of the imaging  examination  with respect  to when  the spine  intervention  
is performed  is particularly  important, because expected  findings  such as alteration  of soft tissue and osseous  
structures,  edema,  and small  paraspinal  fluid  collections  such as seromas may represent  the normal  sequelae of an 
intervention  shortly  (a few days to weeks)  after the procedure  [28,29,48,69] . 
The body regions  covered  in this clinical  scenario  are the cervical,  thoracic,  and lumbar  spine.  These body regions  
might  be evaluated  separately  or in combination as guided by physical  examination  findings,  patient  history, and 
other  available information.  
CT Spine  Area  of Interest  
CT may be used to assess the spine  for suspected  infection , particularly  following any surgical  or interventional 
procedure,  without  or with spinal  implants  [3,30] . When  initially  considering  the diagnosis  of spine  infection , it is 
importan t to use a combination of clinical presentation  in the context  of these red flags,  abnormal  laboratory values  
such as elevated  ESR and CRP  or leukocytosis,  and abnormal  imaging  findings  [8]. 
In the postoperative spine, CT may show  implant loosening or malpositioning  as well as malalignment  and imaging  
findings  that may be caused  by infection. The addition of IV contrast  increases  the conspicuity of paraspinal  soft 
tissue abnormalities,  such as inflammation  or absces s that may be caused  by infection.  In those  cases in which  a 
contrast -enhanced  CT is to be performed,  it is not necessary  or useful  to perform  a noncontrast -enhanced  CT first, 
because this latter  examination  does not add more  diagnostic  information.

by comparing  the pre- and postcontrast  MRI examinations.  
Radiography Spine  Area  of Interest  
Radiographs  are insensitive  during the early course of spine  infection  [3]. In the subacute or chronic  phase of 
infection , radiographs  can be helpful  in the follow -up evaluation  of the posttreatment  spine  because serial  
radiographic  studies may show  new abnormalities  such as implant  loosening or alteration  in spinal  alignment  that 
might  be caused  by infection  [10].

A 3-phase bone  scan with Tc-99m -MDP  has variable moderate-to -high  sensitivity  (81.4%)  and low specificity  
(40.7%)  for spine  infection  [31]. 
Gallium  Scan  Whole  Body  
Ga-67 scintigraphy combined  with SPECT can be used to evaluate suspected  spine  infection  in patients  who have  
undergone  recent  spine  interventions.  Ga-67 is less sensitive (73%)  but more  specific (61%)  than skeletal  
scintigraphy [31]. A dual Ga-67 and Tc-99m -MDP  study  can increase the overall  specificity  of the examination  to 
81% with a sensitivity  of 73% [3,10,31,36] . This combined study  can be used to assess the postoperative  or 
postprocedure  spine  in cases of suspected  spine  infection  when  MRI  imaging  findings  are equivocal  [3,10]. 
WBC  Scan  and Sulfur  Colloid Scan  Complete  Spine  
A labeled  leukocyte  and sulfur  colloid  study is limited  in the evaluation  of spine  infection  because areas of infection  
often  demonstrate decreased  or absent  radionuclide  uptake  [31].

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 11 Malignant or Aggressive Primary Musculoskeletal Tumor  Radi ography  Area  of Interest  
Not only is radiography  useful  to evaluate  for bone  tumor  recurrence,  but it is also an invaluable  adjunct  to MRI 
interpretation.  When  hardware  is present,  even  with modern  metal -artifact  reduction  techniques,  radiography  can 
visualize  the bone -metal  or bone -cement  interface , which  can be critical  to evaluate  for tumor  recurrence.  
Radiographs  are recommended  for the surveillance  of local  recurrence  of malignant  or aggressive  primary  bone  
tumors.  
US Area  of Interest  
US is not useful  for evaluating  bone  lesions  when  there  is no extraosseous  tumor  extension.  However,  US may be 
beneficial  if a mass  is identified  clinically.  There  is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of US as surveillance  
for asymptomatic  local  recurrence  of malignant  or aggressive  primary  bone  tumors.  
Variant  5: Malignant  or aggressive  primary  soft tissue  tumor.  Surveillance  for local  recurrence.  
The body regions covered in this clinical scenario are abdomen, ankle, chest, elbow,  shoulder , thigh, foot, forearm, 
hand, arm, knee, pelvis, leg, and wrist.  
Local  recurrence  rates  of soft tissue  sarcomas  have  been  reported  to occur  at rates  of 5% to 25% in larger  historic  
studies  [69-72]. Although  rates  of local  recurrence  following  primary  resection  depend  on tumor  histology  and 
grade,  several  other  factors  have  been  identified  that increase  risk.

or issues  of cost-effectiveness  and radiation  dose.  
Special  Imaging  Considerations  
Hardware  reconstruction  is often  needed  following  limb-sparing  surgery  for the management  of bone  tumors  and 
occasionally  for soft tissue  tumors.  This hardware  creates  artifact  and limits  evaluation  of the adjacent  structures  
with traditional  CT, PET/CT , and MRI  sequences  and techniques.  Although  metal  artifact  can negatively  impact  
CT, PET/CT , and/or  MRI  image  quality,  this document  assumes  metal  artifact  can be minimized  with current  metal  
artifact  reduction  protocols.  There  may still be instances  where  metal  artifact  cannot  be sufficiently  suppressed,  and 
CT, PET/CT , and/or  MRI  become  of limited  benefit . In these  cases,  deviations  from  the variant  recommendations  
may be necessary  and should  be informed  by the clinical  experience  and expertise  of the treatment  team.

Summary  of Recommendations  
• Variant  1: CT chest  without  IV contrast  is usually  appropriate  for the initial  staging  of malignant  or aggressive  
primary  musculoskeletal  tumors  in the evaluation  of pulmonary  metastases.  
• Variant  2: FDG -PET/CT  whole  body  is usually  appropriate  for the initial  staging  of malignant  or aggressive  
primary  musculoskeletal  tumors  in the evaluation  of extrapulmonary  metastases.  Although  the panel  did not 
agree  on recommending  MRI whole  body  without  IV contrast  or fluoride  PET/CT  whole  body,  because  there  
is insufficient  medical  literature  to conclude  whether  these  patients  would  benefit  from  the procedure,  its use 
may be appropriate.   
• Variant  3: CT chest  without  IV contrast  is usually  appropriate  for surveillance  of pulmonary  metastasis  in 
patients  with malignant  or aggressive  primary  musculoskeletal  tumors  with no suspected  or known  recurrence.  
• Variant  4: Radiography  area of interest , combined  with MRI  area of interest  without  and with IV contrast  or 
MRI  area of interest  without  IV contrast  are usually  appropriate  for surveillance  of local  recurrence  in patients  
with malignant  or aggressive  primary  bone  tumors.  These  procedures  are complementary,  and both are indicated  
in this patient  population.

Page Content: Local  recurrence  rates  of bone  sarcomas  are reported  to be approximately  10% to 15% 
in patients  with osteosarcoma  and Ewing  sarcoma  [58-61]. Prognosis  is poor for locally  recurrent  malignant  or 
aggressive  bone  tumors,  with postrecurrence  5-year survival  rates  reported  approximately  15% to 30% in patients  
with osteosarcoma  and 5% in patients  with Ewing  sarcoma  [60,62] . Factors  associated  with poorer  prognosis  in 
patients  with osteosarcoma  were  size of local  recurrence  (>5 cm) and presence  of distant  metastasis  [60]. 
Recommendations  for local  recurrence  surveillance  imaging  vary amongst  expert  guidelines,  although  all 
acknowledge  the benefit  of clinical  evaluation.  Locally  recurrent  bone  tumors  can often  present  as a soft tissue  
mass,  and in a study  of osteosarcoma  local  recurrences,  the majority  (approximately  75%)  were  soft tissue  masses  
rather  than bone  lesions  [60]. Some  guidelines  recommend  clinical  exam ination  to be performed  solely , whereas  
others  recommend  in combination  with imaging  [49,51,52,63] . Time  to recurrence  also varies  with tumor  histology.  
Most  osteosarcoma  local  recurrences  have  been  shown  to occur  within  5 years  of resection.  However,  late 
recurrence  of both osteosarcoma  and Ewing  sarcoma  have  been  reported  [60,61] . In a study  of locally  recurrent  
osteosarcoma,  survival  rates  decreased  from  30% at 5 years  to 13% at 10 years,  suggesting  long-term follow -up 
beyond  5 years  is beneficial.

Page Content: FDG -PET/CT  Whole  Body  
A meta -analysis  of FDG -PET/CT  for the staging  of patients  with osteosarcoma  demonstrated  an overall  sensitivity  
of 93% and a specificity  of 97% for detection  of bone  metastases  [6]. Coverage  of a whole  body  FDG -PET/CT  
varies  and usually  extends  either  from  skull  base to thighs  or skull  vertex  to feet. A study  of FDG -PET/CT  in 
patients  with sarcoma  and melanoma  showed  inclusion  of the entire  lower  extremities  does not add additional  
benefit  in identifying  metastases  [31]. 
FDG -PET/CT  is considered  superior  to Tc-99m bone  scan in the detection  of osseous  metastases.  Literature  has 
concluded  this in both general  oncologic  and bone  sarcoma  populations  [30]. FDG -PET/C T is also superior  to CT 
imaging  in this regard.  Quartuccio  et al [22] studied  64 pediatric  patients  with bone  sarcoma  and found  greater  
accuracy  of FDG -PET/CT  (85%  accuracy)  versus  CT (44% accuracy)  in detecting  bone  metastases  during  initial

months  in patients  presenting  with acute LBP compared  with their asymptomatic counterparts , except  in disc 
herniation,  nerve  root compression,  and annular  fissure [15]. Even  in the setting  of disc herniation,  imaging  may 
have  limited  role in management  as the majority  of disc herniations  show  some  degree of reabsorption  or regression

Despite the lack of evidence to support  imaging early  or prior  to conservative treatment  for LBP, there is significant

with anteroposterior  and lateral  radiographs  is useful  for assessing  LBP in patients  with low suspicion  of trauma  or

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 6 Low Back  Pain Table  1. Red Flags : Indications  of a more  complicated  status  include  back  pain/radiculopathy  in the following  
settings  (adapted  from  Bigos et al  [8]). 
Red Flag  Potential  Underlying  Condition  as Cause  of LBP  
• History  of cancer  
• Unexplained  weight  loss 
• Immunosuppression 
• Urinary  infection  
• Intravenous  drug use 
• Prolonged  use of corticosteroids 
• Back  pain not improved with conservative  
management  • Cancer  or infection  
• History  of significant  trauma  
• Minor  fall or heavy  lift in a potentially  osteoporotic  
or elderly  individual  
• Prolonged  use of steroids  • Spinal fracture  
• Acute  onset  of urinary  retention  or overflow  
incontinence  
• Loss of anal sphincter  tone or fecal  incontinence  
• Saddle  anesthesia  
• Bilateral  or progressive  weakness in the lower  
limbs  • Cauda  equina  syndrome  or other  severe neurologic  
condition  
Previous  guidelines  have  suggested  that imaging  be performed  in adults  >50 years of age who present  with LBP. 
When  studied,  there was no statistically  significant  difference in primary  outcome  after 1 year for patients  aged  65 
years or older  who had spine  imaging  within  6 weeks after an initial  visit for care for LBP versus similar  patients  
who did not undergo early  imaging  [9]; thus,  this document  does not include  >50 years of age as an independent  
red flag. However, an important age-related risk factor for spinal fracture presenting as LBP  is osteoporosis.  As 
bone mass decreases slowly over time, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age, and differs by sex, race, 
ethnicity  [10], and comorbidities.

Page Content: In line with the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations for patients  
ages 65 and older being screened for osteoporosis, patients  >65 years of age may be considered at risk for 
osteoporotic fracture when presenting with LBP . 
Additionally,  for those  patients without  neurologic  compromise  and who present  with minor  risk factors for cancer,  
inflammatory  back  disease  (eg, ankylosing spondylitis), vertebral  compression  fracture,  or symptomatic  spinal  
stenosis,  imaging  should be considered  after a trial of therapy  [4]. 
In the majority  of patients, no specific pathology for LBP can be identified. Also,  studies have  shown  imaging  
abnormalities  in a substantial  number  of people  without back  pain [11-13]. The challenge for the clinician, therefore,  
is to distin guish the small  segment  within  this large patient  population that should be evaluated  further because of 
suspicion  of a more  serious  problem  or identify  pathology that requires intervention . 
Other  nonspine  causes of LBP can have overlap  in clinical  presentation,  including inflammatory  arthritis  and other  
systemic conditions , such as pelvic,  renal,  vascular,  or gastrointestinal  etiologies.  If an inflammatory  etiology  is 
suspected  as the cause of LBP, such as ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic  spondylitis, reactive arthritis, or 
inflammatory  bowel  disease– related  spine  disorders,  please see the ACR  Appropriateness Criteria® topic  on 
“Inflammatory Back Pain: Known or Suspected Axial Spondyloarthropathy ” [14].

Summary of Literature Review  
Background/Introduction 
Chronic knee pain affects tens of millions of people  in the United States annually , with the pain sometimes highly 
disabling and often negatively impacting the patient’s quality of life. Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and 
it can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain 
with the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. 
Typically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain 
persists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  
imaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated 
that approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the 
prior year) radiographs [2 ]. 
This document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  ≥5 years of age.

Bone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the 
subchondral bone.  New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or 
patients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee 
pain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the 
origin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. 
Subchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed 
spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to 
elderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs 
often initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, 
and progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is 
suspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria
® 
topic on “ Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae ” [28]. 
Some patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using 
quantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs 
exhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ].

Page Content: Initial imaging.  
A symptomatic primary shoulder arthroplasty has a wide variety of potential etiologies that includ es loosening, 
infection, periprosthetic fracture, and rotator cuff tear. Periprosthetic  fractures of the glenoid  and humerus  can occur  
intraoperatively  as well as postoperatively.  Complications  related  to surgical  technique,  such as excessive  reaming  
or impaction,  are the most  common  reasons for fractures in the intraoperative  setting,  with a reported  incidence of 
2.1%  [6]. In the postoperative setting, a 1% incidence  of periprosthetic  fractures  has been  reported;  patients’  other  
medical  comorbidities  (assessed  using the Deyo -Charlson  index)  are found to be significant  risk factors [10,19] . 
Humeral  fractures  have  been  found to be more  common than glenoid fractures.  Fractures of the acromion  and spine  
of the scapula are more  common  in the setting  of reverse total shoulder  arthroplasty  and are thought  to be related  to 
an intraoperative  complication  or, more  commonly,  chronic  stress [4]. 
3-Phase  Bone  Scan  with  SPECT  or SPECT/CT Shoulder  
There is no relevant literature to support the use of a 3 -phase bone scan with SPECT or SPECT/CT as a first-line 
imaging modality in the acutely symptomatic patient with a primary shoulder arthroplasty.  Similar  to bone  scans,  a 
3-phase bone  scan is highly sensitive for the detection  of periprosthetic  fractures  but suffers  from  low specificity.

suggestive  of abscesses.  Administration  of IV contrast  improves  the evaluation  of adjacent  soft-tissue fluid  
collections/abscesses and sinus  tracts.  
US Shoulder  
US examinations  are increasingly  being  ordered  for evaluation  of periprosthetic  infection  in the setting  of shoulder  
arthroplasty  to evaluate for joint effusion  and surrounding soft-tissue infection. US may be of use for the evaluation  
of a joint effusion,  bursal  distention, and the surrounding soft-tissues  for signs  of infection  including abscesses [40-
42], which  need  aspiration  and testing  to determine the presence of infection  and identification  of the underlying 
microorganism.  US is useful  to evaluate the surrounding  soft tissues  for infection  and to aid in planning  before  
image -guided joint aspiration  in order  to avoid seeding  of a sterile joint effusion  from  overlying soft-tissue infection. 
WBC  Scan  and Sulfur  Colloid Scan  Shoulder  
For infection imaging, In -111 WBC imaging in conjunction with Tc -99m sulfur colloid marrow imaging is a 
sensitive and specific test. An isolated In -111-labeled WBC study is a sensitive but nonspecific technique for the 
evaluation of acute neutrophilic domi nant periprosthetic infection [11] . Its specificity can be increased when 
interpreted alongside Tc -99m sulfur colloid imaging or, less optimally, bone scan imaging; the latter may not be 
indicated if both In -111 WBC and sulfur colloid imaging have been performed [11,21,30] .

Page Content: Radiography Shoulder  
Radiography  is the first and main  imaging  modality  utilized  in the evaluation  of both the symptomatic  and 
asymptomatic shoulder  arthroplasty  [10,13] . Findings on radiographs can be used to diagnose and guide further 
assessment of both osseous and high-grade rotator cuff abnormalities. Radiographs  are particularly  helpful  for the 
detection  of scapular  fractures  that can occur  with relatively  minor  trauma  in patients  with reverse shoulder  
prostheses [24]. 
US Shoulder  
US examinations  are not typically  ordered  as a first -line study for  evaluation  of pain in the setting  of shoulder  
arthroplasty.  Nevertheless,  US provides assessment of the rotator cuff integrity and is  capable of detecting  cortical  
discontinuity and step-off in the setting  of a fracture  after shoulder  arthroplasty  [25]. 
Variant  3: Symptomatic  patient  with  a primary  shoulder  arthroplasty,  infection not excluded. Additional 
imaging following radiographs.  
Infection,  including osteomyelitis  and septic arthritis, after total shoulder  arthroplasty  is an uncommon albeit  
potentially  devastating  complication, with a prevalence of 0.7%  to 2.9% . Infection  is more  common  in males and a 
younger  age group  [3,26,27] . A 97% infection -free  rate at 20 years has been  reported  [28]. Predisposing  underlying 
conditions  may include  rheumatoid  arthritis, corticosteroid  use, diabetes,  repeated  intra-articular  steroid  injections,  
and prior  shoulder  surgery  [26]. 
Infection  rates are higher  in the setting  of reverse total shoulder  arthroplasties,  with a range  of 0.8%  to 10% [29].

Shoulder dislocation or instability is most co mmon in the anterior direction. Younger patients are more likely to 
have labroligamentous injury and persistent instability after dislocation compared with older patients [54]. Older 
patients are more likely to have rotator cuff tears in association with shoulder dislocation [ 55]. Coexisting 
humeral avulsion of the glenohumeral ligament and significant glenoid bone loss have been found in up to 10% of 
patients with recurrent shoulder instability [ 56], which underscores the need to assess both osseous and 
labroligamentous pathology in patients with shoulder dislocation or instability. Glenoid morphology and bone 
loss can play a significant factor in recurrent shoulder dislocations [15, 16,57], which may require bone grafting in 
order to restore stability [ 57].

Appropriately positioned  radiographs can exclude shoulder dislocation and most displaced fractures as the

MRI Shoulder  
Noncontrast MRI is a reasonable imaging study in the setting of acute nonlocalized traumatic shoulder pain and 
noncontributory radiographs. In the acute trauma setting, noncontrast MRI may be preferred to MR arthrography , 
as acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint effusion for assessment of intra -articular 
soft-tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic 
pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [34,35]. MRI is also sensitive for diagnosing bone marrow 
contusion and has  been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries in pediatric patients [ 36,37]. 
MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography has been found to be superior to noncontrast MRI in the diagnosis of labroligamentous and 
partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [17,19]. In the acute trauma setting, however, noncontrast MRI may be 
preferred to MR arthrography because acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Traumatic shoulder pain is shoulder pain believed to be directly attributed to a traumatic event, either acute or 
chronic. This pain may be the result of either fracture (the clavicle, scapula, or proximal humerus) or soft -tissue 
injury (most commonly of the rotator cuff, acromioclavicular ligaments, or labroligamentous complex). The 
incidence of traumatic shoulder injuries is difficult to determine because some injury types, such as low-grade 
acromioclavicular separations or acute rotator cuff tears, are likely under -reported because patients  do not seek 
immediate medical treatment. However, as with many traumatic injuries, traumatic shoulder pain tends to 
disproportionately involve young adults and male patients [ 1,2]. 
The etiology of traumatic shoulder pain can often be made based on clinical examination, radiographs, and 
mechanism of injury. Traumatic shoulder injuries can generally be separated into in juries requiring acute surgical 
management and injuries in which conservative management can be attempted prior to considering surgical 
treatment. Unstable or significantly displaced fractures and joint instability are injuries most likely requiring acute 
surgical treatment.

Page Content: Most soft -tissue injuries (such as labral tears and rotator cuff tears) can undergo a period of 
conservative management prior to considering surgery. However, in addition to the specific imaging findings 
related to a traumatic injury, indications and timing of surgical treatment of many traumatic shoulder injuries are 
dependent on patient age, comorbidities, current activity level, and expected activity level.  
Imaging of chronic shoulder pain is beyond the scope of this topic  and is cove red in the  ACR Appropriateness 
Criteria® on “Shoulder Pain– Atraumatic ” [3]. 
Discussion o f Procedures  by Variant  
Variant 1:  Traumatic shoulder pain. Any etiology . Initial imaging . 
Radiography Shoulder  
Radiographs are the preferred initial study performed in the setting of traumatic shoulder pain . They can delineate 
shoulder malalignment and most shoulder fractures [ 4,5]. A standard set of shoulder radiographs for trauma 
should include at least three  views: anterior -posterior (AP) views in internal and external rotation and an axillary 
or scapula-Y view. Axillary or scapula-Y views are vital in evaluating traumatic shoulder injuries as 
acromioclavicular and glenohumeral dislocations can be misclassified on AP  views [6,7]. Radiographs provide 
good delineation of bony anatomy to assess for fracture and appropriate shoulder alignment, which are the two 
primary concerns in management of acute traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs should also be performed upright 
since malalignment of the shoul der can be under -represented on supine radiographs [ 4]. Additional views, such as 
the Bernageau view, have been sho wn to be effective in demonstrating the degree of bone loss of the glenoid or 
humeral head [ 8]. 
CT Shoulder  
Computed tomography ( CT) is better able than radiogr aphs to characteriz e fracture patterns [ 9-11].

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 10 Shoulder Pain –Traumatic  US Shoulder  
There is no defined role for US  in evaluation of proximal humeral  fractures. Although fractures may sometimes 
be visible on US as areas of cortical interruption, US  is unable to reliably characterize fracture patterns. In ideal 
conditions, US is effective at identifying full-thickness rotator cuff tears that may be associated with humeral head 
fractures [17,22,44]. However, in the acute setting of humeral head fractur e, an US examination of the shoulder is 
significantly limited by decreased patient mobility and swelling. 
FDG -PET/CT  Skull Base to Mid-Thigh 
FDG-PET in combination with CT  has been shown to be reliable in differentiating benign from malignant 
pathologic fr actures [27]. FDG-PET/CT can be used to further assess suspected pathologic fractures of the 
proximal humerus.  
Bone Scan  Shoulder  
Bone scintigraphy has sensitivity and specificity comparable to MRI in diagnosis of occult bone fractures, and 
bone scintigraphy can be used  to identify other foci of bone involvement in pathologic fractures due to metastatic 
disease  [31,32]. Bone scintigraphy can be used  to characterize proximal humerus fractures suspected to be due to 
metastatic disease.  
Variant 4: Traumatic shoulder pain. Radio graphs show scapula fracture.  Next imaging study. 
There is no consensus on indications for surgical fixation of scapula fractures. In general, isolated scapula body 
fractures heal well without surgical fixation, although associated rib fractures or higher injury severity score are 
associated with worse clinical outcomes and may benefit from more aggressive surgical fixation [ 45]. Scapula 
fractures involving the glenoid articular surface or glenoid neck may also require surgical fixation.  
CT Shoulder

Radiography Area  of Interest  
Initial imaging  assessment  of a suspected  musculoskeletal  soft tissue mass  should almost  invariably  begin with 
radiographic  evaluation  and is advocated  by ESMO -EURACAN [9]. Radiographs  remain  the modality  best suited  
for the initial assessment  of a suspected  soft tissue mass  and are the initial study  of choice for orthopedic  oncologists  
[25,26] . However,  radiographs  have  limitations  and may not reveal  an abnormality  when  a mass is small, deep -
seated,  nonmineralized,  or in an area with complex  anatomy  such as the flank,  paraspinal  region,  groin,  or deep  soft 
tissues of the hands  and feet [11]. 
US Area  of Interest  
The diagnostic  accuracy  of US is considerably  less when  lesions outside  the subcutaneous tissue are included.  It is 
also less reliable  for defining deep  masses in large anatomical  areas [27]. Although a recent  prospective  study of 
US accuracy  in the characterization  of 134 histologically  proven  deep  soft tissue masses showed  promising results,  
there were only a small  number  of malignancies in the study cohort , and the investigators  had a high level  of US 
expertise [28].

CT has become a useful  technique  for the evaluation  of patients  who cannot  undergo MRI and is the modality  of

distinguishing vascularized  from  potentially  necrotic regions  of the tumor.  With  modern  CT technology,  
calcification  can usually  be distinguished from  vascular  enhancement.

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
A variety  of benign and malignant  processes may present  clinically  as a soft tissue  mass.  The behavior  of a mass,  
whether  nonaggressive,  indeterminant,  or aggressive,  can often  be discerned  based  on history  and physical  
examination.  However,  when  a benign clinical diagnosis  cannot  be confidently provided,  further  characterization  
of a soft tissue mass  with imaging  is warranted  [1]. Urgent  imag ing requests should be sought  for masses  that are 
>5 cm in diameter,  deep  in location, or have  shown  rapid  growth [2]. Modern imaging  techniques  allow  for a 
detailed  analysis of the morphology  of a soft tissue mass  as well as further insight  into its biologic  activity , which  
informs  the interpreter  on diagnosis  and appropriate  next steps in management  [3,4].  
The purpose  of this document  is to identify  the most  appropriate  imaging  study(ies)  to order  for the assessment  of 
a soft tissue  mass  based  on the most  frequently encountered  clinical  scenarios in medical  practice.

Page Content: Even  when  a specific diagnosis  cannot

US Area  of Interest  
Ultrasound  (US)  has become increasingly  recognized  as an excellent  triage  tool for evaluation  of superficial  soft 
tissue masses [12-15]. This recognition has been  further  supported by a recent  prospective  study of 219 
histologically  proven  masses that showed  US had a sensitivity, specificity, positive  predictive  value,  and negative  
predictive  value  of 93.3%,  97.9%,  45.2%,  and 99.9%,  respectively , for discriminating  benign  from  malignant  
tumors  in the superficial  soft tissues [16]. The same group  of researchers had similar  results in an earlier  separate  
retrospective analysis of 247 histologically  proven  masses [17]. However,  although these results highlight  the 
benefits of US in the initial assessment  of superficial  masses,  the overall  number  of malignancies in both the 
prospective  [16] and retrospective [17] studies was very small  (12 patients  and 11 patients,  respectively).

Radiograph y Foot  
Radiographs  are indicated  by positive  Ottawa rules with 99% sensitivity  in determining  the presence of a foot 
fracture  [1,9,10] . Radiographs  are the mainstay  of initial imaging in the setting  of acute foot trauma.  Initial  
imaging typically  consists of a 3-view study  with the possibility  of additional  views as indicated  by the clinical  
setting  [8]. Additional  views,  such as axial  calcaneal  view,  can be useful  in patients  with suspected  calcaneal  
fracture  [15] because addition of this view  increases specificity  in diagnosing calcaneal  fractures  and sensitivity  in 
distinguishing intra-articular  calcaneal  fractures.  
Lisfranc  Injury  
When  there is a fairly  high clinical  suspicion  of an acute Lisfranc injury,  the foot should be imaged.  In addition  to 
a typical  3-view  radiographic  study  of the foot (anteroposterior  [AP],  oblique,  and lateral),  an AP view with 20° 
craniocaudal  angulation can be added  [16,17] . Although patients  with Lisfra nc sprains may incur  ligamentous  
damage  without  diastasis [18], radiography  should be the initial imaging modality  in the setting  of a suspected  
Lisfranc injury.

Metatarsal -Phalangeal  Joint Injury  
The best initial imaging study  for evaluating  hallux  plantar  plate  disruption  after metatarsal -phalangeal  (MTP)  
joint injury  is weightbearing  AP, lateral,  and sesamoid  axial  views,  with addition  of comparison  radiographs  of 
the contralateral  foot [29].  Radiographs  may also indirectly  evaluate lesser  metatarsophalangeal  plantar  plate  
injury  [30]. The combination  of a positive  drawer  test coupled with transverse deviation  of the third  MTP  joint on 
radiographs  can be used to diagnose  high-grade  plantar  plate  tear of the second  MTP joint [31]. 
A forced  dorsiflexion lateral  view of the hallux  MTP  joint is recommended  if there is clinical  suspicion  of plantar  
plate  injury  of the first MTP joint [29]. 
Radiography Foot  with  Weightbearing  
The best initial imaging study  for evaluating  hallux  plantar  plate  disruption after MTP joint injury  is 
weightbearing  AP, lateral,  and sesamoid  axial  views  with addition  of comparison radiographs  of the contralateral  
foot [29,32] . 
CT Foot  
Studies  report  moderate to poor sensitivity  (25%–33%)  of radiographs  in detection  of midfoot  fractures [21] in 
Level  1 trauma  patients.  A study of 49 patients  with acute hyperflexion injuries  to the foot concluded that 
conventional  radiographs  including  weightbearing  images are not sufficient  for routine  diagnostic  workup and CT 
should serve as the primary  imaging  technique  for such patients  [33]. 
MRI Foot  
MRI is the most  sensitive modality  for the detection  of occult  fracture  and acute bone  stress changes [34,35] .

are negative,  MRI can be obtained in select  patients  with forefoot  pain because of its increased  sensitivity  for the 
early  detection  of metatarsal  head  subchondral  fracture  [54]. 
Lisfranc  Injury  
MRI has been  advocated  as a sensitive diagnostic  test in evaluation  of Lisfranc ligamentous  complex  (especially  
if the patient  is not able to bear weight),  and 3-D volumetric  acquisitions  have  proven superiority  over orthogonal  
proton  density  fat-suppressed  imaging [33,38,41- 45]. There is a high correlation  between  MRI and intraoperative  
findings  for an unstable  Lisfranc injury  [44]. In the patient  with a suspected  Lisfranc injury  and normal  
radiographs,  the literature  supports  further advanced  imaging  by MRI  and CT [21,33,43,46] . 
Turf Toe and Plantar  Plate Injuries 
MRI is the preferred  imaging method for evaluating  suspected  “turf  toe” and lesser  metatarsal  plantar  plate  injury  
by directly  evaluating  the soft-tissue structures of the capsuloligamentous  complex  as well as assessing  chondral  
and osteochondral  lesions [29,55,56] . 
Acute  Tendinous  Rupture  
MRI tends  to be used as a screening  tool when  one is not certain  of the specific tendon injury  or if concomitant  
osseous injury  is suspected.  Both  MRI and US have  been  shown  to be sensitive  for the diagnosis  of acute tendon  
rupture  or dislocation  in the foot [39].

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Acute injuries  to the foot are frequently  encountered  in the setting  of the emergency  room  and in general  practice.  
The clinical  indications  for imaging  (known as the Ottawa rules)  have  been  developed  to minimize  unnecessary  
radiographs , and their utility  is well documented by multiple  studies.  The most  commonly  accepted  form  of these  
rules is the following:  
A series of foot radiographs  is required  only if there  is pain in the midfoot  and any one of the 
following:  1) point  bone  tenderness of the navicular;  2) point  bone  tenderness of the base of the fifth 
metatarsal;  or 3) inability  to bear weight  or to walk  4 steps (immediately  after the injury  or at the 
emergency  department) .",False

Page Content: Furthermore, MRI may als o demonstrate other reasons for occult pelvic pain, such as soft -tissue abnormalities or 
the subchondral hip or supra -acetabular stress fractures described in some osteoporotic patients [63]. The clinical 
differential diagnosis includes sacroiliitis from inflammatory or infectious causes, osteitis condensans ilii, and 
lumbosacral degenerative spondylosis  [60]. 
Variant 12: Suspect stress (fatigue or insufficiency) fracture of the long bones . Pregn ant patient. 
See variant 11. In the case of long bones, the fetus’ absorbed dose from radiography and CT will be substantially 
lower. Women can be reassured that benefit far outweighs the risk wi th regard to diagnostic imaging, as all 
radiographs and CT sc ans not involving the abdomen or pelvis hav e a predicted fetal absorbed dose of less than 1 
mGy  [80]. Radiographs should be the initial imaging evaluation because findings may be conclusive , in which 
case no further imaging should be performed. MRI does not use ionizing radiation and can  be used  as necessary to 
make the diagnosis.  
Summary of Recommendations  
• In the setting of a suspected fatigue fracture, the initial imaging test should be radiography of the area of 
interest, although it is not a sensitive examination. 
• If there is clinical concern  for a fatigue fracture of the hip and initial radiographs are negative, MRI without 
contrast should be performed because of the high risk of complications.  
• In the setting of a suspected fatigue fracture in a location other than the hip with initial negati ve radiographs, 
either repeat radiographs in 10  to 14 days or MRI without contrast may be appropriate depending on the 
location of pain and relative risk of complications secondary to stress fractures in that area.  
• If there is an immediate need -to-know sit uation to diagnose a stress fracture in the setting of negative 
radiographs, for example,  professional football player, then MRI w ithout contrast is recommended.

Page Content: • MRI without contrast and potentially total-body DXA provide prognostic information, which may help initial 
return -to-play evaluations.  
• Although insensitive, radiographs should be the initial imaging study of choice for suspected insufficiency 
fractures in the pelvis or hip.  
• When initial radiographs are negative in the setting of suspected insuffici ency fracture of the pelvis or hip, 
MRI without contrast is recommended, and CT without contrast remains a reasonable, less sensitive 
alternative.  
• Although insensitive, radiographs are the recommended initial imaging procedure for suspected insufficiency 
fractures in the lower extremities (excluding the pelvis and hip) .

Page Content: Furthermore, certain athletic activities often result in specific sites of fatigue  fracture, such as olecranon process 
fractures in javelin throwers and baseball pitchers, proximal femur and tibial stress fractures in runners, and  tarsal  
navicular stress fractures in basketball players [ 36-38] . Correlat ion of  clinical history, pattern , and site recognition 
with radiographic findings  is usually specific [1,2,4,5,7]. Nevertheless, stress fractures are frequently occult on 
initial radiographs  [1], with conventional radiographs having a sensitivity of 15% to 35% [8]. Early radiographic 
findings are often nonspecific (subtle periosteal reaction , gray cortex sign) or even nonexistent. Late radiographic 
findings are often suggestive in appearance  and include  linear sclerosis (often perpe ndicular to the major 
trabecular lines), periosteal reaction , patchy endosteal sclerosis, and soft -tissue swelling . Additionally, 
radiographs may remain negative depending on the timing of re imaging , the patient’s metabolic bone status, and 
the type and lo cation of the fracture. Thus, radiographs are specific but significantly insensitive. Despite this 
limitation, all authorities agree that radiographs should be the initial imaging modality; if the findings are 
conclusive, no further imaging need be perform ed. 
Variant 2: S uspected stress (fatigue) fracture, hip. Negative radiographs. Next imaging study.   
Short -term (10  to 14 days) follow -up radiographs are more sensitive than initial radiographs secondary to overt 
bone reaction in the location of the stress fracture. Follow -up radiographic sensitivity increases to 30 % to 70%

Page Content: Finally, stress fractures of the femoral head are high  risk in healthy patients and , if not recognized promptly, have 
increased  rates of delayed union, nonunion, displacement, and avascular necrosis [17]. Given the importance of 
recognizing these high-risk fractures in the femoral head and neck, MRI is the preferred second -line study after  
initial negative  radiographs to prevent delayed diagnosis.  
Variant 3: Suspected stress (fatigue) fracture, excluding hip  and vertebrae. Negative radiographs. Next 
imaging study.  
See variant 2. Certain stress fractures are considered high  risk based on a tendency for nonunion or delayed union. 
High -risk stress fractures include the anterior tibial diaphysis, lateral femoral neck and femoral head (see variant 
2), patella, medial malleolus, navicular, fifth metatarsal base, proximal second metatarsal, tibial hallux sesamoid, 
and talus  [43]. 
The second -line test to diagnose a stress fracture should be guided by the location of the patient ’s pain and 
likelihood of high-risk injury. A follow -up radiographic examination has increased sensitivity compared to initial 
radiographs [8] but is less sensitive than MRI. MRI is extremely sensitive and demonstrates stress abnormalities 
as early as bone scintigraphy and with as much sensitivity [ 11-14]. The recent literature favors MRI as the 
procedure of choice for making an early diagnosis of both varieties of stress fractures [ 15-28 ]. MRI is also 
considerably more specifi c than bone scintigraphy [ 19,23]. Stress injuries in athletes that are not identified and 
managed in a timel y fashion can progress to more serious fractures. Preventive strategies, including identifying 
and modifying risk factors, may help deter progression to frank fractures [31,44,45]. 
A circumstance that deserves specific attention is the longitudinal stress fracture, particularly in the tibia. Up to 
25% may appear n ormal on radiographs, but CT or MRI findings are characteristic [ 13,46].

to-play” evaluation . 
See variants 1  through  3. On initial diagnosis, MRI can be used to  predict t ime to return to play in athletes. 
Fredericson et al  [48] retrospectively correlated return to activity with an MRI grading system based on the 
pattern of periosteal and marrow edema on T1-weighted  and fat -suppressed T 2-weighted sequences. Similar 
findings were confirmed in other studies  [49-51] , including  that the finding of abnormal cortical signal intensity 
or a fracture line was of prognostic value [ 51] and that MRI performed better in predicting return to activity than 
radiographs , bone scintigraphy, or CT [50,52]. 
A recent prospective study in university athletes found that MRI grading s everity, total-body bone mineral density 
evaluated by dual -energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and location of injury (ie , cortical or trabecular bone)  
were important variables for predicting time to full return to sport [ 31]. In this study, periosteal edema as 
described by Fredericson et al [ 48] was not associated with return to sport . Using the modified grading scale and a 
multiple regression model, for every 1- unit increase in MRI grade, the time to full return to sport increased by 
approximately 48 days [31] . Furthermore, trabecular st ress injuries (eg , femur neck and pubic bone ) were 
associated with a longer time to return to sport than cortical bone stress injuries. In addition, decreased bone 
mineral density leads to increased time to return to sport . Therefore, bone mineral density provides additional 
diagnostic and prognostic information [31]. The model of MRI  grade, trabecular versus cortical bone sit e, and 
total-body bone mineral density a ccounted for 68% of the variation in time to return to sport [ 31].",False

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic foot pain is a frequent clinical complaint with approximately 14% to 42% of adults in the United States 
reporting foot problems, often with significant impact on mobility, difficulty performing daily activities , and 
increased risk of falling, particularly in older individuals [1,2] . Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a 
significant improvement in health-related quality of life with effective treatment of foot pain [3] . Estimating the 
prevalence of chron ic foot pain is challenging, because there is no consensus regarding the definition of chronic 
pain in the literature. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines chronic pain as any pain persisting 
past the normal healing time, suggesting 3 months in case of chronic pain of benign causes.  
Women are more commonly affected , and forefoot conditions are more frequent. Persistent pain for more than 6  
years has been reported in 51% of women between 70 to 75 years of age [4]. Because of  the wide range of causes 
of chronic foot pain, assessment of these patients with imaging studies in addition to a dedicated clinical 
examination is often needed [1] .

Page Content: The guidelines of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons divide heel pain into plantar heel pain,  usually 
related to pathology of the plantar fascia, and posterior heel pain,  usually related to pathology of  the Achilles tendon, 
and treatment options vary from nonoperative treatments to surgical procedures [5] . 
Chronic foot pain in children, symptoms related to soft -tissue or bone neoplasms and pain related to infectious 
conditions, inflammatory arthropathies, or other systemic diseases are beyond the scope of this document. 
Evaluation of patients with neuropathic foot or Charcot arthropathy is addressed in the ACR Appropriateness 
Criteria® topic on “ Suspected Osteomyelitis of the Foot in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus ” [6]. Posttraumatic 
entities affecting the ankle,  including instability, arthrosis, osteochondral defects, osteonecrosis, and tendinop athies,  
are discussed in  ACR Appropriateness Criteria® topic on “Chronic Ankle Pain ” [7]. Infectious and inflammatory 
arthropathies are discussed in ACR Appropriateness Criteria® topic s on “Suspected Osteomyelitis, Septic Arthritis, 
or Soft Tissue Infection (Excluding Spine and Diabetic Foot) ” [8] and “ Chronic Extremity Joint Pain –Suspected 
Inflammatory Arthritis ” [9]. Acute traumatic in juries of the foot including Lisfranc injuries are discussed in  ACR

The likelihood  of developing osteomyelitis  without  an associated  wound or ulceration  is extremely  low. Almost  
all osteomyelitis  and soft-tissue abscesses of the diabetic  foot represent  areas of contiguous  infection  from  
adjacent  skin ulcerations and not hematogenous  seeding  [14]. Any imaging modality  performed  for this variant  
should be able to identify  soft-tissue infections,  tumors  and abscesses,  early  neuropathic  arthropathy,  or subtle  
fractures not revealed  on initial radiographs . Diabetic foot osteomyelitis  and neuroarthropathy  can be difficult  to 
differentiate  clinically.  The early  diagnosis  of neuropathic  disease prior  to the development  of radiographic  
change  is important, as these  patients  will be treated  with altered  footwear  and orthotics  to prevent  the progression  
to deformity.

Summary of Literature Review 
Introduction/Background 
Cervical Spine Imaging An estimated 3% to 4% of patients presenting to the emer gency department with blunt trauma have sustained an 
injury to the cervical spine [1,2]. Cervical spine injuries can range from stable minor soft-tissue injuries to 
unstable complex injury patterns resulting in complete disr uption of the cervical spine with possible neurologic or 
vascular injury. The wide spectrum of injury patterns can make the decision process for when to perform imaging 
and what type of imaging to perform challenging. Over utilization of MRI and CT imaging of the cervical spine 
can result in an extended emergency center visit while aw aiting imaging as well as iatrogenic injuries related to 
prolonged cervical collar placement [3], exposure to in travenous (IV) contrast, and exposure to radiation and 
high-power magnetic fields. On the other hand, failure to  identify an unstable cervical spine or cervical vascular 
injury can result in poor clinical outcomes.

Cervical spine CT is the preferred modality for the initia l assessment of cervical spine injury. However, CT is 
significantly inferior to MRI in identifying many soft-tissu e pathologies, such as spinal cord contusion, epidural 
hematoma, and nerve root avulsions, that can cause neur ologic deficits and require surgical intervention 
[40,41,43,57]. Therefore, CT should not be considered ad equate for excluding significant soft-tissue pathology in 
patients presenting with signs or symptoms of cervical spinal cord or  nerve root injury.

Page Content: Furthermore, MRI has been found to have low (64% to 77%) specificity in identifying clinically significant 
interspinous ligament, intervertebral disc, and paraspinal muscle injury [62]. 
While not limited to obtunded patients, recent prospectiv e multicenter trials suggest that MRI has a role in 
evaluating patients who have a negative cervical spine CT. The Western Trauma Association Multi-Institutional 
trial reported that CT was effective for ruling out clinically  significant injury with a sensitivity of 98.5%. A small 
but clinically significant incidence of a missed injury was noted [56]. The prospective ReCONECT trial studied 
767 patients who had a negative cervical spine CT and we nt on to MRI because of cervicalgia (43.0%), inability 
to evaluate (44.1%), or both (9.4%). MRI was abnormal in 23.6% of all patients, including ligamentous injury 
(16.6%), soft-tissue swelling (4.3%), vertebral disc injury  (1.4%), and dural hematomas (1.3%). The patients with 
abnormal MRI were less likely to have their cervical colla r removed than those with normal MRI (13.3% versus 
88.1%). Eleven patients underwent cervical spine surgery af ter the MRI results. The clin ical significance of these 
abnormal MRI findings could not be determined from this study group [55]. By inference, it is likely that some 
obtunded patients with negative cervical spine CT will have abnormal MRI, and some of these MRI-detected 
injuries may require treatment.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 12 Suspected Spine Trauma However, there are no widely accepted criteria for grading th e severity of cervical spine soft-tissue injury on MRI, 
and while MRI has been shown to have high sensitivity fo r identifying soft-tissue inju ries of the cervical spine, 
the specificity of MRI for identifying clinically signifi cant cervical soft-tissue injuries is only modest. In a 2015 
study by Zhuge et al [62], MRI demonstrated 100% sensitiv ity for diagnosis of injury to the cervical paraspinal 
muscles, intervertebral disc, and interspinous ligament but  with specificities of only 77%, 71%, and 64% for these 
structures, respectively. Therefore, care should be taken in  interpretation of soft-tissue injuries identified on MRI. 
Variant 5: Age greater than or equal to 16 years. Susp ected acute cervical spine blunt trauma. Clinical or 
imaging findings suggest arterial injury with or wi thout positive cervical spine CT. Next imaging study. 
Arterial injury can be a concern in blunt and penetrating spinal injury. An estimated 1% to 3% of blunt trauma 
patients are diagnosed with cerebrovascular injury  [63,64]. These injuries can include transection, 
pseudoaneurysm formation, and simple dissection. Di ssections and pseudoaneurysms  may or may not produce 
stenosis and flow limitation of the affected artery. The presence of dissection in itself is generally taken to 
represent a risk of thrombus forma tion and subsequent embolization. 
Many different head and neck injury patterns and c linical symptoms have been associated with blunt 
cerebrovascular injuries (BCVIs) [52,53,63-68]. Up to two-th irds of patients with BCVIs may be asymptomatic at 
presentation [65] and not develop stroke-like symptoms for 48 to 72 hours after initial blunt trauma injury [63,64]. 
Screening for BCVI is ideally performed  to appropriately initiate anticoagul ation therapy prior to the patient 
developing neurologic deficits.

Variant 9: Age greater than or equal to 16 years. Blunt trauma meeting criteria for thoracic and lumbar 
imaging. Initial imaging. 
Imaging is a crucial component in assessment of thoracic and lumbar spine injury. Fr om 1998 to 2011, there was 
an adjusted annual increase of approximately 8% in thor acolumbar spine fractures in patients involved in motor 
vehicle collisions [15]. Thoracolumbar fractures are cha llenging to identify clinically, with only 48% to 75% of 
thoracolumbar injuries identified on clinical examination [16-18]. Unlike cervical injuries, well-defined clinical 
criteria have not been established to determine when thor acolumbar imaging is appropriate in the setting of blunt 
traumatic injury. Since clinical examination has poor sen sitivity for identifying thoracolumbar injuries, any high-
risk patient (mid line thoracolumbar tenderness, high-energ y mechanism of injury, or >60 years of age), as well as 
unexaminable patients (intoxicated, GCS <15, distracting injury), should undergo imaging of the thoracolumbar 
spine. Screening of the entire spine is advised, as an es timated 20% of spine injuries will have a second associated 
spinal injury at a noncontiguous level [26,27]. 
Radiography  Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
It is well established that CT outperforms radiographs in  the diagnosis of thoracolumbar spine fractures [104-
108]. Radiographs have a reported sens itivity of 49% to 62% for identifying thoracic spine fractures and 67% to 
82% sensitivity for identifying lumbar spine fractures [ 104,107,108] compared with the reported sensitivity of 
94% to 100% for identifying thoracolumbar spine fract ures using CT [104,107,108].

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 7 Suspected Spine Trauma spine should also be maintained for patients with di sease processes known to cause spin e rigidity, such as diffuse 
idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis or ankylosing spondylitis. 
A comprehensive literature review of thoracolumbar trau ma was performed by Hsu et al [19] in 2003 with the 
conclusion that patients should undergo im aging of the thoracolumbar spine if  the following criteria were present: 
(1) back pain or midline tenderness, (2) local signs of thoracolumbar injury, (3) abnormal neurological signs, (4) 
cervical spine fracture, (5) Glasgow Coma  Scale score (GCS) <15, (6) major distracting injury, or (7) alcohol or 
drug intoxication. A prospective study by Holmes et al [20] of 152 patients with thoracolumbar spine injury in 2003 found 100% negative predictive value for thoracolumbar spine injury in patients not meeting any of the 
following criteria: (1) complaints of thoracolumbar spine pain, (2) thoracolumb ar spine tenderness, (3) a 
decreased level of consciousness, (4) intoxication with etha nol or drugs, (5) a neurologic deficit, or (6) a painful 
distracting injury. A prospective study of over 3,000 adult blunt trauma patients performed by Inaba et al [21] in 
2015 found 98.9% sensitivity for identifying patients with clin ically significant thoracolumbar spine injury using 
the following criteria: (1) positive physical examination (i ncluding neurologic deficit), (2) high-risk mechanism of 
injury, and (3) ≥60 years of age. It should be noted that in the study by Inaba et al, patients with altered 
consciousness (GCS <15), intoxication, or painful distrac ting injury were excluded from analysis because of their 
inability to perform an adequate examination necessitating imaging clear ance of the thoracolumbar spine. 
However, none of these 3 proposed criteria have  been validated independently (Table 4).

spine with additional “swimmer’s lateral” view of the upper thoracic spine if this region is obscured by the 
overlying shoulders. 
CT Myelography Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
There is no role for CT myelography in the in itial assessment of thoraco lumbar spine injury. 
CT Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
CT is the gold standard for identifying fractures of the t horacolumbar spine with a reported sensitivity of 94% to 
100% [104,107-110]. In addition to identifying thoracolumbar spine injuri es, CT is excellent for delineating soft-
tissue injuries of the chest, abdomen, and pelvic regi on that often accompany spinal fractures. However, CT 
imaging of the thoracolumbar spine is more commonly pe rformed as part of CT evaluation of the entire thorax, 
abdomen, and pelvis in trauma patients with high index of suspicion for soft-tissue injuries or who cannot be 
cleared by clinical examination. It is debated whethe r dedicated reformatted images using collimated field-of-
views centered on the thoracolumbar spine with dedicated  “hard kernel” image algorithms are more accurate for 
identifying bony pathology. Recent studi es indicate that identification of thoracolumbar spine fractures on routine 
thoracic, abdomen, and pelvic CT imaging using routine body large fields of view and “soft kernel” image 
algorithms is comparable to dedicated thoracolumbar spine reformatted images. Se nsitivity of thoracolumbar 
spine fracture detection using routine body imaging prot ocols has been reported at 94% to 99% compared with 
97% to 99% sensitivity using dedicated thoracolumbar spin e protocols with no statistically significant difference 
in sensitivity between the two protocols [109,110].

CT Myelography Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
CT myelography can be performed to assess for traumatic spinal canal narrowing that is due to disc herniation or 
epidural hematoma and to assess for preganglionic nerve root avulsions. Ho wever, as with conventional CT, CT 
myelography is inferior to MRI in assessing cord contus ion, cord hemorrhage, and postganglionic nerve root 
injuries [40,41,43,57]. Performance of thoracolumbar CT myelogram can also be technically challenging, 
particularly in patients with suspected  unstable thoracolumbar spine injury. 
CT Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
CT does play a role in the initial assessment of thoracic and lumbar spine injury. However, CT is significantly 
inferior to MRI in identifying many soft-tissue pathologies,  such as cord contusion, epidural hematoma, and nerve 
root avulsions that can cause neurologic deficits re quiring surgical intervention [40,41,43,57]. Therefore, CT 
should not be considered adequate for excluding signifi cant soft-tissue pathology in patients presenting with 
thoracolumbar spine trauma and neurologic deficit. 
MRI Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
MRI should be performed in patients who have possible spinal  cord injury, in whom there is clinical concern for 
cord compression that is due to disc protrusion or hema toma, and in those suspected of ligamentous instability. 
MRI is valuable for characterizing the cause of myelopathy in  patients with spinal cord  injury. The severity of the 
injury—including extent of intramedullary hemorrhage , length of edema, and evidence of cord transection—
contributes to predicting outcome.

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
In the United  States,  acute low back  pain (LBP),  with or without radiculopathy , is the leading  cause of years lived  
with disability  and the third  ranking cause of disability -adjusted  life years  [1]. It is the fifth most  common  reason  
for a physician  visit in the United  States  and accounts for approximately  3% of visits  to the emergency  department  
[2]. 
The American  College  of Physicians and the American  Pain Society  classify  LBP into the following  broad  
categories:  nonspecific LBP, back  pain potentially  associated  with radiculopathy or spinal  stenosis,  and back  pain 
potentially  associated  with another  specific spinal  cause [3].

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 11 Low Back  Pain Discography  and Post-Discography  CT Lumbar  Spine  
Although the utility  of discography in patients  with LBP remains  controversial,  a systematic review by Manchikanti  
et al [32] provides  level  III evidence that lumbar  discography may be useful  in patients  with chronic  discogenic  
LBP. 
FDG -PET/CT  Whole  Body  
There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of whole -body FDG-PET/CT in the evaluation  of a surgery  or 
intervention  candidate with persistent  or progressive  symptoms  during  or following 6 weeks of conservative  
management  [28-30]. 
MRI Lumbar Spine With IV Contrast  
MRI lumbar  spine  with IV contrast  is not typically  performed  independently as an initial study,  as its interpretation  
is most  informative  when  correlated  with standard  noncontrast  sequences included in MRI lumbar  spine  with and 
without  IV contrast  [33]. 
MRI Lumbar Spine Without and With IV Contrast  
MRI with IV contrast  is typically  not necessary  in the evaluation  of a surgical  or interventional candidate with 
persistent  or progressive  symptoms  during or following  6 weeks of conservative management  but is sometimes  
useful  if noncontrast  MRI is nondiagnostic  or indeterminate.  Contrast  can help distinguish  residual/recurrent  disc 
from  fibrosis/scar  in a postoperative  patient  (see Variant  5). 
MRI Lumbar Spine Without IV Contrast  
Patients  presenting  with subacute or chronic  LBP or radiculopathy  who have  failed  6 weeks of conservative therapy , 
and with physical  examination  signs  of nerve  root irritation , should  be imaged  if they are believed  to be candidates 
for surgery  or intervention  or if diagnostic  uncertainty  remains.  Accurate diagnosis  of disc disease can be provided  
by MRI [7].

Page Content: A prospective  cohort  study of 20 patients  showed  no significant differences in MRI changes over 12 
months  in patients  presenting  with acute LBP compared  with their asymptomatic counterparts , except  in disc 
herniation,  nerve  root compression,  and annular  fissure [15]. Even  in the setting  of disc herniation,  imaging  may 
have  limited  role in management  as the majority  of disc herniations  show  some  degree of reabsorption  or regression  
by 8 weeks after symptom onset  [16]. It is important  to note that repeat  imaging  in patients  with new episodes of 
LBP and previous  MRI scans are unlikely  to detect  differences in disc protrusion,  annular  fissures,  high-intensity  
zones,  or end-plate  signal  changes [13]. 
Despite the lack of evidence to support  imaging early  or prior  to conservative treatment  for LBP, there is significant  
variation  in the ordering practices of physicians,  with nonadherance  to guidelines  leading  to increased  health  care 
utilization  [17,18] . A retrospective cohort  study of 145,320  patients ≥66 years of age  with acute nonspecific  LBP, 
revealed  27.2%  received  radiography  and 11.1%  received  CT or MRI within  4 weeks of the initial primary  care 
provider  visit [18]. A prospective  population-based  cohort  study  of 1,770 patients  with acute occupational  LBP 
showed  that 336 (19.0%)  received  lumbar  MRI within  6 weeks of presentation  (nonadherent  to guidelines).  This 
nonadherent  group had an increased  likelihood  of lumbosacral  injections  or surgery  for outpatient, inpatient, and 
nonmedical  services,  and disability  compensation  [17]. Increased  health  care utilization  with early  imaging  has also 
been  demonstrated  in nonworker  populations  [6].

Previous  guidelines  have  suggested  that imaging  be performed  in adults  >50 years of age who present  with LBP. 
When  studied,  there was no statistically  significant  difference in primary  outcome  after 1 year for patients  aged  65 
years or older  who had spine  imaging  within  6 weeks after an initial  visit for care for LBP versus similar  patients  
who did not undergo early  imaging  [9]; thus,  this document  does not include  >50 years of age as an independent  
red flag. However, an important age-related risk factor for spinal fracture presenting as LBP  is osteoporosis.  As 
bone mass decreases slowly over time, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age, and differs by sex, race, 
ethnicity  [10], and comorbidities.

Page Content: In line with the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations for patients  
ages 65 and older being screened for osteoporosis, patients  >65 years of age may be considered at risk for 
osteoporotic fracture when presenting with LBP . 
Additionally,  for those  patients without  neurologic  compromise  and who present  with minor  risk factors for cancer,  
inflammatory  back  disease  (eg, ankylosing spondylitis), vertebral  compression  fracture,  or symptomatic  spinal  
stenosis,  imaging  should be considered  after a trial of therapy  [4]. 
In the majority  of patients, no specific pathology for LBP can be identified. Also,  studies have  shown  imaging  
abnormalities  in a substantial  number  of people  without back  pain [11-13]. The challenge for the clinician, therefore,  
is to distin guish the small  segment  within  this large patient  population that should be evaluated  further because of

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
In the United  States,  acute low back  pain (LBP),  with or without radiculopathy , is the leading  cause of years lived  
with disability  and the third  ranking cause of disability -adjusted  life years  [1]. It is the fifth most  common  reason  
for a physician  visit in the United  States  and accounts for approximately  3% of visits  to the emergency  department  
[2]. 
The American  College  of Physicians and the American  Pain Society  classify  LBP into the following  broad  
categories:  nonspecific LBP, back  pain potentially  associated  with radiculopathy or spinal  stenosis,  and back  pain 
potentially  associated  with another  specific spinal  cause [3].

Page Content: Although infrequent,  spinal  cord ischemia can result  in acute onset  myelopathy and in adults  is most  commonly  the 
result  of atheromatous  disease  or as a complication  of aortic  surgery  [3]. Other  pathologies  that may predispose  
patients  to developing spinal  cord ischemia include  systemic hypotension,  thoracoabdominal  aneurysms or 
dissection , sickle cell disease,  and spinal  arteriovenous  malformations  (AVM s) [27,28] . Very  rarely,  patients  may 
develop hematomyelia and subsequently acute myelopathy because of an intrameduallary  AVM  or spinal  artery  
aneurysm  rupture  [29,30] . Acute ischemic myelopathy can also develop in the setting  of fibrocartilaginous  embolic  
disease [31]. Depending on the level(s)  of the spinal  cord involved,  patients  will typically  develop acute paraparesis 
or quadriparesis.  Inflammatory  conditions  that can result  in acute myelopathy include  demyelinating  diseases such 
as multiple  sclerosis (MS),  neuromyelitis  optica  (NMO),  and acute disseminated  encephalomyelitis (ADEM) ; 
systemic inflammatory  conditions  such as systemic lupus  erythematous,  Sjogren  syndrome,  mixed  connective  tissue  
disorder,  Behcet  disease,  and sarcoidosis;  and infectious  diseases [8]. 
MRI Spine 
MRI is useful  for evaluation  of the spinal  cord when  investigating  the etiology  of acute myelopathy [32]. MRI  has 
superior  soft-tissue resolution  and multiplanar  capability , making  it ideal  for evaluation  of the spinal  canal  and its 
contents  as well as the surrounding osseous and soft-tissue structures [13-15,33-36] .

Page Content: MS is the classic demyelinating 
disease and is characterized  by lesions affecting  the spinal  cord (and brain)  and clinical  defects disseminated  in 
space and time [61]. Spinal cord involvement  is seen in 80% to 90% of patients  with MS, most  commonly affecting  
the cervical  cord [62]. Patients  with primary  progressive  MS tend to have  more  spinal  cord involvement  than 
patients  with relapsing -remitting  MS [12]. When myelopathy due to MS is suspected,  MRI detection  of spinal  cord 
lesion(s)  fulfills  part of the 2016 Magnetic Resonance Imaging in MS (MAGNIMS ) criteria  [63]. NMO  is a 
demyelinating  condition characterized  by optic  neuritis  and spinal  cord lesions.  Brain  lesions are not as commonly  
encountered  in NMO as in MS, so, when  present , tend to predominate  in regions  around the third  and fourth  
ventricles [64-66]. ADEM  is a demyelinating  condition that typically  manifests as encephalopathy.  Spinal  cord 
involvement  is present  in approximately 25% of cases of ADEM . MRI of the spine  is generally  considered  the 
reference standard  for imaging  of the spinal  cord in cases of suspected  demyelinating  disease [63,67,68]  in addition  
to excluding alternative  etiologies.  Contrast -enhanced  imaging  is recommended  for initial diagnostic  evaluation  
[69,70] . 
MRA Spine 
There is no relevant  literature  regarding the use of MR angiography (MRA ) in the initial imaging  evaluation  of 
acute onset  myelopathy.  In cases of spinal  cord ischemia,  MRA  can be used to identify  the artery  of Adamkiewicz  
or vertebral  artery  dissection/occlusion  and should  be considered  as a follow -up to MRI [12].

Metabolic  causes of chronic  or progressive  myelopathy result  in changes in the spinal  cord known  as subacute 
combined degeneration  and are best evaluated  with MRI [11,83,84] . Chronic  infections  can have  a similar  
appearance [12].  
Radiation -induced  myelopathy is a rare dose-dependent  complication  that anatomically  localizes to a prior  radiation  
port [85]. Autoimmune  myelitis  includes  paraneoplastic myelopathy [86,87] . MRI  without  and with IV contrast  is 
useful  to evaluate the spinal  cord in these instances.  
Vascular  malformations  can likewise present  with chronic  and slowly  progressive  myelopathy [88]. MRI without  
and with IV contrast  is useful  to demonstrate spinal  cord edema  caused  by venous  hypertension and enlarged  veins  
along the dorsal  surface of the spinal  cord.  There may be patchy  intramedullary  enhancement  due to breakdown  of 
the blood-cord  barrier.  In some  cases,  abnormal  vasculature may be identified  that may be useful  to guide  spinal

In the absence of red flags,  first-line treatment  for chronic  LBP remains conservative therapy  with both 
pharmacologic  and nonpharmacologic  (eg, exercise,  remaining  active)  therapy  [19]. However,  patients  presenting  
with subacute or chronic  LBP, with or without  radiculopathy,  who have  failed  6 weeks of conservative therapy  
should be imaged  if they are believed  to be candidates for surgery  or intervention  or if diagnostic  uncertainty

intervention  or surgery.  MRI of the lumbar  spine  has become  the initial imaging  modali ty of choice in these patients. 
MRI has excellent  soft-tissue contrast  and accurately  depicts lumbar  pathology,  including disc degeneration , as well 
as the thecal  sac and neural  structures [7]. However,  it is well known that many  MRI abnormalities  can be seen in 
asymptomatic individuals  and that imaging  patients  in this category  is often  not beneficial  [7,11,13,21] . MRI  may 
be helpful  when  there is LBP with radiculopathy  or signs  of spinal  stenosis,  which  suggests the presence of 
demonstrable  nerve  root compression  [13].

Page Content: In line with the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations for patients  
ages 65 and older being screened for osteoporosis, patients  >65 years of age may be considered at risk for 
osteoporotic fracture when presenting with LBP . 
Additionally,  for those  patients without  neurologic  compromise  and who present  with minor  risk factors for cancer,  
inflammatory  back  disease  (eg, ankylosing spondylitis), vertebral  compression  fracture,  or symptomatic  spinal  
stenosis,  imaging  should be considered  after a trial of therapy  [4]. 
In the majority  of patients, no specific pathology for LBP can be identified. Also,  studies have  shown  imaging  
abnormalities  in a substantial  number  of people  without back  pain [11-13]. The challenge for the clinician, therefore,  
is to distin guish the small  segment  within  this large patient  population that should be evaluated  further because of 
suspicion  of a more  serious  problem  or identify  pathology that requires intervention . 
Other  nonspine  causes of LBP can have overlap  in clinical  presentation,  including inflammatory  arthritis  and other  
systemic conditions , such as pelvic,  renal,  vascular,  or gastrointestinal  etiologies.  If an inflammatory  etiology  is 
suspected  as the cause of LBP, such as ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic  spondylitis, reactive arthritis, or 
inflammatory  bowel  disease– related  spine  disorders,  please see the ACR  Appropriateness Criteria® topic  on

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
In the United  States,  acute low back  pain (LBP),  with or without radiculopathy , is the leading  cause of years lived  
with disability  and the third  ranking cause of disability -adjusted  life years  [1]. It is the fifth most  common  reason  
for a physician  visit in the United  States  and accounts for approximately  3% of visits  to the emergency  department  
[2]. 
The American  College  of Physicians and the American  Pain Society  classify  LBP into the following  broad  
categories:  nonspecific LBP, back  pain potentially  associated  with radiculopathy or spinal  stenosis,  and back  pain 
potentially  associated  with another  specific spinal  cause [3].",True

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
In patients with chronic wrist pain, imaging studies are  an important adjunct to history, physical examination, 
laboratory testing, and electrophysiology studies. The choice of imaging modality depends on the patient’s 
presentation and the clinical questions being asked. There are scenarios in which no imaging beyond baseline 
radiographs is necessary, but in other situations advanced imaging has added value for diagnostic eva luation and 
treatment planning.  
Overview of Imaging Modalities  
Radiographs  
Imaging evaluation of the painful wrist should begin with radiog raphs [1,2]. This simple study may establish a 
specific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, 
impaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -
anterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or 
more oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling 
[3]. A v ariety of stress positions and maneuvers can be performed to elicit dynamic instability that is not visible 
on standard radiographs [ 4]. Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. 
Additionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ].

Variant 4: Chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or show nonspecific ar thritis. Exclude infection. Next 
study. 
Aspiration  Wrist  
No literature directly addresses the appropriateness of imaging studies beyond radiographs in patients with 
suspected infection in the wrist. However, generalizing from experience with septic arthrit is in other joints, joint 
aspiration should not be delayed in order to obtain advanced imaging studies. In cases of suspected septic arthritis, 
percutaneous aspiration of the wrist is indicated, even when radiographs appear normal. Aspirates should be 
analyzed by cell count, gram stain, and appropriate cultures. Microscopic crystal analysis should also be obtained 
if there is a possibility of gout, acute pseudogout, or hydroxyapatite deposition disease. Aspiration can be 
performed without imaging guidance i f the joint is distended, but either fluoroscopy or US  may be useful if a 
specific compartment is to be targeted.  
MRI Wrist  
There may be a role for MRI with IV contrast enhancement in the staging of infections (for example, to delineate the location and extent of soft-tissue abscesses)  after aspiration has been performed.  Especially in chronic cases, 
MRI with IV contrast may be useful to identify a fluid collection or joint effusion to target  for aspiration.  
However, MRI is usually not appropriate as the next study after radiographs for suspected wrist infections.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
MR arthrography is not routinely used to evaluate suspected wrist infection.

suspected wrist infections.  
CT Arthrography  Wrist

US Wrist  
There may be a role for US in the staging of infections (for example, to delineate the location and e xtent of soft -

Arthrography  Wrist  
Radiographic arthrography  is not routinely used to eval uate suspected wrist infection.  
Variant 5:  Ulnar -sided chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or nonspecific . Next study.  
MRI Wrist  
Both traumatic and degenerative lesions of the TFCC can produce chronic, ulnar -sided wrist pain . MRI is highly 
accurate for lesions involving the radial (central) zone of the disc, especially with the use of high -resolution fast 
spin-echo or 3-D grad ient-recalled pulse sequences [36]. There is some evidence suggesting that MRI performed 
with a 3.0 T system is even more accurate than MRI performed with a 1.5 T system for TFCC lesions [37], but 
there are no studies comparing the accuracy of the two field s trengths in the same patients. The sensitivity for 
tears of the ulnar attachment of the disc and the peripheral attachments (the ulnocarpal ligaments) are only fair 
with noncontrast -enhanced wrist MRI [ 12,36]. IV contrast seldom provides added benefit in patients with ulnar -
sided wrist pain but may increase sensitivity for TFCC lesions if MR arthrography is desired but direct joint 
injection is not feasible.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 10 Chronic Wrist Pain  importantly, though, the finding of enhancing bone marrow “edema” (osteitis) on MRI studies in patients with 
early RA is proving to be the best single predictor of future disease progression and functional dete rioration, even 
compared to serologies and clinical measures [27, 28,32-34].  
US Wrist  
The diagnosis of a specific inflammatory arthritis is typically established based on clinical and laboratory 
analysis. Advanced imaging is usually performed to determine disease activity, guide management decisions, and prognosticate outcomes. In patients with RA, US  of the wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints can  show 
inflammation  as active synovitis. Identifying active synovitis with power Doppler assessment is a useful adjunct 
in making an early diagnosis of RA when a pati ent with early arthritis does not meet the 2010 criteria established 
by the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism [20]. The presence of 
synovitis predicts progression of erosions [31 ] and erosions themselves [35]. US can also depict small bone 
erosions with high spatial resolution; h owever, US is less sensitive to erosions that occur on the radial or ulnar 
sides of the inner carpal bones because direct scanning of these regions is blocked, unlike the dorsal and volar 
bone surfaces. Furthermore, unlike MRI, US cannot show changes within the bone marrow, which are  the 
strongest prognosticator s for disease progression in RA [27, 28,32-34].  In patients with established inflammatory 
arthritis who are undergoing therapy, judging progression or reduction of synovitis may be more difficult with 
sequential US compared to sequential MRI.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
MR arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected inflammatory 
arthritides. 
CT Wrist  
While CT is more sensitive than radiographs for erosions, CT is not routinely used for the diagnosis and 
management of patients with suspected inflammatory arthritides .

better quantified following MRI with IV contrast administration, possibly  if performed dynamically, allowing

Variant  2: Clinically  suspected  osteonecrosis.  Normal  radiographs  or radiographs  that show findings  
suspicious  for osteonecrosis.  Next  imaging  study.  
The body regions covered in this clinical scenario are chest, pelvis, hip, femur, knee, tibia/fibula, ankle, foot, 
shoulder, humerus, elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand.  
Bone  Scan  Area  of Interest  
Because of  poor spatial  resolution,  low specificity,  and the inability  to quantify  the size of the necrotic lesion , bone  
scintigraphy is not beneficial  for characterization  of osteonecrosis.  SPECT may improve  the accuracy  of bone  
scintigraphy [30,32,33]  for detection  of osteonecrosis,  but its use has not been  widely  accepted . In addition,  few 
studies suggest  that bone  scan may be used to screen  for multifocal osteonecrosis [34,35] .

Variant 1: Chronic foot pain. Unknown etiology. Initial imaging.  
Bone Scan Foot  
There is no relevant literature  to support t he use of nuclear medicine studies as the first imaging  study  in the 
evaluation of chronic foot pain.  
CT Foot  
There is no relevant literature to support the use of CT as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot 
pain.  
MRI Foot  
There is no r elevant literature  to support the use of MRI as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot 
pain.  
Radiography Foot  
Conventional radiography can be useful to distinguish among different causes of chronic foot pain and is usually 
the first imag ing study in evaluating patients with chronic foot pain.  
The value of radiographs in the diagnosis of tarsal coalitions has been extensively demonstrated. Overall 
sensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs 
in the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral 
and oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar 
coalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs 
on the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have 
been found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable 
methods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  
Radiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review 
by Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for 
radiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.  
Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain.

MR Arthrography  Knee  
MR arthrography  is not routinely  used as the initial imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the knee.

Radiography Knee  
With no clinical  symptoms  in the injured  knee , including lack of focal  tenderness and joint effusion , and with ability  
to walk,  knee  radiographs  may be indicated  if a patient  >55 years old per Ottawa rules or >50 years old or <12 years 
old per Pittsburgh  rule criteria [5, 6, 10]. If the patient  is between  5 and 12 years,  they fall outside  the age range  for 
both the Ottawa and Pittsburgh  rules and radiographs  may be beneficial  despite lack of clinical  symptoms.  
Radiographs  are commonly  performed  in the setting  of acute knee  injuries  but have  a low yield  for showing  
fractures.  In a retrospective review of 1,967 patients  with acute knee  injuries  by Stiell et al [2], 74.1%  of patients

Radiographic arthrography  is not routinely used to evaluate a palpable mass or ganglion cyst . 
Variant 10: Chronic wrist pain. Suspect occult fracture or stress fracture. Radiographs nondiagnostic. 
Next study.  
MRI Wrist  
Either MRI without I V contrast or CT without IV contrast is usually appropriate in this scenario. MRI is highly 
sensitive to changes in bone marrow composition, and thus is frequently used to identify radiographically occult 
acute fractures throughout the skeleton, including in the wrist (see the ACR Appropriateness Criteria® topic on 
“Acute Hand and Wrist Trauma” [49]). In patients with persistent symptoms thought to be due to an occult wrist 
fracture, MRI can be used as an alternative to presumptive casting and repeat radiographs [ 12]. MRI is also 
sensitive to stress fractures and stress injuries of the physes, for example, in gymnasts [50].  IV contrast does not 
add to the examination and is usually not appropriate.  
CT Wrist  
Either CT without IV contrast or MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate in this scenario. CT can provide high-detail imaging of bone cortex a nd trabeculae and thus can be used to identify radiographically occult  
fractures and stress fractures. Acquisition times are shorter for CT compared to MRI, and CT may be easier to 
perform in patients who are casted. However, MRI’s sensitivity for bone bru ises and soft -tissue injuries is greater 
than CT. In specific circumstances—like suspected fractures of the hook of the hamate— CT may be preferable to 
MRI.  IV contrast does not add to the examination and is usually not appropriate.  
Radiography Wrist  
If not  obtained as part of the initial radiographic series, additional views such as a carpal tunnel or semipronated 
oblique projection  (a “scaphoid view”) may show an otherwise radiographically  occult fracture, and may be 
appropriate .

both the flexor and extensor wrist compartments [46]. Occult ganglion cysts are also easily identified with MRI, 
but some authors recommend use of IV contrast to distinguish ganglia from synovitis [ 47]. For noncystic soft-
tissue masses, MRI may demonstrate findings that are diagnostic for certain benign conditions (eg, lipomas, 
hemangiomas, benign nerve sheath tumors), and can stage the extent of involvement for nonspecific masses ( see 
the ACR Appropriateness Criteria® topic on “ Soft-Tissue Masses ” [48]). 
US Wrist  
Wrist US or MRI (without or without  and with IV contrast) are alternative initial examinations that are usually 
appropriate in this setting. US  is useful for examining extra -articular soft tissue s, such as suspected ganglion cysts 
[17],  with an accuracy similar to that  of MRI.  
CT Wrist  
There is no support in the literature for CT in the initial diagnosis of a palpable mass or suspected ganglion cyst 
with normal or nonspecific radiologic findings. CT may have a role in cases in which calcification or ossification 
is demo nstrated radiologically, or in the staging of a lesion that is first evaluated by MRI or US , but CT with or

clinical response to a steroid injection in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome [70 ]. MR neurography

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 15 Low Back  Pain MRI lumbar  spine  without  IV contrast  is useful  in determining  the acuity  of a vertebral  fracture,  as evidenced  by 
bone  marrow  edema and in demonstrating spinal  canal  compromise,  for example from  displaced  or retropulsed  
fractures.  For imaging  evaluation  and management  of vertebral  compression  fractures,  please see the ACR 
Appropriateness Criteria® topic on “ Management of Vertebral  Compression  Fractures ” for guidance [57]. 
Additionally,  the distinction  between  malignant  and benign  compression  fractures  can be assessed  on MRI.  The 
visualization  of the convex posterior  vertebral  body  border,  extension into the posterior  elements,  and abnormal  
marrow  signal  are suggestive  of pathologic  fracture  [58]. 
CT myelography of the lumbar  spine  assess the patency  of the spinal  canal/thecal  sac and of the subarticular  recesses  
and neural  foramen  [22]. It can be useful  in patients  with osteoporotic  fracture  with neurologic  deficit . This modality  
has the disadvantage  of lumbar  puncture  and injection  of intrathecal  contrast  [22]. 
Bone  scan with SPECT/CT is usually  not used for initial imaging  but can be useful  for radiographically occult  
fractures and can be used to evaluate acuity  of vertebral  fracture . [59]. 
Whole -body FDG-PET/CT is typically  not an initial imaging study,  but as a follow -up study , it can help distinguish  
between  benign and pathologic  compression  fractures  when  other  imaging modalities  are indeterminate  [60].

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 13 Low Back  Pain MRI Lumbar Spine Without and With IV Contrast  
Although MRI  lumbar  spine  without  IV contrast  is the preferred  initial study,  MRI lumbar  spine  without  and with 
IV contrast  may be helpful  to delineate  etiology  of CES when  clinical  suspicion  of underlying malignancy,  
infection, or inflammation  (see Variant  7). 
MRI Lumbar Spine Without IV Contrast  
MRI lumbar  spine  without  IV contrast  is most  useful  in the evaluation  of suspected  CES, multifocal deficit, or 
progressive  neurologic  deficit  because of its ability  to accurately  depict  soft-tissue pathology,  assess vertebral  
marrow,  and assess the spinal  canal  patency.  A prospective  cohort  study by Bell et al [41] recommends urgent  MRI  
assessment  in all patients  who present  with new-onset  urinary  symptoms  in the context  of LBP or sciatica.  Recently, 
a single  3-D heavily  T2-weighted  fat-saturated  sequence protocol  has been  shown  to be a rapid,  highly sensitive 
tool for evaluating  CES in the emergency  department  that can be utilized  for improved efficiency  and emergency  
department  throughput  [42]. 
Radiography Lumbar  Spine  
There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of radiography in the initial imaging  of suspected  CES. 
Variant  5: Low  back  pain  with  history  of prior  lumbar  surgery  and with  or without  radiculopathy. New or 
progressing  symptoms  or clinical findings . Initial imaging.  
There are many  causes of back  pain following  surgery.  Some  of the more  frequent  etiologies  diagnosed  with 
imaging  include  free disc or bone  fragments,  postoperative  scarring,  failure  of bone  graft  for fusion,  and recurrent  
disc protrusion.

MRI Shoulder  Without  IV Contrast  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of MRI shoulder  without  IV contrast  in the initial evaluation  of 
chronic  shoulder  pain.  
Radiography Shoulder  
Most  literature  suggests that radiographs  should be the initial imaging  study  in patients  with shoulder  pain [1,10] . 
Standard  radiographic  exam ination  consists of a combination  of different  projections  typically  including  
anteroposterior  (AP) internal  rotation,  AP external  rotation,  Grashey  (oblique  AP in the plane  of the glenohumeral  
joint), scapular  “Y,” and axillary  views [10]. Radiographs  can evaluate for unexpected  fracture,  unsuspected  
aggressive bony lesion,  osteoarthritis, inflammatory  arthropathy,  osteonecrosis,  or calcium  hydroxyapatite  
deposition.  Accurate  interpretation  of radiographs  can often  obviate  additional  imaging  or be complementary  to 
subsequent  imaging studie s. A high-riding  humeral  head  on radiographs  is highly associated  with chronic  rotator  
cuff tear [11], particularly  if seen in combination with sclerosis of the inferior acromion,  greater  tuberosity  cysts,  a 
lateral  acromial  spur, and cortical  irregularity  or sclerosis of the greater  tuberosity  [12-14]. 
US Shoulder  
The literature  suggests that radiographic  evaluation  should  generally  be the first imaging  study  ordered  in patients  
with shoulder  pain [1,10-14] .

There is no role for bone scintigraphy in assessment of Bankart or Hill -Sachs lesions.  
Variant 6: Traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs normal.  Physical examination and history consistent 
with dislocation event  or instability . Next imaging study. 
Shoulder dislocation or instability is most co mmon in the anterior direction. Younger patients are more likely to 
have labroligamentous injury and persistent instability after dislocation compared with older patients [54]. Older 
patients are more likely to have rotator cuff tears in association with shoulder dislocation [ 55]. Coexisting 
humeral avulsion of the glenohumeral ligament and significant glenoid bone loss have been found in up to 10% of 
patients with recurrent shoulder instability [ 56], which underscores the need to assess both osseous and 
labroligamentous pathology in patients with shoulder dislocation or instability. Glenoid morphology and bone 
loss can play a significant factor in recurrent shoulder dislocations [15, 16,57], which may require bone grafting in 
order to restore stability [ 57].

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 11 Shoulder Pain –Traumatic  Variant 5: Traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs show Bankart  or Hill-Sachs lesion. Next imaging  study. 
Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions are common findings associated with transient shoulder dislocation. Bankart 
lesions have a particularly high association with transient shoulder dislocations [50], and a transient shoulder 
dislocation should be presumed if a Bankart lesion is present. A close association exists bet ween Bankart and 
Hill-Sachs lesions [ 51], and one should be sought out whenever the other is identified on radiographs. Both 
Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions can present as nonosseous  lesions that are occult on r adiographs and noncontrast 
CT. 
MRI Shoulder  
Similar to MR arthrography, noncontrast MRI is comparable to CT in evaluating glenoid and humeral head bone 
loss [12,18]. In general, noncontrast MRI performs well in diagnosing labroligamentous injuries [ 20,52]. 
However, noncontrast MRI is considered inferior to MR arthrography for assessing labroligamentous pathology 
frequently associated with Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions [ 17,19]. Noncontrast MRI is a good alternative to MR 
arthrography in the setting of acute injury when significant glenohumeral joint effusion is present to assist in 
visualization of intra -articular soft -tissue pathology.  
MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography is the preferred study for evaluating subacute or chronic Bankart lesions because of  its soft -
tissue contrast. Multiple studies have shown MR arthrography to be reliable in diagnosing labroligamentous 
injuries [12,17,52] and superior to noncontrast MRI for this indication [ 17,19].",False

study. 
Appropriately positioned  radiographs can exclude shoulder dislocation and most displaced fractures as the 
etiology for post -traumatic shoulder pain. In the setting of normal shoulder radiographs, the most common causes 
of post -traumatic shoulder pain are soft -tissue injuries such  as rotator cuff and labral tears.  
MRI Shoulder  
Noncontrast MRI is a reasonable imaging study in the setting of acute nonlocalized traumatic shoulder pain and 
noncontributory radiographs. In the acute trauma setting, noncontrast MRI may be preferred to MR arthrography , 
as acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint effusion for assessment of intra -articular 
soft-tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic 
pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [34,35]. MRI is also sensitive for diagnosing bone marrow 
contusion and has  been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries in pediatric patients [ 36,37]. 
MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography has been found to be superior to noncontrast MRI in the diagnosis of labroligamentous and 
partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [17,19]. In the acute trauma setting, however, noncontrast MRI may be 
preferred to MR arthrography because acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint 
effusion for assessment of intra-arti cular soft -tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing 
extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [ 34,35]. MRI is also sensitive

proven labral lesions as the study population instead of evaluating all patients with clinically unstable shoulders. 
Compared to noncontrast  MRI, MR arthrography  has been shown to have increased sensitivity for detection of 
anterior labral and SLAP tears [19]. In addition, MR arthrography has been shown to detect unsuspected labral 
pathology in patients referred for imaging with low or no clinical suspicion of labral pathology [66]. 
MRI Shoulder  
MRI without contrast may be preferred to MR arthrography in the setting of acute shoulder dislocation w hen a 
post-traumatic joint effusion is typically present to provide sufficient visualization of soft -tissue structures. In the 
subacute or chronic setting, the glenohumeral joint effusion is usually too small to provide adequate joint 
distention to adequat ely assess soft-tissue structures. Non contrast MRI has been shown to be inferior to MR 
arthrography in diagnosing labroligamentous and rotator cuff injuries [ 17,19]. 
CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
CT arthrography provides comparable sensitivity and possibly improved specificity in detection of labral lesions 
compared to MR arthrography  [12,67] and can provide improved visualization of the bones in cases of complex 
trauma. However, interobserver variability in reporting of labral lesions is low [13]. CT arthrography has also 
been shown to be inferior to MR arthrography in assessing partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [12], which makes 
CT arthrography less desirable in patients where rotator cuff tears may be suspected. However, CT arthrography 
may be considered in a patient with shoulder dislocation/instabili ty and contraindication to MRI.  
CT Shoulder  
Noncontrast CT is unable to assess rotator cuff and labroligamentous pathology.

Shoulder dislocation or instability is most co mmon in the anterior direction. Younger patients are more likely to 
have labroligamentous injury and persistent instability after dislocation compared with older patients [54]. Older 
patients are more likely to have rotator cuff tears in association with shoulder dislocation [ 55]. Coexisting 
humeral avulsion of the glenohumeral ligament and significant glenoid bone loss have been found in up to 10% of 
patients with recurrent shoulder instability [ 56], which underscores the need to assess both osseous and 
labroligamentous pathology in patients with shoulder dislocation or instability. Glenoid morphology and bone 
loss can play a significant factor in recurrent shoulder dislocations [15, 16,57], which may require bone grafting in 
order to restore stability [ 57].

MR arthrography is the preferred exam ination  for the evaluation of subacute shoulder dislocations or recurrent 
shoulder instability. MRI has been shown to have similar performance to CT in the evaluation of Hill-Sachs 
lesions and glenoid bone loss [12,18]. MR arthrography has also been found to be reliable in diagnosi ng anterior 
shoulder instability and labroligamentous injuries [58,59]. MR arthrography has specifically o utperformed 
noncontrast MRI in assessment of glenohumeral ligament and anterior labral injuries [ 17,19], which ar e 
commonly seen in shoulder instability. MR arthrogr aphy has also outperformed noncontrast MRI in diagnosis of 
rotator cuff tears [17,19], which is a common associated finding in older patients with shoulder dislocation. 
However, high sensitivities reported for MR arthrography in the detection of labral pathology may not be 
applicable to patients with clinically unstable shoulders. A retrospective review of 90 patients with clinically 
unstable shoulders selected for arthroscopy [ 60] found that MR arthrography had a sensitivity of 65% for 
detection of labral  tears. The authors proposed that this discrepancy with prior studies was the result of different 
patient selection criteria (clinically unstable in their study versus less-specific symptoms such as shoulder pain in 
others) and the interpretation of MR art hrography by experienced musculoskeletal radiologists [ 60]. For this 
document, it is assumed the procedure is performed and interpreted by an expert.

clinical response to a steroid injection in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome [70 ]. MR neurography 
may be an option in patients with suspected carpal tunnel syndrome.  The use o f IV contrast does not contribute to

• When radiographs are normal or equivocal and a patient has persistent symptoms wi th an unclear diagnosis, 
MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate.  
• In patients with suspected inflammatory arthritis, MRI either with or without IV contrast is usually 
appropriate if guidance for management or prognostication is needed.  
• Patients with  suspected wrist infection should undergo aspiration.  
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal in a patient with ulnar -sided pain, either MRI without IV contrast 
or an MR arthrogram of the wrist is usually appropriate.  
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal in a patient with radial -sided pain, MRI without IV contrast is

The value of radiographs in the diagnosis of tarsal coalitions has been extensively demonstrated. Overall 
sensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs 
in the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral 
and oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar 
coalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs 
on the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have 
been found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable 
methods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  
Radiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review 
by Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for 
radiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.  
Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain.

Page Content: • Variant 3 : MRI without IV contrast or MRI without and with IV contrast is usually appropriat e as additional 
imaging following radiographs  of the foot , in diabetic patients with or without neuropathic arthropathy when 
foot swelling and ulceration is present and osteomyelitis is suspected.  These procedures are equivalent 
alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage 
the patient’s care) . The panel did not agree on recommending a Tc -99m 3-phase bone scan foot  in this clinical 
scenario . There is insufficient medical literature to conclude  whether or not a Tc-99m 3- phase bone scan 
would be of benefit . A Tc -99m 3-phase bone scan in this patient population is controversial but may be 
appropriate.
