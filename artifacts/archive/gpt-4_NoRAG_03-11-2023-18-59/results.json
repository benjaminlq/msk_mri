An MRI lumbar spine with IV contrast is a detailed imaging study that can help identify abnormalities such as a prolapsed intervertebral disc or muscle strain. However, given the patient's symptoms and the absence of red flag symptoms such as fever, weight loss, history of cancer, or severe, progressive neurological deficits, a more conservative approach may be appropriate initially. This could include pain management, physical therapy, and observation. If symptoms persist or worsen, imaging may then be indicated. \n\n3. Based on the scoring criteria, the scan order for an MRI lumbar spine with IV contrast is USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE at this stage. The patient's symptoms are likely due to a musculoskeletal strain related to his recent cricket match, and there are no red flag symptoms present that would indicate a more serious condition requiring immediate imaging. A more appropriate initial approach would be conservative management with pain relief and physical therapy.
