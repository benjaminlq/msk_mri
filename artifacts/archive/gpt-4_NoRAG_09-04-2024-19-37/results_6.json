It can help identify any structural abnormalities, such as disc herniation, spinal stenosis, or spondylolisthesis, which could be causing the patient's symptoms. Given the patient's age and the presence of a step deformity, these conditions are plausible and an MRI would be a good choice to visualize them. \n\n3.
