2. Explanation: The patient is a young, active individual who has sustained a traumatic injury to the shoulder with positive physical examination findings suggestive of instability. The X-ray did not show any fractures or dislocations. According to the ACR guidelines for traumatic shoulder pain, noncontrast MRI is a reasonable imaging study in the setting of acute nonlocalized traumatic shoulder pain and noncontributory radiographs. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing extra-articular soft-tissue traumatic pathology such as capsular and ligament tears. Therefore, the ordered MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate in this case.

Page Content: Although evaluation  of glenoid bony integrity  is typically  better  with CT imaging,  some  practitioners have  used 
ultrashort  or zero echo  time sequences [96-98], 3-D sequences  [99], or conventional  MRI  sequences  [100]  to 
measure glenoid bone  loss with a high concordance  to CT images.  
Radiography Shoulder  Additional Views  
There are several  options  for additional  radiographic  views in patients  with suspected  instability  [1]. The West  Point  
and Garth  views can demonstrate the anterior  inferior glenoid at a better  advantage  in patients  with a suspected  
Bankart  fracture.  A Stryker  notch  view can sometimes demonstrate  a Hill-Sachs lesion  that is difficult  to see on 
conventional  projections.  Although these additional  projections  are used by some  practitioners , they do not usually  
alleviate  the need  for advanced  imaging.  
US Shoulder  
The posterior  labrum  can be reliably  visualized  with US, with posterior  labral  tears potentially  visualized  
particularly  if the joint is distended  [101] . However,  US is of limited  benefit  in assessing  the anterior  
labroligamentous  complex,  superior  labrum,  articular  surface,  and subchondral  bone.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 8 Shoulder Pain –Traumatic  Variant 2: Traumatic shoulder pain. Nonlocalized shoulder pain. Negative radiographs . Next imaging 
study. 
Appropriately positioned  radiographs can exclude shoulder dislocation and most displaced fractures as the 
etiology for post -traumatic shoulder pain. In the setting of normal shoulder radiographs, the most common causes 
of post -traumatic shoulder pain are soft -tissue injuries such  as rotator cuff and labral tears.  
MRI Shoulder  
Noncontrast MRI is a reasonable imaging study in the setting of acute nonlocalized traumatic shoulder pain and 
noncontributory radiographs. In the acute trauma setting, noncontrast MRI may be preferred to MR arthrography , 
as acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint effusion for assessment of intra -articular 
soft-tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic 
pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [34,35]. MRI is also sensitive for diagnosing bone marrow 
contusion and has  been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries in pediatric patients [ 36,37]. 
MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography has been found to be superior to noncontrast MRI in the diagnosis of labroligamentous and 
partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [17,19]. In the acute trauma setting, however, noncontrast MRI may be 
preferred to MR arthrography because acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint 
effusion for assessment of intra-arti cular soft -tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing 
extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [ 34,35]. MRI is also sensitive 
for diagnosing bone marrow contusion and has been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries 
in pediatric patients [ 36,37].

There is no role for bone scintigraphy in assessment of Bankart or Hill -Sachs lesions.  
Variant 6: Traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs normal.  Physical examination and history consistent 
with dislocation event  or instability . Next imaging study. 
Shoulder dislocation or instability is most co mmon in the anterior direction. Younger patients are more likely to 
have labroligamentous injury and persistent instability after dislocation compared with older patients [54]. Older 
patients are more likely to have rotator cuff tears in association with shoulder dislocation [ 55]. Coexisting 
humeral avulsion of the glenohumeral ligament and significant glenoid bone loss have been found in up to 10% of 
patients with recurrent shoulder instability [ 56], which underscores the need to assess both osseous and 
labroligamentous pathology in patients with shoulder dislocation or instability. Glenoid morphology and bone 
loss can play a significant factor in recurrent shoulder dislocations [15, 16,57], which may require bone grafting in 
order to restore stability [ 57].

Guideline: ACR shoulder pain traumatic.pdf, Page: 6
Page Content: Most soft -tissue injuries (such as labral tears and rotator cuff tears) can undergo a period of 
conservative management prior to considering surgery. However, in addition to the specific imaging findings 
related to a traumatic injury, indications and timing of surgical treatment of many traumatic shoulder injuries are 
dependent on patient age, comorbidities, current activity level, and expected activity level.  
Imaging of chronic shoulder pain is beyond the scope of this topic  and is cove red in the  ACR Appropriateness 
Criteria® on “Shoulder Pain– Atraumatic ” [3]. 
Discussion o f Procedures  by Variant  
Variant 1:  Traumatic shoulder pain. Any etiology . Initial imaging . 
Radiography Shoulder  
Radiographs are the preferred initial study performed in the setting of traumatic shoulder pain . They can delineate 
shoulder malalignment and most shoulder fractures [ 4,5]. A standard set of shoulder radiographs for trauma 
should include at least three  views: anterior -posterior (AP) views in internal and external rotation and an axillary 
or scapula-Y view. Axillary or scapula-Y views are vital in evaluating traumatic shoulder injuries as 
acromioclavicular and glenohumeral dislocations can be misclassified on AP  views [6,7]. Radiographs provide 
good delineation of bony anatomy to assess for fracture and appropriate shoulder alignment, which are the two 
primary concerns in management of acute traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs should also be performed upright 
since malalignment of the shoul der can be under -represented on supine radiographs [ 4]. Additional views, such as 
the Bernageau view, have been sho wn to be effective in demonstrating the degree of bone loss of the glenoid or 
humeral head [ 8]. 
CT Shoulder  
Computed tomography ( CT) is better able than radiogr aphs to characteriz e fracture patterns [ 9-11].

Guideline: ACR shoulder pain traumatic.pdf, Page: 14
Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 14 Shoulder Pain –Traumatic  CT Shoulder  
Noncontrast CT is unable to assess rotator cuff pathology in the acute setting.  
US Shoulder  
In the post -traumatic setting, US  has been shown to detect abnormalities, including rotator cuff tears [ 25]. In 
general, US can have high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of full -thickness rotator cuff tears [ 70-72] . 
There is conflicting evidence on the ability of US  to diagnose partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [17,22,24,44,72]. 
Similarly, although interobserver agreement in detection of full -thickness rotator cuff tears can be high, it is much 
more variable for detection of partial -thickness tears [73,74]. 
FDG -PET/CT  Skull Base to Mid-Thigh 
FDG-PET/CT is not routinely used  for describing  rotator cuff tears.  Indirect identification of symptomatic rotator 
cuff tears has been described on FDG-PET/CT  by decreased radiotracer activity in the muscles of the torn tendons 
and increased activity of surrounding shoulder girdle muscles due to muscle recruitment  [28,29]. However, FDG-
PET/CT  cannot describe the extent of rotator cuff tear or degree of rotator cuff atrophy, which are relevant for 
clinical management.  
Bone Scan  Shoulder  
Bone scintigraphy is not routinely used  for describing rotator cuff tears . Increased radiotracer activity has been 
associated with symptomatic rotator cuff tears [33]. However, bone scintigraphy cannot describe the extent of 
rotator cuff tear or degree of rotator cuff atrophy, which are re levant for clinical management.

According to the context, there is no standard method of following patients with MRI to evaluate for treatment response or disease progression. However, the American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism agree that the decision to repeat MRI to assess disease activity or monitor for disease response depends on the clinical circumstances. Specifically, MRI of the sacroiliac joints may be helpful for cases in which the disease activity is unclear, available clinical or laboratory data are conflicting, or knowledge of MRI findings is expected to alter treatment. In this case, the patient is asymptomatic and the scan is being used to monitor disease activity/response, which is considered appropriate.

There is no role for contrast -enhanced  CT in the evaluation  of axSpA.  
Fluoride  PET/CT Skull Base to Mid-Thigh 
There is not enough data to support  the routine  use of PET/CT in the evaluation  of patients  with suspected  axSpA.  
F-18-fluoride  has been  shown  to be a potentially  useful  tracer  in identifying  sites of osteoblastic activity  in axSpA  
patients  [64,65] . Uptake on PET/CT has also been  shown  to correlate with clinical  disease activity  in patients with 
axSpA  [66,67] ; however,  there is conflicting  evidence regarding the extent  to which  tracer  uptake  correlates with 
specific inflammatory  and structural  lesions seen on CT and MRI resulting  in uncertain ty about  its diagnostic  utility  
[64,67- 72]. In one study,  the interreader  reliability  of diagnosing  sacroiliitis  on PET/CT was poor and substantially  
lower  than that for MRI or CT [67]. In a small  study using  radiographs  as the reference standard,  F-18-fluoride  
PET/CT had a sensitivity  of 80% and specificity  of 77% for the detection  of sacroiliitis  in AS, although  there are 
inherent  limitations  in the use of radiographs  as the reference standard  for diagnosing  axSpA  [73]. Given  the 
available data,  the utility  of PET/CT in the diagnosis  of axSpA , including its utility  in assessment  of the spine,  is 
uncertain  at this time.

Guideline: ACR inflammatory back pain.pdf, Page: 11
Page Content: MRI Spine  Area  of Interest  
Although MRI  of the sacroiliac joints  has high utility  for the diagnosis  of axSpA,  some  patients  will not demonstrate  
imaging  features of axSpA  in the sacroiliac joints  on MRI as indicated  by sensitivities  of all studies to varying 
degrees below  100%  [22], and therefore  some  patients may need  further imaging  evaluation  with MRI given that it 
is the imaging  modality  of choice for the diagnosis  of axSpA  [1,3,19,22] . Studies  have  shown  widely varying  
degrees of isolated  spinal  involvement  on MRI in axSpA  ranging from  1% to 49% [19,59-63,114,115] . Therefore,  
imag ing of the spine  is beneficial  for patients  in whom  there is suspicion  for axSpA  but imaging  of the sacroiliac 
joints  has been  negative.  Some  authors  have  shown  the utility  of using  whole -spine  or whole -body  MRI to identify  
the burden of disease rather  than selecting  specific areas of the spine  to image  because findings  may be potentially  
isolated  to any portion of the spine  [10,59,63,89,114,120-122] . 
The spine  MRI  findings  of axSpA  include  the active inflammatory  changes of spondylitis  and spondylodiscitis,  the 
inflammatory  changes of the costovertebral  joints,  costotransverse joints,  and facet  joints  and areas of enthesitis  
along other  vertebral  ligamentous  attachments [123] . The chronic  structural  changes of fatty deposition,  erosions,  
and syndesmophytes  are also characteristic findings  [123] .

which  MRI findings  correlate with disease activity  is variable [30]. The American  College  of Rheumatology and

Radiography Sacroiliac  Joints   
There is no standard  method of following  patients  with radiographs  to evaluate for progression of structural  changes  
[22], and the American  College  of Rheumatology recommends against  routine  radiographic  follow -up given  the 
lack of proven benefit  [30]. Repeat  radiographs  can be obtained as necessary  for counseling  patients  on the status  
and prognosis  of their disease,  although radiographs  are more  typically  performed  to evaluate the spine  rather  than 
the sacroiliac  joints  [30]. This is because of  the low utility  of sacroiliac joint radiographs  for detecting  disease  
progression based  on the relatively  poor intra- and interreader  reliability  of interpretation  [141] . Radiographs  can 
demonstrate evolving  structural  changes or bone  formation,  although these changes occur  slowly  over time at the 
sacroiliac joints, often  requiring  years to detect  a change and prompting many  authors  to suggest  a radiographic  
imaging  interval  of axSpA  patients  of no less than 2 years for assessment  of disease progression [141- 146]. There 
is evidence that patients  on TNF -inhibitors  may have  slower  progression of structural  damage at the sacroiliac joints

While there is no recent literature that directly addresses the role of first-line examinations for chronic wrist pain, 
radiographs are usually  appropriate as an initial study. Radiographs are widely available , and for many bone, 
joint, and alignment abnormalities, radiographs alone are diagnostic. In other patients, nonspecific radiologic findings (including those in the soft  tissues) combined with the history and physical examination may be

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 6 Acute Hand and Wrist Trauma  Like CT, MRI shows intra -articular extension of distal radius fractures more frequently than radiography.  Unlike 
CT, MRI shows concomitant ligament  injuries, including tears of the scapholunate ligament, which may affect 
surgical treatment [26,27]. Despite these advantages,  MRI performed immediately at the time of injury has little 
added value for determining which patients go on to surgery [ 23]. 
MRI is especially useful in evaluating  hand soft -tissues injuries, including the collateral ligaments, volar plates, 
tendons, and pulleys. For metacarpal and digital fractures, MRI is usually not indicated during acute injury [ 22]. 
There is no evidence to support the use of MRI with IV contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist trauma.  
US Area of Interest  
US may have a limited utility  for evaluating bone injuries. Christiansen et al  [28] reported 47% sensitivity and 
61% specificity of US  for the detection of scaphoid fractures . They concluded that US  is not suitable for the early 
diagnosis of scaphoid fracture.  In contrast, Hauger et al  [29] reported that using cortical disruption as a diagnostic 
criterion on US is an accurate sign for detecting occult fractures of the scaphoid waist. Further study of US  for the 
diagnosis of occult fractures is needed .

Assessment of carpal instability with conventional radiographs requires careful attention to radiographic 
positioning.  In low -grade injuries, radiographs are usually normal.  Scapholunate diastasis of >4 mm and dorsal til t 
of the lunate of > 10° suggests dorsal intercalated segmental instability  [30,31].

Page Content: Variant 2: Suspect acute hand or wrist trauma. Initial radiographs nega tive or equivocal. Next imaging

Radiograph y Area of Interest  
In patients with clinical suspicion of hand or wrist fracture and negative radiographs, one option is to place the 
patient in a short arm cast and repeat the radiographs at 10  to 14 days [ 13]. The downside of this option is that it 
results in delay of diagnosis , which may lead to functional impairment . 
CT Area of Interest  
When the initial radiographs are equivocal, CT  without IV contrast  is commonly used to exclude or confirm 
suspected wrist fractures [18]. CT shows intra-articular extension of distal radius fractures more frequently than 
radiography.  Three-dimensional reconstructions can be particularly helpful in preoperative planning for complex 
articular injuries  [7,8]. 
CT should be used to exclude an occult fracture of the upper extremity. Unlike MRI, CT cannot evaluate for 
concomitant ligamentous injuries  [19-21 ]. 
CT is useful in diagnosing injuries that are difficult to recognize on radiographs, such as carpometacarpal joint 
fracture dislocations. For metacarpal and digital  fractures, CT is usually not indicated during acute injury [ 22]. 
There is no evidence to support the use of CT with IV contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist trauma.  
MRI Area o f Interest  
When initial radiographs are normal but there is high clinical suspicion for fracture, MRI without IV contrast can 
detect fractures of the distal radius and carpal bones [12,23-25] . One study of patients in which the radiographic 
findings did not explain the clinical symptoms reported that the MRI led to a change in diagnosis in 55% of 
patients and a change in patient management in 66%  [12]. However, another study of patients with acutely injured 
wrists reported that the MRI did not predict the need for treatment better than the combination of physical 
examination and radiography [ 23]. More importantly, there was no difference in outcomes  with MRI compared 
with radiography [24].",False

sensitivity for A3 and A5 pulleys  [70]. 
Bone Scan Hand 
Bone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  
Variant 7: Suspect penetrating trauma with a foreign body in the soft  tissues in the hand or wrist. Initial 
radiographs are negative.  Next imaging study.  
CT Area of Interest  
CT has high sensitivity for detection of radiopaque foreign bodies [77, 78]. In case of penetration of foreign body 
into deep tissues or bone, CT is recommended [ 79]. 
There are no studies of the hand and wrist. For comparabl e studies regarding  foreign bodies in the feet, CT has 
63% sensitivity and 98% specificity.  CT detection rates depend on the attenuation values of the foreign bodies.  
CT is superior to MRI in identifying water -rich fresh wood [ 80]. 
MRI Area of Interest  
MRI has lower sensitivity compared to CT for detection of foreign bodies [ 78,79]. 
For foreign bodies in the feet, MRI has 58% sensitivity and 100% spe cificity. MRI detection rates depend on the 
associated susceptibility artifact [ 80]. There are no comparable studies of the hand and wrist.  
MRI may be useful in certain circumstances,  such as with complicated foreign bodies.  MRI helps identify foreign 
bodies by the presence of air or metal susceptib ility artifact or adjacent edema or fibrosis.  MRI may also be used 
to exclude associated osteomyelitis (see the ACR Appropriateness Criteria® topic on “ Suspected Osteomyelitis, 
Septic Arthritis, or Soft Tissue Infection (Excluding Spine and Diabetic Foot) ” [81]) or abscess [77]. 
In cases of s uspected traumatic nerve injury of the hand and wrist, MRI with dedicated neu rography sequences 
(eg, diffusion  weighted) ha s shown improved visualization of the injured nerves  [82].

Summary of R ecommendations 
• Variant 1: Radiographs area of interest is usually appropriate for the initial imaging of adults with acute 
blunt or penetrating trauma to the hand or wrist.  
• Variant 2: Repeat radiographs in 10– 14 days, MRI without IV contrast, or CT without  IV contrast is usually

trauma and when radiographs show acute wrist fracture. These procedures are equivalent alternativ es. 
• Variant 4: CT of both wrists without IV contrast, MRI of wrist without IV contrast, or MR arthrography of 
wrist is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for adults when initial radiographs shows distal 
radioulnar joint or carpal malalignment in  the absence of fracture. These procedures are equivalent 
alternatives.  
• Variant 5: MRI of hand without IV contrast or US of hand is usually appropriate as the next imaging study 
for adults with suspect hand tendon or ligament trauma and when radiographs show acute hand fracture.

Radiographs  
While there is no recent literature that directly addresses the role of first-line examinations for chronic wrist pain, 
radiographs are usually  appropriate as an initial study. Radiographs are widely available , and for many bone, 
joint, and alignment abnormalities, radiographs alone are diagnostic. In other patients, nonspecific radiologic findings (including those in the soft  tissues) combined with the history and physical examination may be 
sufficient for clinical diagnosis, or may suggest preferred secondary imaging studies.

The MRI scan is ideal for evaluating tendon injuries and helping with surgical planning, as stated in the context. It can be used to assess capsule and collateral ligament injuries of the metacarpophalangeal joints, which is relevant in this case. Therefore, the MRI scan is usually appropriate to assess ligamentous/tendon injury.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 5 Acute Hand and Wrist Trauma  Most fractures of the thumb are visible on a 2-view radiographic examination, although there is a slight increase 
in dia gnostic yield with the addition of an oblique projection [ 13], which can be obtained along with a PA 
examination of the whole hand.  
In patients with suspected finger tendon injuries, radiographs are used to detect fracture fragments, as large 
fragments may require open reduction and internal fixation.  Radiographs are usually sufficient for  the evaluation 
of osseous “mallet” injuries, which include bony avulsion at the insertion of the extensor mechanism of the finger 
to the distal interphalangeal joint [16]. In these injuries, involvement of more than one -third of the articular 
surface usually requires operative fixation.  Palmar displacement of the distal phalanx or an interfragmentary gap 
of >3 mm is also an indication for surgery [ 16]. With extensor tendon injuries, radiographs are commonly used to 
assess for bone involve ment and determine need for operative fixation [ 17]. 
CT Area of Interest  
In patients with intra -articular fractures seen on radiography , CT shows articular fracture fragment displacement, 
depression, and comminution more accurately than conventional radiographs [ 7,9,10]. CT measurements of 
articular surface gap and step -off are more reproducible than radiographs [7]. The addition of 3- D surface -
rendered reconstructions to the standard 2 -D CT images has been shown to change operative management in up to 
48% of intra -articular distal radius fractures [8]. 
There is no evidence to support the use of CT with intravenous  (IV) contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist 
trauma.

MRI is ideal for evaluating tendon injuries and helping with surgical planning [58, 59]. MRI is comm only used for 
the diagnosis of  Stener lesions of the thumb [60] and the diagnosis of pulley system injuries [61]. 
Hergan et al [62] reported a 100% sensitivity and specificity for assessment of thumb ulnar collateral ligament 
tears. Spaeth et al [ 63] reported a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 94% for detection of displaced ulnar 
collateral ligament tears in 16 cadaveric specimens.  
US Hand  
A Stener lesion occurs when the aponeurosis of the adductor pollicis muscle becomes interposed between the 
ruptured ulnar collateral ligament of the thumb and its site  of insertion at the base of the proximal phalanx. This 
lesion can be identified by absence of ulnar collateral ligament and the presence of a hypoechoic mass proximal to 
the apex of the metacarpal tubercle [64]. Dynamic examination shows the relationship of the aponeurosis to the 
retracted ligament stump [65] . 
US allows for diagnosis of pulley system injuries [ 66,67].

capsule and collateral ligament injuries of the proximal interphalangeal  and metacarpophalangeal joints [68]. 
For flexor tendon injuries, Rubin et al [ 69] reported a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of  100% in cadavers.

Page Content: If associated soft -tissue injury is clinically suspected, CT, CT arthrography, MR I, MR arthrography, 
or ultrasound (US) may be indicated  [7-10]. 
Successful treatment of distal radius fractures requires restoration of radial length, inclination, and tilt, as well as 
the realignment of the articular fracture fragments [9,11]. The presence of a coronally  oriented fracture line, die -
punch depression, or more than three articular fracture fragments are common indications for operative reduction 
[8]. Operative fixation resulting in < 2 mm of residual articular surface step-off is usually considered necessary to 
avoid long-term complications , such as osteoarthritis [9 ,12]. 
Discussion of Procedures by Variant  
Variant 1: Acute blunt or penetrating trauma to the hand or wrist. Initial imaging.  
Radiograph y Area of Interest  
Radiography is  always indicated as the initial imaging for suspected acute hand and wrist trauma.  For m ost joints 
of the extremities, especially those involving the wrist, hand, and fingers, a radiographic examination that 
includes only 2 views is not adequate for detecting fractures [13]. For patients with suspected  distal radius 
fractures, a 3-view examination  of the wrist  usually includes a posteroanterior (PA) , a lateral, and a 45° 
semi pronated oblique view  [11]. One study [ 14] reports that a fourth projection—a semisupinated oblique —
increases diagnostic yield for distal radius fractures.  
A standard 3 -view radiographic examination of the hand shows most fractures and dislocations of the metacarpals 
and phalanges [ 13]. For phalangeal injuries, some centers include a PA examination of the entire hand, whereas 
others limit the examination to the injured finger.",True

1. Classification: USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE
2. Explanation: According to the ACR guidelines, the initial imaging for acute hip pain with a history of fall or minor trauma and suspected fracture should be radiographs of the hip or pelvis. MRI is usually appropriate as the next imaging study if the initial radiographs are negative and a fracture is still suspected. In this case, the patient has not had any initial imaging performed yet, so jumping straight to an MRI is not the usual protocol.
3. Recommendation: Radiographs of the hip or pelvis should be performed as the initial imaging study.",USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE,Radiographs of the hip or pelvis,"Guideline: ACR acute hip pain suspected fracture.pdf, Page: 2
Page Content: Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of hip fractures is critical. Hip fractures 
cannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded on the basis of physical exam ination  alone ; therefore , imaging plays a 
key role in early  and accurate diagnosis [14] . 
The biomechanics of proximal femoral and pelvic fractures that are a result of major trauma differs as these 
injuries may be seen in any age group, often with additional accompanying high-velocity injuri es of the abdomen 
and pelvis . Motor vehicle –related trauma is the most common  mechanism. Thorough evaluation of the hip may be 
superseded  in these instances by the need for resuscitation and diagnosis and treatment of more urgent associated 
vascular or solid organ injuries. Imaging plays an important role not only in the diagnosis of high-velocity 
fractures but also in characterizing fracture mechanism and morphology for treatment planning purposes.  
However, imaging of high-velocity hip fractures occurs in the context of a broader trauma evaluation. A full 
discussion of the broader imaging workup of blunt trauma is beyond the scope of this paper and will be covered in 
the upcoming ACR Appropriateness Criteria® titled “Major Blunt Trauma” and will be made available on the 
ACR website  when completed . 
Treatment  for both intra - and extracapsular proximal femoral fractures in the elderly is typically surgical fixation  
because of the risk of further fracture displacement and the dangers of prolonged immobilization in the elderly 
[15]. Joint replacement may be  performed for displaced fractures of the femoral neck where the risk of femoral 
head avascular necrosis is high. Fractures from high -force trauma are also commonly treated with surgical 
fixation for stability to reduce the risk of post -traumatic osteo arthritis.

Page Content: CT can also be helpful  
in identifying  extra-articular  impingement  (ischiopelvic,  ischiotrochanteric,  subspinous,  and femoropelvic)  [45,46] . 
Measurements can be performed  on radiography,  CT, and MRI [42-44,47,48] . Sometimes  limited  images  of the 
knees may be obtained  as part of the hip CT to evaluate for femoral  version;  occasionally  knee  pathology may be 
identified  on these images  as a possible  cause of the patient’s  hip pain [49]. 
Fluoride  PET/CT Skull Base to Mid-Thigh 
One study demonstrated  the potential use of fluoride  PET to demonstrate increased  bone  turnover  in the setting  of 
chronic  hip pain and FAI [50]. One other  study  demonstrated  that fluoride  PET can demonstrate acetabular  
contrecoup injuries  in patients  with FAI [51]. However,  increased  radiotracer  uptake  is a nonspecific  finding,  and, 
overall,  there is insufficient  literature  to support  the use of fluoride  PET/CT skull base to mid-thigh in the evaluation  
of chronic  hip pain thought  to be due to hip impingement  and/or  dysplasia.  
Image -Guided Anesthetic +/- Corticosteroid  Injection  Hip Joint  or Surrounding  Structures  
Fluoroscopic -, CT-, or US-guided anesthetic and/or  corticosteroid  injections  can be a useful  tool for clarifying  the 
source of a patient’s  chronic  hip pain.  In addition  to intra-articular  injections, selective trochanteric  and iliopsoas  
bursal/peritendinous  injections  can be performed  for both diagnostic  or therapeutic purposes  using anesthetic and/or  
corticosteroid  injectate,  respectively.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 6 Acute Hip Pain -Suspected Fracture  Bone Scan H ips 
Prior to the advent of MRI, a bone scan was the preferred test for radiographically occult proximal femoral 
fractures. However, as early as 1993 , Rizzo et al [50] demonstrated MRI to be at least as accurate as bone scan s 
and with substantially decreased time to diagnosis. A later study by  Rubin et al [51] comparing bone scan s and 
MRI demonstrated i mproved sensitivity and specificity of MRI relative to bone scans . Moreover, t he bone scan 
group averaged an additional day to surgery.  
Bone scintigraphy is a time-consuming process. Bone scans may be falsely negative for up to 72 hours from the 
time of in jury, and false-positive scans are likewise common, related to osteoarthritis, soft -tissue injury , or any 
other process that may increase bone turnover [50] . It has been postulated that performing single -photon emission 
computed tomography may combine the sensitivity of bone scintig raphy with the spatial accuracy of CT , but there 
are no data to support this view. In current practice, the role of bone scan s as a secondary line of imaging in 
patients with contraindications to MRI has largely been usurped by CT.  
Summary of Recommendations 
• Variant 1:  Radiographs  of the hip, radiographs  of the pelvis, or radiographs  of the pelvis and hips is usually 
appropriate for the initial imaging of the hip with acute pain, fall or minor trauma, and suspected fracture.  
• Variant 2:  MRI pelv is and affected hip without IV contrast  or CT pelvis and hips without IV contrast is 
usually appropriate as the next imaging study for the evaluation of a cute hip pain from a fall or minor trauma  
with negative radiographs  and suspected fracture.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Fractures of the proximal femur (commonly referred to as hip fractures)  are a frequent  source of morbidity and 
mortality in elderly osteoporotic patients [1]. Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type 
result in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men 
[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs 
will continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of 
life following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays 
in diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -
and long-term mortality [6-13]. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of hip fractures is critical.",True

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  hip pain is a common chief  complaint  for patients , reportedly affecting  30% to 40% of adults  who play 
sports  [1,2] , and 12% to 15% of all adults  over 60 [3,4] . A wide variety  of pathological  entities  may cause hip pain, 
including  osseous  as well as intra- or extra -articular  soft tissue abnormalities  [5-7]. Pathology  involving  the lumbar  
spine,  sacroiliac,  or knee  joints  can also cause hip pain [8], and these  etiologies  should  be investigated  as needed . 
There is limited  original  research  that specifically  targets the imaging  of chronic  hip pain,  but imaging  of specific  
conditions  is widely  discussed  in the published  literature. 
Before  imaging,  an appropriate  assessment  of a patient’s  clinical  history  and physical  examination  is essential  in 
trying  to pare down the range  of possible etiologies  for a patient’s  symptoms.

For further evaluation  of disorders  such as dysplasia or FAI, specialized  views such as the false  profile  or elongated  
femoral  neck  lateral  (Dunn)  views  can provide  more  detailed  evaluation  of the anatomy  of the femoral  head  and 
neck  and the degree of acetabular  coverage of the femoral  head  [47]. 
US Hip 
In general,  US is limited  in its use for evaluating  osseous structures.  However,  there is limited  literature  that 
demonstrates that US can be used to evaluate osseous features of FAI such as the alpha -angle  [73]. However,  US is 
not able to adequately  evaluate osseous abnormalities  deep  to the cortex.  One of the advantages  of US is its ability  
to dynamically  evaluate for extra-articular  soft tissue  impingement.  US is not as sensitive as MRI or CT 
arthrography  for the detection  of labral  tears  [17], but it can be useful  for the detection  and localization  of paralabral  
cysts for aspiration  and injection  [39,41] . 
Variant  4: Chronic  hip pain. Suspect  labral tear.  Radiographs  negative  or nondiagnostic. Next  imaging

fractures. However, as early as 1993 , Rizzo et al [50] demonstrated MRI to be at least as accurate as bone scan s 
and with substantially decreased time to diagnosis. A later study by  Rubin et al [51] comparing bone scan s and 
MRI demonstrated i mproved sensitivity and specificity of MRI relative to bone scans . Moreover, t he bone scan 
group averaged an additional day to surgery.  
Bone scintigraphy is a time-consuming process. Bone scans may be falsely negative for up to 72 hours from the 
time of in jury, and false-positive scans are likewise common, related to osteoarthritis, soft -tissue injury , or any 
other process that may increase bone turnover [50] . It has been postulated that performing single -photon emission 
computed tomography may combine the sensitivity of bone scintig raphy with the spatial accuracy of CT , but there 
are no data to support this view. In current practice, the role of bone scan s as a secondary line of imaging in 
patients with contraindications to MRI has largely been usurped by CT.  
Summary of Recommendations 
• Variant 1:  Radiographs  of the hip, radiographs  of the pelvis, or radiographs  of the pelvis and hips is usually 
appropriate for the initial imaging of the hip with acute pain, fall or minor trauma, and suspected fracture.  
• Variant 2:  MRI pelv is and affected hip without IV contrast  or CT pelvis and hips without IV contrast is 
usually appropriate as the next imaging study for the evaluation of a cute hip pain from a fall or minor trauma  
with negative radiographs  and suspected fracture.

2. Explanation: According to the ACR Appropriateness Criteria for Acute Trauma to the Ankle, MRI without IV contrast is usually not appropriate for initial imaging in patients with acute trauma to the ankle who are able to walk and have no point tenderness over the malleoli, talus, or calcaneus on physical examination. This patient was able to continue jogging immediately after the incident and is able to walk normally. There is no point tenderness at the right ankle or midfoot. Therefore, the Ottawa Ankle Rules are negative and an MRI is not usually the appropriate initial imaging study.

Possible tendon abnormalities include tenosynovitis, tendinopathy, tendon tear (partial or complete), and tendon 
subluxation or dislocation.  Both MRI and US can effectively demonstrate ankle tendon abnormalities, although 
US results are more dependent on operator skill and expertise [ 10,35]. For the assessment , it is assumed the 
procedure is performed and interpreted by an expert.

Variant 5: Chronic ankle pain. Ankle radiographs normal or nonspecific, suspected ankle instability. Next study . 
In the absence of findings on routine radiography, imaging options to evaluate ligamentous integrity include stress radiography, MRI, MR arthrography, CT arthrography, and US.  
MRI  
One study eva luating anterior talofibular ligament injury demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy of 97% for MRI 
when compared to arthroscopic findings. Additionally, MRI identified the exact location of the injury in 93% of 
the cases [15].  Comparing MRI with arthroscopy, studies have shown a range of accuracies of chronic lateral 
ligament tearing (either partial or complete), ranging from 77 % to 92% for the anterior talofibular ligament and 
88% to 92% for the calcaneofibular ligament [14, 52]. For the evaluation of deep deltoid ligament tears, MRI is 
both sensitive and specific compared with arthroscopy, with reported values of 96% and 98%, respectively [53].  
With regard to tears of the tibiofibular ligaments of the tibiofibular syndesmosis, MRI has a reported accuracy of 100% [54]. Additionally, MRI can also demonstrate interosseous membrane tears [55]. MRI offers the advantage 
of evaluating for injuries associated with or mimicking lateral instability that may not be diagnosed on stress radiography such as tenosynovitis, tendon injury, and osteochondral lesions [56]. MRI may also be used to evaluate the ankle after lateral ligament reconstruction [57].  
MR Arthrography  
MR arthrography can be helpful for the assessment of chronic ankle instability due to lateral collateral ligament injuries [12].  
US 
One study evaluating anterior talofibular ligamen t injury demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy of 91% for US when 
compared to arthroscopic findings.

Maisonneuve fracture (syndesmotic injury of the ankle in combination with a proximal fibular fracture) may be 
overlooked as a result of  lack of pain at the fibula. Careful palpation of the proximal fibula should be performed 
with radiographic evaluation of the entire tibia and fibular if focal tenderness is present [74] . 
US Ankle  
US is not typically the next line of evaluation  of syndesmotic injuries. Although some studies have suggested 
focused US could be beneficial for ligamentous evaluation, others have shown limited utility in lateral ankle

2. Explanation: The patient is a 17-year-old male with acute trauma to the ankle from a soccer injury. He was unable to walk immediately after the injury and has point tenderness at the tip of the lateral malleolus. X-rays did not show any fracture or dislocation. The patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest a possible ligamentous injury. According to the ACR guidelines, MRI is the reference standard for ligamentous injury and assessment of stability, which is particularly important in athletes. Therefore, an MRI of the right ankle without IV contrast is usually appropriate in this clinical scenario to assess for ligamentous injury.

Lateral sprain is more common than medial strain , with the anterior talofibular ligament most commonly tor n. High 
sprain and fractures are more common in high -collision sport injuries [60], with higher incidence of ankle injuries 
during winter months [67] and increased incidence in military recruits [68]. Inversion injuries of the ankle account 
for 25% of musculoskeletal system injuries and 50% of all sports -related injuries [1].  
Bone Scan Ankle  
Bone scan is not routinely the next line of imaging in this clinical scenario.  
CT Ankle  
CT is useful for evaluation of dislocation and can be used to detect  syndesmotic injuries, although MRI is better for 
soft-tissue evaluation. Nault et al [69]  validated CT scan measurement s that  can identify syndesmotic injuries seen 
on MRI (retrosp ective study of MRI and CT) as a result of  modification of distal tibiofibular relationship after a 
mild syndesmotic injury.

rates of osteonecrosis, osteoarthritis, and infection  [71]. 
MRI Ankle  
MRI is the reference standard for ligamentous injury and assessment of stability , which is particularly important in 
athletes, in whom determination of grade (1, 2,  or 3) of syndesmotic ligament, anterior tibiofibular ligament , and 
deltoid injuries is critica l for treatment planning and return to sport assessment [51] . 
Ligamentous injuries can occur without fracture on radiography. Grossterlinden et al  [52] compared MRI and 
radiography and showed that 15% of ligamentous injuries (including sprains, partial tears, and complete tears) at 
the syndesmosis in acute ankle injuries on M RI demonstra ted no fracture on radiography.  
Rare pantalar dislocations without associated talar or other fracture can be assessed on CT or MRI and have high 
rates of osteonecrosis, osteoarthritis, and infection  [71]. 
Radiography Ankle Stress Views  
Stress radiograph s may be useful in assessing syndesmotic instability, particularly in supination external rotation 
ankle injuries according to the Lauge -Hansen classification. Lee et al [72]  noted that tibiotalar tilt angle and anterior 
tibiofibular space measurements were affected when the anterior tibiofibular and posterior talofibular ligaments 
were injured (confirmed on MRI) in 299 patients . Lateral stress testing with widening of the tibiofibular clear space 
has been shown to be  an indicator of syndesmotic injury , with the traditional external rotation stress test shown to 
be a poor indicator when t he deltoid ligament is injured [73] .",True

MRI is the most  sensitive modality  for the detection  of occult  fracture  and acute bone  stress changes [34,35] . MRI  
is not routinely  used as the first imaging study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the foot in setting  of suspected  
MTP joint injury  or occult  fracture.  Both  MRI and US are used in evaluating  soft-tissue injuries  of the foot in the 
setting  of acute trauma,  especially  when  radiographs  are noncontributory.  Both  modalities  have  a similar  
sensitivity  for acute soft-tissue  trauma  about  the ankle  and foot such as ligamentous  and tendinous  disruption [36-
38]. 
US Foot  
US is not routinely  used as the first imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the foot in the setting  of 
suspected  MTP joint injury  or occult  fracture.  US has been  shown  to be sensitive for the diagnosis  of acute tendon  
rupture  or tendon dislocation  in the foot [36,39,40] . 
Fluoroscopy  Foot

are negative,  MRI can be obtained in select  patients  with forefoot  pain because of its increased  sensitivity  for the 
early  detection  of metatarsal  head  subchondral  fracture  [54]. 
Lisfranc  Injury  
MRI has been  advocated  as a sensitive diagnostic  test in evaluation  of Lisfranc ligamentous  complex  (especially  
if the patient  is not able to bear weight),  and 3-D volumetric  acquisitions  have  proven superiority  over orthogonal  
proton  density  fat-suppressed  imaging [33,38,41- 45]. There is a high correlation  between  MRI and intraoperative  
findings  for an unstable  Lisfranc injury  [44]. In the patient  with a suspected  Lisfranc injury  and normal  
radiographs,  the literature  supports  further advanced  imaging  by MRI  and CT [21,33,43,46] . 
Turf Toe and Plantar  Plate Injuries 
MRI is the preferred  imaging method for evaluating  suspected  “turf  toe” and lesser  metatarsal  plantar  plate  injury  
by directly  evaluating  the soft-tissue structures of the capsuloligamentous  complex  as well as assessing  chondral  
and osteochondral  lesions [29,55,56] . 
Acute  Tendinous  Rupture  
MRI tends  to be used as a screening  tool when  one is not certain  of the specific tendon injury  or if concomitant  
osseous injury  is suspected.  Both  MRI and US have  been  shown  to be sensitive  for the diagnosis  of acute tendon  
rupture  or dislocation  in the foot [39].

Radiograph y Foot  
Radiographs  are indicated  by positive  Ottawa rules with 99% sensitivity  in determining  the presence of a foot 
fracture  [1,9,10] . Radiographs  are the mainstay  of initial imaging in the setting  of acute foot trauma.  Initial  
imaging typically  consists of a 3-view study  with the possibility  of additional  views as indicated  by the clinical  
setting  [8]. Additional  views,  such as axial  calcaneal  view,  can be useful  in patients  with suspected  calcaneal  
fracture  [15] because addition of this view  increases specificity  in diagnosing calcaneal  fractures  and sensitivity  in 
distinguishing intra-articular  calcaneal  fractures.  
Lisfranc  Injury  
When  there is a fairly  high clinical  suspicion  of an acute Lisfranc injury,  the foot should be imaged.  In addition  to 
a typical  3-view  radiographic  study  of the foot (anteroposterior  [AP],  oblique,  and lateral),  an AP view with 20° 
craniocaudal  angulation can be added  [16,17] . Although patients  with Lisfra nc sprains may incur  ligamentous  
damage  without  diastasis [18], radiography  should be the initial imaging modality  in the setting  of a suspected  
Lisfranc injury.

CT Foot  
Lisfranc  Injury  
CT has been  advocated  as the primary  imaging  technique  in acute hyperflexion  injury  and high-energy  
polytrauma  (especially  if the patient is not able to bear weight)  [33,38,41- 45]. CT is useful  in demonstrating the 
multiple  metatarsal  and cuneiform  fractures that can be associated  with a ligamentous  Lisfranc  injury  [21,22,33] . 
CT is typically  used for preoperative  planning  for fracture  treatment  and evaluation.  In the patient  with a 
suspected  Lisfranc  injury  and normal  radiographs,  the literature  supports  further  advanced  imaging  by MRI  and 
CT [21,33,43,46] . 
Acute  Tendinous  Injury  
CT imaging has been  shown  to be an effective way of documenting various  tendon entrapment  and dislocations,  
in particularly  peroneal  dislocations  and peroneal  retinacular  injuries , which  are associated  with comminuted  
calcaneal  fractures  [47-50].

associated  with prolonged recovery  times  in elite athletes [51]. MRI can demonstrate  ligamentous  and osseous

Guideline: ACR acute trauma to foot.pdf, Page: 4
Page Content: Radiography Foot  with  Weightbearing  
If there are clinical  signs  of a Lisfranc  injury , obtaining  weight bearing  radiographs  is recommended  when  
possible  because nonweightbearing  radiographs  are not reliable  for detection  of subtle  injuries.  Weightbearing  
views have  been  shown  to increase the abnormal  alignment  at the Lisfranc joint, thus making it easier  to identify  a 
Lisfranc injury  [16,19] . The inclusion  of both feet on AP radiographs  can help in the detection  of subtle  
malalignment  when  compared  with the uninjured side [20]. 
CT Foot  
CT is commonly used in evaluating  the true extent  of osseous injury  in complex fractures and at times  is used as 
the initial imaging  study  in polytrauma  patients  and in complex  regions  such as the midfoot  [21,22] . CT is not

2. Explanation: Given the patient's history of acute trauma to the knee with severe swelling and pain, an MRI of the knee without IV contrast is usually appropriate. This is in line with the ACR Appropriateness Criteria for Acute Trauma to the Knee, which states that MRI has many distinct advantages for the evaluation of the injured knee in the setting of negative radiographs. It allows for the detection of soft-tissue injuries, which are more common in acute knee injuries, and aids in treatment decision-making by providing a more accurate diagnosis. In this case, no radiographs have been performed yet, but given the severity of the patient's symptoms, an MRI is a reasonable initial imaging study.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 9 Acute  Trauma  to the Knee  in the setting  of the acute noncontact  ACL  injury, both the presence and the severity  of lateral  bone  contusions  were  
associated  with high-grade  pivot -shift, concomitant  lateral  meniscal  lesions as well as anterolateral  ligament  
abnormality . Klengel  et al [29] found that the apparent  diffusion coefficient  maps  are more  sensitive  than 
corresponding proton density -weighted  fat-saturated  turbo spin-echo  MRI sequences for detection  of bone  marrow  
lesions after knee  trauma  and allowed  detection  of significantly  more  and larger  bone  marrow  lesions.  Additionally,  
apparent  diffusion coefficient  map evaluation  improved diagnostic  performance in regions  with insufficient  spectral  
fat saturation,  such as the patella.  Koster  et al [30] showed  that the presence of a bone  contusion  on MRI after acute  
knee  trauma  is highly  predictive  of the development  of focal  osteoarthritis  1 year after trauma . 
MRI facilitates diagnosis  of the anterolateral  ligament injuries  that have  frequent  association  with ACL  injuries  and 
anterolateral  knee  instability , of which  a minority  are associated  with Segond fractures  [31]. In a study by Kosy  et 
al [32], MRI detected  a larger  number  of anterolateral  ligament  injuries  in association  with the ACL  injuries  within  
6 weeks of the acute knee  trauma  compared  with scans performed  later, which  suggests that some  injuries  may 
resolve or become less visible  with increased  chronicity . MRI  is proven helpful  in detection  and characterization  of 
posterolateral  corner  injuries , which  can be associated  with the ACL  ruptures  and, if missed , may lead to 
considerable morbidity.

Bone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the 
subchondral bone.  New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or 
patients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee 
pain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the 
origin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. 
Subchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed 
spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to 
elderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs 
often initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, 
and progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is 
suspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria
® 
topic on “ Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae ” [28]. 
Some patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using 
quantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs 
exhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ].

Page Content: Patellofemoral car tilage loss is also associated with chronic knee pain , with active knee pain correlated with 
BMLs [30,31]. Similar to CT, MRI can calculate various anatomic measurements associated with patellofemoral 
subluxation/dislocation and lateral patellofemoral friction syndrome [32-34]. Bone marrow edema in the classic 
location for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also 
differentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise 
therapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. 
Other etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat 
pad impingement syndromes, Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome, adhesive 
capsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes , 
and osteonecrosis [15, 19,36-45].  
MRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a 
joint effusion. However, contrast -enhanced images ma y be more accurate in diagnosing other causes of chronic 
knee pain , such as Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome, and adhesive 
capsulitis [15].  In particular, enh ancing synovitis thicker than 2 mm in Hoffa’s fat is correlated with peripatellar 
pain [46]. Contrast -enhanced MRI is also useful in quantifying the degree of synovitis and in evaluating 
conditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis [ 17,42,47,48].

Page Content: In this study , multidetector  CT showed a low sensitivity  for other  soft-
tissue injuries  at the knee;  however,  its high specificity  indicated  that apparent  posterior  cruciate  ligament , meniscal,  
and collateral  ligament  tears can reliably  be treated  as true-positive  findings  [15]. 
The dual-energy  CT virtual  noncalcium  technique  can subtract  calcium  from  cancellous bone,  allowing  detection  
[16-18] and possibly grading of the post-traumatic  bone  marrow  contusions  [18]. 
However,  MRI is superior  to CT in detection  of bone  marrow  abnormalities  and meniscal  and ligamentous  injuries  
and may be subsequently  performed  as clinically  indicated.

The majority  of patients  (93.5%)  who present  with acute  knee  injuries  in the emergency  department  sustained  soft-
tissue injuries  rather  than osseous injuries  [19].  MRI  is a proven valuable  tool in the treatment  decision -making  
process,  allowing  earlier  surgical  intervention  by obtaining  a more  accurate diagnosis  [20,21] . Frobell et al [22] 
reported  a low diagnostic  benefit  of the initial clinical  examination  in the setting  of acute knee  trauma  with higher -

Special Imaging  Considerations  
Knee radiographs  should include at least one frontal projection of one or both knees (anteroposterior, Rosenberg, 
or tunnel), a tangential patellar view , and a lateral view of the affected knee [2,9]. Standing radiographs more 
accurately reflect medial and lateral compartment cartilage loss than supine radiographs with the posteromedial and posterolateral joint compartments  more accurately assessed using a weight -bearing flexion posteroanterior 
radiograph [9,10].

Summary of Literature Review  
Background/Introduction 
Chronic knee pain affects tens of millions of people  in the United States annually , with the pain sometimes highly 
disabling and often negatively impacting the patient’s quality of life. Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and 
it can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain 
with the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. 
Typically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain 
persists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  
imaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated 
that approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the 
prior year) radiographs [2 ].

1. Classification: USUALLY APPROPRIATE
2. Explanation: The patient is a 15-year-old male who experienced an acute twisting trauma to the knee while playing soccer, with symptoms including knee swelling, effusion, and mild medial joint line tenderness. The X-rays showed no fracture or dislocation, but the clinical examination suggests possible ligamentous and meniscal injury. According to the context, MRI is a highly specific and sensitive method for detecting meniscal and ligamentous injuries, and it can potentially decrease delayed diagnosis, improve patient outcomes, and decrease disability. Therefore, the ordered MRI left knee without IV contrast is usually appropriate for this patient.

A retrospective study  by Cecava et al [25] showed  that knee  radiography  is a highly specific screening  test for 
internal  derangement  in patients  <40 years old with acute knee injury.  In this patient population,  knee  effusion  >10 
mm on lateral  radiograph  should prompt  consideration  for the knee  MRI examination , which  can potentially  
decrease delayed  diagnosis,  improve  patient  outcomes,  and decrease  disability  [25].  
Magee et al [26] reported  96% sensitivity  and 97% specificity  of 3T MRI in the detection  of meniscal  tears in

Conventional radiography can be useful to distinguish among different causes of chronic foot pain and is usually 
the first imag ing study in evaluating patients with chronic foot pain.  
The value of radiographs in the diagnosis of tarsal coalitions has been extensively demonstrated. Overall 
sensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs 
in the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral 
and oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar 
coalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs 
on the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have 
been found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable 
methods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  
Radiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review 
by Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for 
radiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Ankle pain is considered chronic when symptoms persist > 6 weeks. Chronic ankle  pain can be caused by a variety 
of osseous or soft -tissue abnormalities, either alone or in combination. For assessing chronic ankle pain, there are 
multiple imaging options, including radiography, stress radiography,  computed tomography (CT)  radionuclide 
bone scanning, ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and various injection procedures. Injection 
proce dures include arthrography, CT arthrography, MR arthrography, and diagnostic injection with anesthetic 
agents. Although there are numerous causes for chronic ankle pain, common etiologies include osteoarthritis, 
osteochondral injury, tendon abnormalities, ligament abnormalities and instability, and impingement.  
Overview of Imaging Modalities  
Radiography Radiographs can provide information about the osseous and soft -tissue structures about the ankle. Routine 
radiographs of the ankle typically include anteroposterior, lateral, and mortise views, the latter obtained by internally rotating the foot 15 to 20 degrees.

Stress views are not routinely used for the evaluation of suspected tendon abnormality.  
Variant 5: Chronic ankle pain. Ankle radiographs normal or nonspecific, suspected ankle instability. Next study . 
In the absence of findings on routine radiography, imaging options to evaluate ligamentous integrity include stress radiography, MRI, MR arthrography, CT arthrography, and US.  
MRI  
One study eva luating anterior talofibular ligament injury demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy of 97% for MRI 
when compared to arthroscopic findings. Additionally, MRI identified the exact location of the injury in 93% of 
the cases [15].  Comparing MRI with arthroscopy, studies have shown a range of accuracies of chronic lateral 
ligament tearing (either partial or complete), ranging from 77 % to 92% for the anterior talofibular ligament and 
88% to 92% for the calcaneofibular ligament [14, 52]. For the evaluation of deep deltoid ligament tears, MRI is 
both sensitive and specific compared with arthroscopy, with reported values of 96% and 98%, respectively [53].  
With regard to tears of the tibiofibular ligaments of the tibiofibular syndesmosis, MRI has a reported accuracy of 100% [54]. Additionally, MRI can also demonstrate interosseous membrane tears [55]. MRI offers the advantage 
of evaluating for injuries associated with or mimicking lateral instability that may not be diagnosed on stress radiography such as tenosynovitis, tendon injury, and osteochondral lesions [56]. MRI may also be used to evaluate the ankle after lateral ligament reconstruction [57].  
MR Arthrography  
MR arthrography can be helpful for the assessment of chronic ankle instability due to lateral collateral ligament injuries [12].

According to the ACR guidelines for chronic ankle pain, MRI is not routinely used as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain. However, in the case where ankle radiographs are normal or nonspecific, and there is a suspected osteochondral abnormality, MRI can be used as the next study. MRI can identify osteochondral abnormalities with high sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, the ordered MRI scan is usually appropriate in this clinical scenario.

Summary  of Recommendations 
• Variant 1 : Radiography elbow  is usually appropriate for the initial imaging of  chronic elbow pain.  
• Variant 2 : In the setting of chronic elbow pain with mechanical symptoms such as locking, clicking, or limited 
range of motion with normal or nonspecific radiographs, MR arthrography elbow or MRI elbow without IV 
contrast or CT arthrography elbow or CT elbow without IV contrast  is usually appropriate as the next imaging 
study for suspect intra-articular pathology such as osteocartilaginous body, osteochondral lesion, or synovial 
abnormality. These procedures are equivalent altern atives (ie, only one procedure will be ordered to provide 
the clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).

will be ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care). Although the panel 
did not agree on recommending 3-phase bone scan elbow, because there is insufficient medical literature to 
conclude whether these patients would benefit from the procedure, its use may be appropri ate. 
• Variant 4 : In the setting of chronic elbow pain with normal or nonspecific radiographs,  US elbow or MRI 
elbow without IV contrast is usually appropriate  as the next imaging study for suspected chronic epicondylalgia

MRI Elbow  
MRI elbow  may detect  loose  bodies,  and this is enhanced  in the presence of joint fluid.  Thus,  T2-weighted  images  
are recommended for the evaluation  of loose  bodies  in the elbow  [17]. MRI may also show  the presence of enlarged  
plica,  which  can result  in symptoms  of locking  and/or  pain with extension  [15]. MRI is often  suggested  as the initial  
study to assess for osteochondral  lesion  [12,17] . MRI  is less sensitive  than radiographs  in the detection  of 
heterotopic  ossification/calcification  [18]. Similar  to MR arthrography,  MRI elbow  is limited  in the evaluation  of 
cartilage defects [16]. 
US Elbow  
Although US may demonstrate  early -stage osteochondral  lesions and medial  epicondylar  fragmentation  [10], the 
details  of an osteochondral  lesion  are better  defined  by CT arthrography or MR arthrography.  Because of 
shadowing,  evaluation  of heterotopic  ossification  and loose  bodies  is limited  on US.

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  elbow  pain is a common  patient  complaint  in the primary  care setting. Patients  may report  symptoms  of 
swelling,  pain,  restricted  range  of motion,  stiffness,  and numbness  or tingling  [1]. There is a wide  differential  
diagnosis  for chronic  elbow  pain, including osseous,  soft tissue,  cartil aginous , and nerve -related  abnormalities.  
Epicondylalgia , caused  by tendinosis  of the common  extensor  tendon laterally  (“tennis elbow”)  or medially  the 
common  flexor  tendon  (“golfer’s  elbow ”), is the most  common  cause of chronic  elbow  pain,  estimated  to occur in 
1% to 3% of the population  [2]. Epicondylalgia  is associated  with lost workdays  and a significant  economic  burden  
[3].

1. Classification: USUALLY APPROPRIATE
2. Explanation: Given the patient's profile, the ordered MRI scan is usually appropriate. The patient is a professional tennis player experiencing worsening right elbow pain, particularly during tennis, and a weakening grip on the racquet. These symptoms, along with the tenderness at the lateral epicondyle, suggest a possible case of lateral epicondylitis, commonly known as ""tennis elbow"". The MRI scan is a suitable imaging procedure for this condition. According to the context information, MRI has high inter- and intraobserver reliability for the diagnosis of epicondylalgia, with a sensitivity of 90% to 100% and a specificity of 83% to 100%. It can also demonstrate associated findings in epicondylalgia, including radial collateral and lateral UCL injuries, which may be relevant in this case. Furthermore, MRI can facilitate surgical planning if necessary.

heterotopic  ossification/calcification  [18]. Similar  to MR arthrography,  MRI elbow  is limited  in the evaluation  of 
cartilage defects [16]. 
US Elbow  
Although US may demonstrate  early -stage osteochondral  lesions and medial  epicondylar  fragmentation  [10], the 
details  of an osteochondral  lesion  are better  defined  by CT arthrography or MR arthrography.  Because of 
shadowing,  evaluation  of heterotopic  ossification  and loose  bodies  is limited  on US.

MRI has high inter- and intraobserver  reliability  for the diagnosi s of epicondylalgia  [26]. It also has a sensitivity  of 
90% to 100%  and a specificity  of 83% to 100%  [27]. The most  specific findings  of medial  epicondylalgia  include  
interm ediate to high T2 signal  or high T2 signal  within  the common  flexor  tendon  and paratendinous  soft tissue  
edema [28]. MRI has the benefit  of demonstrating associated  findings  in epicondylalgia , including radial  collateral  
and lateral  UCL  injuries  [26]. MRI may also facilitate  surgical  planning [29]. 
MRI is useful  for the diagnosis  of biceps  tendon injury.  Sensitivity  and specificity  are reported  at 92.4%  and 100%,  
respectively,  in detecting  distal  biceps tendon  ruptures  and 59.1%  and 100%,  respectively  for partial  tears [30].

2. Explanation: The patient presents with symptoms and physical examination findings suggestive of ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow (cubital tunnel syndrome). The MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate in this case to evaluate for ulnar nerve entrapment, as it can evaluate the nerve and surrounding structures. This is supported by the context information which states that MRI can be used to evaluate entrapment syndromes. 
3. Recommendation: NO CHANGE REQUIRED",USUALLY APPROPRIATE,MRI without IV contrast,"Guideline: ACR chronic hand and wrist pain.pdf, Page: 8
Page Content: These factors make CT the 
preferred examination for suspected distal radioulnar joint subluxation, where images of both wrists can be  
obtained in both supination and pronation [1 ,13]. A disadvantage of CT  is its lower sensitivity to soft -tissue 
abnormalities  compared with MRI.  
High-resolution (typically multidetector) CT of the wrist following contrast injection into one or more wrist 
compartments (CT arthrography) is a powerful tool for diagnosing intra -articular abnormalities [14,15]. The 
intraobserver agreement on CT arthrogram images is extremely high and better than that reported for MRI 
[14,16]. 
US 
US of the wrist is useful for examining extra -articular soft tissues, such as suspected ganglion cyst s [17], because 
its accuracy is similar to that of MRI. US can also be used to diagnose abnormalities of the flexor and extensor 
tendons and tendon sheaths. For de Quervain disease (stenosing tenosynovitis of the abductor pollicis lon gus and 
extensor pollicis brevis tendon compartment), preoperative identification of a septum or subcompartmentalization 
within the first dorsal compartment with US  may affect surgical management [18 ,19]. 
In patients with suspected or established rheumatoid arthritis (RA), US examination of the wrist and selected 
finger joints can identify erosions and active synovit is (with the use of power Doppler), findings that influence 
early diagnosis and treatment decisions [20]. Using US to measure the size of the median nerve is a  validated  
technique in patients with clinical symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome [21-24].  
In addition, w rist US is a useful technique to guide therapeutic intr a-articular and other soft -tissue injections [25].  
Discussion of Procedures by Variant  
Variant 1: Chronic wrist pain. With or without prior injury. Best initial study.

Guideline: ACR chronic hand and wrist pain.pdf, Page: 16
Page Content: • Patients with  suspected wrist infection should undergo aspiration.  
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal in a patient with ulnar -sided pain, either MRI without IV contrast 
or an MR arthrogram of the wrist is usually appropriate.  
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal in a patient with radial -sided pain, MRI without IV contrast is 
usually appropriate.

Page Content: The MRI findings that have been reported in wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome —
including nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing—may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value 
in patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68]. In rare cases of secondary carpal tunnel syndrome, MRI may identify 
a mass lesion compressing the median nerve. There is some evidence that the length of T2 hyperintensity in the 
median nerve can help prognosticate the success of surgery [69] and that the shape and signal of the nerve predict 
clinical response to a steroid injection in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome [70 ]. MR neurography 
may be an option in patients with suspected carpal tunnel syndrome.  The use o f IV contrast does not contribute to 
diagnosis and is usually not appropriate.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
MR arthrography is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.  
CT Wrist  
CT, with or without IV  contrast, is not routinely used to diagnose carpa l tunnel syndrome.

Summary of Recommendations  
• Wrist radiographs are indicated as the best initial imaging examination in patients with chronic wrist pain. 
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal and a patient has persistent symptoms wi th an unclear diagnosis, 
MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate.  
• In patients with suspected inflammatory arthritis, MRI either with or without IV contrast is usually 
appropriate if guidance for management or prognostication is needed.  
• Patients with  suspected wrist infection should undergo aspiration.

Once a scaphoid fracture is identified, Radiographic arthrography does not contribute to the evaluation for 
complications of the fracture.  
Variant 12: Chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or nonspecific. Suspect carpal tunnel syndrome.  Next 
study. 
US Wrist 
Several meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the 
carpal  tunnel  inlet) is highly accurate for identifying carpal  tunnel syndrome  diagnosed clinically or with the 
combination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US 
varies depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the 
measurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary 
examination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel 
syndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal 
tunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, 
clinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of 
carpal tunnel syndrome. US may be appropriate in cases where this initial evaluation is equivocal.  
MRI Wrist  
Historically, carpal tunnel syndrome has been diagnosed based on clinical signs and sympt oms and confirmed by 
the results of electrodiagnostic studies [67]. MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in cases in which this  
initial evaluation is equivocal.

Page Content: Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  
usually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, 
osteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite 
versus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess 
with radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton’s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other 
causes of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg’s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals 
or soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . 
Though radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in 
patients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The 
combination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a 
specificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15].

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic foot pain is a frequent clinical complaint with approximately 14% to 42% of adults in the United States 
reporting foot problems, often with significant impact on mobility, difficulty performing daily activities , and 
increased risk of falling, particularly in older individuals [1,2] . Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a 
significant improvement in health-related quality of life with effective treatment of foot pain [3] . Estimating the 
prevalence of chron ic foot pain is challenging, because there is no consensus regarding the definition of chronic 
pain in the literature. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines chronic pain as any pain persisting 
past the normal healing time, suggesting 3 months in case of chronic pain of benign causes.  
Women are more commonly affected , and forefoot conditions are more frequent. Persistent pain for more than 6  
years has been reported in 51% of women between 70 to 75 years of age [4]. Because of  the wide range of causes 
of chronic foot pain, assessment of these patients with imaging studies in addition to a dedicated clinical 
examination is often needed [1] .

erosions,  although  limitations  exist  if an erosion  involves  an area of bone  that is inaccessible to US evaluation  [62]. 
There is evidence that US may have  higher  sensitivity  for detection  of gout compared  with DECT  in early  gout 
(duration <1 year)  [63]. US has also been  shown  to be helpful  in assessment  of tophus  resolution  in response to

[66]. CPPD  is thought  to have  high prevalence in the elderly  [67] but is underdiagnosed.  CPPD  joint involvement  
as defined  by EULAR  is when  CPP is detected  in the synovial  fluid  from  affected  joints  [66]. Diagnosis is often  
challenging;  however,  because the reference standard  of synovial  fluid  analysis has been  shown  to have  a high

Page Content: US is also useful  in the evaluation  for synovitis  and tenosynovitis,  aided  by the detection  of hyperemia via color  or 
Doppler  signal  [23]. Power  Doppler  US is more  accurate for the diagnosis  of synovitis  and has a higher  correlation  
with disease activity  compared  with grayscale US [35,36] . Synovitis  on power  Doppler  US and grayscale US are 
both associated  with the development  of radiographic  erosions  in patients  with RA compared  with grayscale US 
[37,38] . Newer  techniques  for detecting  microvascularization  associated  with joint inflammation  like multimodal  
photoacoustic/ US and ultra-microangiography have  shown  promise  as indicators  of disease activity  [39,40] . 
US also provides  prognostic  information  (such  as detecting  synovitis)  that is linked to disease progression [13], 
although  mild synovial  hypertrophy as an isolated  finding  is not specific and has limited  relevance [41]. In the 
evaluation  of the finger  joints  with US, dorsal  evaluation  is recommended  over palmar  [42]. Abbreviated  US

preferred  method for evaluation  of RA [18]. 
US has been  used to evaluate for osseous abnormalities  in the setting  of chronic  inflammatory  arthritis. Compared  
with radiography,  US has been  shown  to demonstrate a 6.5-fold  increase in the number  of detected  erosions of the 
metacarpophalangeal  joints  [12], but it is less accurate when  compared  with CT [11]. The f alse-positive  rate for US 
in detection  of metacarpophalangeal  joint erosions  has been  reported  as high as 29% [29]. Regardless,  large  erosions  
identified  with US at the second  and third  metacarpophalangeal  joints, the distal  ulna,  and the fifth 
metatarsophalangeal  joint are highly specific for and predictive  of RA [30]. US may also show  imaging  findings  
associated  with enthesitis  [25], with findings  of enthesitis  on power  Doppler  imaging  having  an accuracy  of 85.6% 
in distinguishing  peripheral  spondyloarthritis  versus nonspondyloarthropathy [31]. Studies  have  also found US to 
be helpful  in differentiating  RA and psoriatic  arthritis  [32,33] ; for example,  enthesitis  is a finding often  seen in

2. Explanation: Given the patient's age, history of prolonged foot pain, and physical examination findings, an MRI of the right foot is usually appropriate. The patient's symptoms suggest a possible stress fracture or injury, which is consistent with her history of brisk walking. MRI is a sensitive and specific imaging modality for detecting stress fractures and other soft tissue injuries. According to the ACR chronic foot pain guidelines, while radiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture, MRI remains a reliable method for diagnosing such conditions, especially when radiographs are negative or equivocal.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic foot pain is a frequent clinical complaint with approximately 14% to 42% of adults in the United States 
reporting foot problems, often with significant impact on mobility, difficulty performing daily activities , and 
increased risk of falling, particularly in older individuals [1,2] . Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a 
significant improvement in health-related quality of life with effective treatment of foot pain [3] . Estimating the 
prevalence of chron ic foot pain is challenging, because there is no consensus regarding the definition of chronic 
pain in the literature. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines chronic pain as any pain persisting 
past the normal healing time, suggesting 3 months in case of chronic pain of benign causes.  
Women are more commonly affected , and forefoot conditions are more frequent. Persistent pain for more than 6  
years has been reported in 51% of women between 70 to 75 years of age [4]. Because of  the wide range of causes 
of chronic foot pain, assessment of these patients with imaging studies in addition to a dedicated clinical 
examination is often needed [1] .

Guideline: ACR chronic foot pain.pdf, Page: 8
Page Content: Of these, foot fractures were found most frequently in the calcaneus and metatarsals, and 
less frequently in the navicular, cuboid , and cuneiform bones.  
On US, several findings have been reported in cases of painful accessory ossicles, including patients with posterior 
ankle impingement syndrome ; however , optimal characterization of the synchondrosis is difficult on US [62] . High -
resolution US offers some advantages over other imagin g modalities because it allows dynamic exploration of the 
foot with further assessment of stability of the synchondrosis and tendon tears when present as well as direct clinical 
correlation and comparative evaluation with the asymptomatic foot [77] . Power Doppler US has proven useful in 
identifying increased blood supply in the setting of ankle impingement [78,79] . 
Variant 6: Chronic foot pain. Entrapment s yndromes. Radiographs negative or equivocal. Clinical concern 
includes Baxter’s neuropathy. Next imaging study.  
Bone Scan Foot with SPECT/CT  
There is no relevant  literature supporting the use of nuclear medicine studies in the diagnosis of Baxter’s neuropathy.  
CT Foot  
There is no relevant literature supporting the use of CT , either with or without contrast in the diagnosis of Baxter’s  
neuropathy.  
MRI Foot  
Compression of the infe rior calcaneal nerve or Baxter’s neuropathy manifests as denervation changes of the 
abductor digiti minimi muscle. Because of  its ability to demonstrate signal intensity changes in the presence of 
muscle denervation, MRI has been sho wn to be useful in the dia gnosis of patients with Baxter’s neuropathy and in 
the exclusion of other causes of foot pain [23] . However, fatty atrophy of the abductor digiti minimi muscle is not 
a specific sign of Baxter’s neuropathy and can be found in 4% of asymptomatic subjects [80]. Contrast 
administration is not routinely performed in the initial assessment of neuropathic syndromes.

Guideline: ACR chronic foot pain.pdf, Page: 4
Page Content: Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  
usually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, 
osteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite 
versus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess 
with radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton’s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other 
causes of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg’s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals 
or soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . 
Though radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in 
patients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The 
combination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a 
specificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15]. 
US Foot  
Ultrasound (US) is usually not indicate d as the first imaging  study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain, but may 
be performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of pathologic conditions of the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, 
and other conditions such as tarsal tunnel syndrome, Morton’s  neuroma , plantar plate tears,  and intermetatarsal 
bursitis. 
Variant 2: Persistent posttraumatic foot pain. Radiographs negative or equivocal. Clinical concern includes 
complex regional pain syndrome type I. Next imaging study.  
3-Phase Bone Scan Foot  
A 3-phase bone scan may be useful in cases of suspected complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type I reflex 
sympathetic dystrophy , and several imaging findings have been described.

There is no r elevant literature  to support the use of MRI as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot

Radiography Foot  
Conventional radiography can be useful to distinguish among different causes of chronic foot pain and is usually 
the first imag ing study in evaluating patients with chronic foot pain.  
The value of radiographs in the diagnosis of tarsal coalitions has been extensively demonstrated. Overall 
sensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs 
in the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral 
and oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar 
coalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs 
on the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have 
been found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable 
methods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  
Radiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review 
by Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for 
radiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.

sesamoiditis and avascular necrosis [32,33] . 
The most commonly used imaging techniques in the diagnosis of Morton’s  neuroma  are MRI and US. It has been 
shown that MRI has a significant effect in the diagnostic and therapeutic decisions made by orthopedic surgeons 
thanks to an increase in their confidence levels and change in treatment [34] . MRI is believed to be a sensitive and 
reliable method to evaluate patients with metatarsalgia and Morton’s  neuroma  with a sensitivity of 87%, specificity 
of 100%, accuracy of 89%, PPV of 100% , and NPV of 60% in surgically treated patients [35] . In a meta- analysis,  
MRI had  a pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio , and negative likelihood ratio of 93%, 68%, 1.89,  
and 0.19, respectively [36]. Increased fluid within the intermetatarsal bursa, which suggest s bursitis, is well 
demonstrated on MRI [37] . Although the use of gadolinium does not seem essential to detect Morton’s  neuroma s 
[38], it may facilitate its detection  because of  the improved soft -tissue contrast [32,39] . 
MRI is widely accepted as the imaging study  of choice for diagnosis of plantar plate tears. In a prospective study, 
Sung et al [40] found high accuracy (96%), sensitivity (95%), specificity (100%), PPV (100%), and NPV (67%) for 
MRI with surgical correlation. In this study,  moderate concordance was found between tear severity on MR I and 
surgery with greater concordance at higher severity. A meta-analysis showed higher diagnostic accuracy for MRI 
than US for the detection of plantar plate tears with sensitivity and specificity for MRI of 95% and 54%, respectively

MRI Foot  
MRI allows accurate characterization of the pl antar fascia and adjacent soft -tissues and bones, and several imaging 
findin gs have been described in patients with plantar fasciitis and partial or complete tears of the plantar fascia on 
MRI [52]. Given that, some of the find ings in patients with plantar fasciitis are nonspecific; these findings can also 
be seen in asymptomatic patients.  MRI should always be correlated with clinical symptoms to avoid overcalling 
plantar fasciitis. Although no significant differences have been found in plantar fascia thickness on US and MRI, 
MRI is currently considered the most sensitive imaging study  in the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis [53]. There is no 
relevant literature supporting the routine use of contrast in the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis or tears.  
US Foot  
US has shown good sensitivity (80%) and specificity (88%) in the dia gnosis of plantar fasciitis when compared to 
MRI [54]. A diagnostic accuracy of 69% for abnormal focal echogenicity within the plantar fascia, 60% for edema 
around the plantar fascia, 78% for perifascial edema, 69% for rupture of the plantar fascia,  and 56% for an associated 
calcaneal spur have been found for US, using MRI as the reference standard [55]. Kapoor et al [56]  showed higher 
sensitivity and specificity of US elastography when compared to US in the detection of plantar fasciitis (95% and 
100% versus 66% and 75%, respectively) , using  MRI as the reference standard. US has been shown to be useful in 
the diagnosis of complete and partial tears of the plantar fascia [57].

Bone Scan Foot with SPECT or SPECT/CT  
SPECT/CT has been found to be of use when investigating heel pain with increased specificity when compared to 
bone scintigraphy alone , because of  the improved anatomic localization of metabolic activity. Despite the anatomic 
and functional advantages of SPECT/CT, MRI and high-frequency US remain the most frequently used imaging  
modalities in patients with heel pain [50]. A characteristic p attern of abnormal uptake on 3-phase bone scintigraphy 
has been proven helpful to differentiate plantar fasciitis from calcaneal stress or avulsion fractures [51]. There is no 
relevant literature  to support the routine use of nuclear medicine studies to diagnose plantar fascia l tears.

including nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing—may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value 
in patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68]. In rare cases of secondary carpal tunnel syndrome, MRI may identify 
a mass lesion compressing the median nerve. There is some evidence that the length of T2 hyperintensity in the 
median nerve can help prognosticate the success of surgery [69] and that the shape and signal of the nerve predict 
clinical response to a steroid injection in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome [70 ]. MR neurography

Summary of Recommendations  
• Wrist radiographs are indicated as the best initial imaging examination in patients with chronic wrist pain. 
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal and a patient has persistent symptoms wi th an unclear diagnosis, 
MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate.  
• In patients with suspected inflammatory arthritis, MRI either with or without IV contrast is usually 
appropriate if guidance for management or prognostication is needed.  
• Patients with  suspected wrist infection should undergo aspiration.

US Wrist 
Several meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the 
carpal  tunnel  inlet) is highly accurate for identifying carpal  tunnel syndrome  diagnosed clinically or with the 
combination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US 
varies depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the 
measurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary 
examination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel 
syndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal 
tunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, 
clinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of 
carpal tunnel syndrome. US may be appropriate in cases where this initial evaluation is equivocal.  
MRI Wrist  
Historically, carpal tunnel syndrome has been diagnosed based on clinical signs and sympt oms and confirmed by 
the results of electrodiagnostic studies [67]. MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in cases in which this  
initial evaluation is equivocal.

Page Content: These factors make CT the 
preferred examination for suspected distal radioulnar joint subluxation, where images of both wrists can be  
obtained in both supination and pronation [1 ,13]. A disadvantage of CT  is its lower sensitivity to soft -tissue 
abnormalities  compared with MRI.  
High-resolution (typically multidetector) CT of the wrist following contrast injection into one or more wrist 
compartments (CT arthrography) is a powerful tool for diagnosing intra -articular abnormalities [14,15]. The 
intraobserver agreement on CT arthrogram images is extremely high and better than that reported for MRI 
[14,16]. 
US 
US of the wrist is useful for examining extra -articular soft tissues, such as suspected ganglion cyst s [17], because 
its accuracy is similar to that of MRI. US can also be used to diagnose abnormalities of the flexor and extensor 
tendons and tendon sheaths. For de Quervain disease (stenosing tenosynovitis of the abductor pollicis lon gus and 
extensor pollicis brevis tendon compartment), preoperative identification of a septum or subcompartmentalization 
within the first dorsal compartment with US  may affect surgical management [18 ,19]. 
In patients with suspected or established rheumatoid arthritis (RA), US examination of the wrist and selected 
finger joints can identify erosions and active synovit is (with the use of power Doppler), findings that influence 
early diagnosis and treatment decisions [20]. Using US to measure the size of the median nerve is a  validated  
technique in patients with clinical symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome [21-24].  
In addition, w rist US is a useful technique to guide therapeutic intr a-articular and other soft -tissue injections [25].

Page Content: Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. 
Additionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ]. 
In the past , fluoroscopic observation was used to establish the diagnosis of dynamic wrist inst ability. However, in 
most practices,  fluoroscopy is used either for g uidance during wrist injections  or as an adjunct to arthrography.  
Percutaneous aspiration of the wrist —which is indicated in cases of suspected septic arthritis or to assess for intra-
articular crystals—can be carried out with either fluoroscopic or ultrasound (US) guidance  if needed . 
Scintigraphy  
Bone scintigraphy has been used for diagnosing occult wrist fractures and as a screening procedure in patients 
with wrist pain and negative radi ographs. However, while it is sensitive to bone abnormalities, scintigraphy 
suffers from a lack of specificity [6 ]. Furthermore, bone scans cannot detect soft -tissue abnormalities  such as  
lesions of the ligaments, tendons, and cartilage, all of which are often responsible for chronic wrist pain.  
Arthrography  
Conventional (x-ray) arthrography can be performed with contrast injection into the radiocarpal joint al one or into 
the radiocarpal, mi dcarpal, and distal radioulnar joints ( 3-phase technique) for the diagnosis of triangular 
fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tear and intrinsic ligament perforations. A recent meta -analysis found only 
moderate pooled sensitivity (76%) for the detection of full -thickness TFCC tears (82% for 3 -phase technique and 
72% for single -injection arthrograms)  [7]. However, arthrography is unable to reliably show the size, shape, and 
stability of TFCC defects and is insensitive to partial-thickness tears.

Both traumatic and degenerative lesions of the TFCC can produce chronic, ulnar -sided wrist pain . MRI is highly 
accurate for lesions involving the radial (central) zone of the disc, especially with the use of high -resolution fast 
spin-echo or 3-D grad ient-recalled pulse sequences [36]. There is some evidence suggesting that MRI performed 
with a 3.0 T system is even more accurate than MRI performed with a 1.5 T system for TFCC lesions [37], but 
there are no studies comparing the accuracy of the two field s trengths in the same patients. The sensitivity for 
tears of the ulnar attachment of the disc and the peripheral attachments (the ulnocarpal ligaments) are only fair 
with noncontrast -enhanced wrist MRI [ 12,36].

Aspiration  Wrist  
No literature directly addresses the appropriateness of imaging studies beyond radiographs in patients with 
suspected infection in the wrist. However, generalizing from experience with septic arthrit is in other joints, joint 
aspiration should not be delayed in order to obtain advanced imaging studies. In cases of suspected septic arthritis, 
percutaneous aspiration of the wrist is indicated, even when radiographs appear normal. Aspirates should be 
analyzed by cell count, gram stain, and appropriate cultures. Microscopic crystal analysis should also be obtained 
if there is a possibility of gout, acute pseudogout, or hydroxyapatite deposition disease. Aspiration can be 
performed without imaging guidance i f the joint is distended, but either fluoroscopy or US  may be useful if a 
specific compartment is to be targeted.

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  hip pain is a common chief  complaint  for patients , reportedly affecting  30% to 40% of adults  who play 
sports  [1,2] , and 12% to 15% of all adults  over 60 [3,4] . A wide variety  of pathological  entities  may cause hip pain, 
including  osseous  as well as intra- or extra -articular  soft tissue abnormalities  [5-7]. Pathology  involving  the lumbar  
spine,  sacroiliac,  or knee  joints  can also cause hip pain [8], and these  etiologies  should  be investigated  as needed . 
There is limited  original  research  that specifically  targets the imaging  of chronic  hip pain,  but imaging  of specific  
conditions  is widely  discussed  in the published  literature. 
Before  imaging,  an appropriate  assessment  of a patient’s  clinical  history  and physical  examination  is essential  in 
trying  to pare down the range  of possible etiologies  for a patient’s  symptoms.

Guideline: ACR chronic hip pain.pdf, Page: 10
Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 10 Chronic  Hip Pain Radiography Hip Additional Views 
For further evaluation  of disorders  such as dysplasia or FAI, specialized  views such as the false  profile  or elongated  
femoral  neck  lateral  (Dunn)  views  can provide  more  detailed  evaluation  of the anatomy  of the femoral  head  and 
neck  and the degree of acetabular  coverage of the femoral  head  [47]. 
US Hip 
In general,  US is limited  in its use for evaluating  osseous structures.  However,  there is limited  literature  that 
demonstrates that US can be used to evaluate osseous features of FAI such as the alpha -angle  [73]. However,  US is 
not able to adequately  evaluate osseous abnormalities  deep  to the cortex.  One of the advantages  of US is its ability  
to dynamically  evaluate for extra-articular  soft tissue  impingement.  US is not as sensitive as MRI or CT 
arthrography  for the detection  of labral  tears  [17], but it can be useful  for the detection  and localization  of paralabral  
cysts for aspiration  and injection  [39,41] . 
Variant  4: Chronic  hip pain. Suspect  labral tear.  Radiographs  negative  or nondiagnostic. Next  imaging

Bone  Scan  Hip 
There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of bone  scan of the hip for the workup of an acetabular  labral  tear 
in a patient  with chronic  hip pain.

symptom  duration,  pain patterns (eg, activity  or inactivity  related,  symptomatic  worsening  at night  or in the

assessing  a patient’s  range  of motion,  gait, and pain level  using a variety  of provocative  maneuvers is usually  
performed . Following  a history and physical  examination,  targeted  imaging  can play a vital role in distinguishing  
the etiologies  of a patient’s  symptoms,  thus allowing  appropriate  treatment  of the patient’s  underlying condition . 
Bone  tumors —both malignant  and benign—may  be identified  as part of the initial diagnostic  evaluation  of a patient  
presenting  with chronic  hip pain.  A detailed  discussion  of the appropriate  imaging  workup  of primary  bone  tumors  
is covered  in the ACR  Appropriateness Criteria® topic  on “Primary  Bone  Tumors ” [9]. Systemic  disease  may also

used for preoperative assessment  of bony anatomy  in the setting  of FAI and hip dysplasia [42-44]. CT arthrography  
has been  shown  to be sensitive  for detection  of acetabular  labral  tears [17], which  may be associated  with FAI. CT 
arthrography has also been  shown  to be more  helpful  in identifying  chondral  lesions [16] when  compared  to MRI.

For further evaluation  of disorders  such as dysplasia or FAI, specialized  views such as the false  profile  or elongated

US Hip 
In general,  US is limited  in its use for evaluating  osseous structures.  However,  there is limited  literature  that 
demonstrates that US can be used to evaluate osseous features of FAI such as the alpha -angle  [73]. However,  US is 
not able to adequately  evaluate osseous abnormalities  deep  to the cortex.  One of the advantages  of US is its ability  
to dynamically  evaluate for extra-articular  soft tissue  impingement.  US is not as sensitive as MRI or CT 
arthrography  for the detection  of labral  tears  [17], but it can be useful  for the detection  and localization  of paralabral  
cysts for aspiration  and injection  [39,41] .

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  hip pain is a common chief  complaint  for patients , reportedly affecting  30% to 40% of adults  who play 
sports  [1,2] , and 12% to 15% of all adults  over 60 [3,4] . A wide variety  of pathological  entities  may cause hip pain, 
including  osseous  as well as intra- or extra -articular  soft tissue abnormalities  [5-7]. Pathology  involving  the lumbar  
spine,  sacroiliac,  or knee  joints  can also cause hip pain [8], and these  etiologies  should  be investigated  as needed . 
There is limited  original  research  that specifically  targets the imaging  of chronic  hip pain,  but imaging  of specific  
conditions  is widely  discussed  in the published  literature. 
Before  imaging,  an appropriate  assessment  of a patient’s  clinical  history  and physical  examination  is essential  in 
trying  to pare down the range  of possible etiologies  for a patient’s  symptoms.",True

1. Classification: USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE
2. Explanation: According to the ACR Appropriateness Criteria for Chronic Knee Pain, an MRI with and without IV contrast is usually not appropriate for patients with chronic knee pain and initial radiographs demonstrating degenerative changes. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a degenerative process, which is confirmed by the initial radiographs. The use of IV contrast is not typically necessary in this scenario.
3. Recommendation: MRI knee without IV contrast would be a more appropriate next step. This imaging modality is usually appropriate for further evaluation of degenerative changes and can provide detailed information about the soft tissues, cartilage, and bone marrow without the need for IV contrast.",USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE,MRI knee without IV contrast,"Guideline: ACR chronic knee pain.pdf, Page: 6

painful or asymptomatic knee not significantly different in patients 45 to 55 years of age [20,21]. 
Bone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the 
subchondral bone.  New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or 
patients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee 
pain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the 
origin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. 
Subchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed 
spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to 
elderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs 
often initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, 
and progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is 
suspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria
® 
topic on “ Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae ” [28]. 
Some patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using 
quantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs 
exhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ].

Special Imaging  Considerations  
Knee radiographs  should include at least one frontal projection of one or both knees (anteroposterior, Rosenberg, 
or tunnel), a tangential patellar view , and a lateral view of the affected knee [2,9]. Standing radiographs more 
accurately reflect medial and lateral compartment cartilage loss than supine radiographs with the posteromedial and posterolateral joint compartments  more accurately assessed using a weight -bearing flexion posteroanterior 
radiograph [9,10].

Summary of Literature Review  
Background/Introduction 
Chronic knee pain affects tens of millions of people  in the United States annually , with the pain sometimes highly 
disabling and often negatively impacting the patient’s quality of life. Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and 
it can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain 
with the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. 
Typically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain 
persists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  
imaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated 
that approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the 
prior year) radiographs [2 ].

1. Classification: USUALLY APPROPRIATE
2. Explanation: Given the patient's history of a knee sprain with persistent pain and instability, along with a positive anterior drawer test and a suggestion of an old Segond fracture on X-ray, an MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate. This imaging modality is excellent for evaluating soft tissue structures such as the ACL and menisci, which are likely to be involved given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

To evaluat e knee pain associated with other conditions, please refer to the following ACR Appropriateness 
Criteria® topic on:  “Osteonecrosi s of the Hip ” [3] for osteonecrosis,  “Acute Trauma to the Knee ” for acute knee 
injuries  [4], “Imaging After Total Knee Arthroplasty ” for patients with total knee arthroplasty  [5], “Soft-Tissue

or known bone tumor [ 7], and “ Chronic Extremity Joint Pain -Suspected Inflammatory Arthritis ” for patient with 
suspected arthritis  or synovitis [ 8]. 
Special Imaging  Considerations  
Knee radiographs  should include at least one frontal projection of one or both knees (anteroposterior, Rosenberg, 
or tunnel), a tangential patellar view , and a lateral view of the affected knee [2,9]. Standing radiographs more 
accurately reflect medial and lateral compartment cartilage loss than supine radiographs with the posteromedial and posterolateral joint compartments  more accurately assessed using a weight -bearing flexion posteroanterior 
radiograph [9,10].

Bone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the 
subchondral bone.  New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or 
patients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee 
pain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the 
origin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. 
Subchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed 
spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to 
elderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs 
often initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, 
and progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is 
suspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria
® 
topic on “ Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae ” [28]. 
Some patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using 
quantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs 
exhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ].

Glenohumeral  osteoarthritis  is typically  well visualized  on conventional  radiographic  views,  without  the need  for 
special  views.  A standard  axillary  view can demonstrate posterior  subluxation of the humeral  head  and abnormal  
glenoid morphology in patients with severe osteoarthritis  [145-147] . A measurement  of the critical shoulder  angle  
can be drawn  on routine  AP radiographs  by measuring  the angle  between  a line along the glenoid  surface and a line 
from  the inferior glenoid to the lateral  acromial  margin;  patients  with a higher  measurement  may be at high risk of 
having a full thickness rotator  cuff tear [148] .

infraspinatus  tendon,  and 64.7%  and 98.2%  for the subscapularis tendon  [15]. CT arthrography provides  a 
comparable alternative  to MR arthrography in the evaluation  of rotator  cuff tendon tears [16,17] . CT arthrography 
is able to detect  very subtle  articular  surface cuff defects,  but, because of lack of contrast  extension  from  the

2. Explanation: The patient presents with chronic shoulder pain and stiffness, which are symptoms suggestive of adhesive capsulitis. The initial radiographs were inconclusive. According to the ACR Appropriateness Criteria, MRI arthrography of the shoulder may be appropriate in this scenario. However, it's worth noting that there can be limitations in detecting adhesive capsulitis due to the arthrogram injection itself. MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate and can show characteristic findings of adhesive capsulitis. US shoulder can also be used to exclude rotator cuff tear, although it's not typically performed specifically for adhesive capsulitis.

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  shoulder  pain lasting  >6 months  is a common  presenting  complaint , particularly  in patients  ≥40 years of 
age [1]. Along with a thorough history and physical  examination,  imaging  plays  a critical  role in determining the 
source of chronic  shoul der pain.  Common pain generators in the shoulder  include  the rotator  cuff tendons,  biceps 
tendon,  labrum,  glenohumeral  articular  cartilage,  acromioclavicular  joint, bones,  suprascapular  and axillary  nerves,  
and the joint capsule/synovium.  Imaging  can help to guide  appropriate  therapy , which  can range  from  conservative  
measures such as physical  therapy  and cortico steroid  injections  to more  invasive  procedures  such as arthroscopy or 
surgery . This document  focuses on the imaging approach  to patients  with suspected  chronic  mechanical  shoulder  
pain.

fluid  within  the rotator  interval  or along  the axillary  recess due to the arthrogram  injection  itself  can serve as a

MRI Shoulder  Without  and With  IV Contrast  
Contrast -enhanced  MRI can increase the conspicuity of axillary  recess capsular  thickening [110]  and rotator  interval  
soft-tissue thickening [111] , although there  are conflicting  data on the relationship  of this capsular  enhancement

Scan ordered:   ","MRI shoulder without and with IV contrast

1. Classification: USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE
2. Explanation: According to the ACR Appropriateness Criteria, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of MRI shoulder without and with IV contrast in the evaluation of chronic shoulder pain with a history of prior rotator cuff repair when a rotator cuff disorder or subacromial subdeltoid bursitis is suspected. The patient's symptoms and history suggest a possible rotator cuff disorder or subacromial subdeltoid bursitis, and he has a history of prior rotator cuff repair. Therefore, the ordered scan is usually not appropriate.
3. Recommendation: MRI Shoulder Without IV Contrast or US Shoulder would be more appropriate imaging studies in this case. MRI without IV contrast can demonstrate complications with suture anchors such as osteolysis or migration, even if the suture anchors are nonmetallic.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 16 Chronic Shoulder Pain  MRI Shoulder  Without  and With  IV Contrast  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of MRI  shoulder  without  and with IV contrast  in the evaluation  of 
chronic  shoulder  pain with a history  of prior  rotator  cuff repair  when  a rotator  cuff disorder  or subacromial  
subdeltoid bursitis  is suspected.  
MRI Shoulder  Without  IV Contrast  
MRI is useful  in the evaluation  of the postoperative  rotator  cuff. The shift from  metallic  to bioabsorbable  suture  
anchors  tends  to result  in fewer  cases  with metal  artifact  implications  [153] . For patients  with meta llic suture  
anchors,  there are a variety  of commercially  available metal  artifact  reduction sequences,  which  can limit artifact.  
MRI can demonstrate  complications  with suture  anchors  such as osteolys is or migration  [154] , even  if the suture  
anchors  are nonmetallic . MRI can also demonstrate potential improvements  in muscle  atrophy and fatty infiltration  
after rotator  cuff repair  [155,156] .  
Radiography Shoulder  Additional Views  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of additional  radiographic  views in the evaluation  of chronic  
shoulder  pain with a history  of prior  rotator  cuff repair  when  rotator  cuff disorder  or subacromial  subdeltoid bursitis  
is suspected.  
US Shoulder  
An advantage  of US evaluation  of the postoperative  shoulder  is the absence  of metal -induced artifact  when  
examining the rotator  cuff and adjacent  soft tissues.  Patients  who have  undergone  rotator  cuff repair  may show  
discrete defects on US imaging  that may persist  for years with some  potential for delayed  healing  [157] .

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 15 Chronic Shoulder Pain  Radiography Shoulder  Additional Views  
Glenohumeral  osteoarthritis  is typically  well visualized  on conventional  radiographic  views,  without  the need  for 
special  views.  A standard  axillary  view can demonstrate posterior  subluxation of the humeral  head  and abnormal  
glenoid morphology in patients with severe osteoarthritis  [145-147] . A measurement  of the critical shoulder  angle  
can be drawn  on routine  AP radiographs  by measuring  the angle  between  a line along the glenoid  surface and a line 
from  the inferior glenoid to the lateral  acromial  margin;  patients  with a higher  measurement  may be at high risk of 
having a full thickness rotator  cuff tear [148] . 
US Shoulder  
Although secondary  signs  of osteoarthritis  such as osteophytes,  joint effusion , and intra-articular  bodies  can be seen 
with US [142] , it is not typically  performed  for this indication.  
Variant  8: Chronic  shoulder  pain. History  of prior  rotator  cuff repair.  Suspect  rotator  cuff disorders or 
subacromial  subdeltoid bursitis. Initial radiographs  normal  or inconclusive. Next  imaging  study.  
Bone  Scan  Shoulder  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of bone  scan shoulder  in the evaluation  of chronic  shoulder  pain 
with a history  of prior  rotator  cuff repair  when  rotator  cuff disorder  or subacromial  subdeltoid bursitis  is suspected.  
CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
As in the native  shoulder,  CT arthrography can be used to evaluate for rotator  cuff tear after surgery .

Guideline: ACR chronic shoulder pain.pdf, Page: 16
Page Content: Despite  
these limitations, US still provides  an excellent  method  to assess repair  integrity, with a high sensitivity  (80.8%)  
and specificity  (100%)  for recurrent  rotator  cuff tear [158] . The ability  to perform  provocative  maneuvers can 
further demonstrate abnormalities  that other  forms  of imaging  would be incapable  identifying.  
Summary  of Recommendations 
• Variant 1 : Radiography is usually appropriate for the initial imaging of chronic shoulder pain.  
• Variant 2 : US or MR arthrography or MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study 
in the evaluation of chronic shoulder pain when  radiographs are normal or inconclusive and rotator cuff 
disorders or subacromial subdeltoid bursitis (no prior surgery)  is suspected . These procedures are equivalent 
alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage 
the patient’s care).  
• Variant 3 : Image -guided anesthetic +/ - corticosteroid injection  is usually appropriate as the next imaging study 
in the evaluation of chronic shoulder pain when radiographs demonstrate calcific tendinopathy or calcific bursitis. 
• Variant 4 : MR arthrography or MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study in the 
evaluation of chronic shoulder pain when radiographs are normal or inconclusive and labral pathology or shoulder instability is suspected.  These procedures a re equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be 
ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 5 : Image -guided anesthetic +/ - corticosteroid injection or MRI without IV contrast is usually 
appropri ate as the next imaging study in the evaluation of chronic shoulder pain when radiographs are normal 
or inconclusive and adhesive capsulitis is suspected.  These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one 
procedure will be ordered to provide the c linical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).

CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
CT arthrography  has shown  good diagnostic  performance for depicting  rotator  cuff tendon  tears with a reported  
respective sensitivity  and specificity  of 99% and 100%  for the supraspinatus  tendon,  97.4%  and 99.5%  for the 
infraspinatus  tendon,  and 64.7%  and 98.2%  for the subscapularis tendon  [15]. CT arthrography provides  a 
comparable alternative  to MR arthrography in the evaluation  of rotator  cuff tendon tears [16,17] . CT arthrography 
is able to detect  very subtle  articular  surface cuff defects,  but, because of lack of contrast  extension  from  the 
glenohumeral  joint space,  it is less effective at demonstrating bursal  surface or intrasubstance tears,  which  are 
typically  well seen with MRI or US [18]. 
CT Shoulder  With  IV Contrast

Page Content: Initial imaging.  
A symptomatic primary shoulder arthroplasty has a wide variety of potential etiologies that includ es loosening, 
infection, periprosthetic fracture, and rotator cuff tear. Periprosthetic  fractures of the glenoid  and humerus  can occur  
intraoperatively  as well as postoperatively.  Complications  related  to surgical  technique,  such as excessive  reaming  
or impaction,  are the most  common  reasons for fractures in the intraoperative  setting,  with a reported  incidence of 
2.1%  [6]. In the postoperative setting, a 1% incidence  of periprosthetic  fractures  has been  reported;  patients’  other  
medical  comorbidities  (assessed  using the Deyo -Charlson  index)  are found to be significant  risk factors [10,19] . 
Humeral  fractures  have  been  found to be more  common than glenoid fractures.  Fractures of the acromion  and spine  
of the scapula are more  common  in the setting  of reverse total shoulder  arthroplasty  and are thought  to be related  to 
an intraoperative  complication  or, more  commonly,  chronic  stress [4]. 
3-Phase  Bone  Scan  with  SPECT  or SPECT/CT Shoulder  
There is no relevant literature to support the use of a 3 -phase bone scan with SPECT or SPECT/CT as a first-line 
imaging modality in the acutely symptomatic patient with a primary shoulder arthroplasty.  Similar  to bone  scans,  a 
3-phase bone  scan is highly sensitive for the detection  of periprosthetic  fractures  but suffers  from  low specificity.

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  hip pain is a common chief  complaint  for patients , reportedly affecting  30% to 40% of adults  who play 
sports  [1,2] , and 12% to 15% of all adults  over 60 [3,4] . A wide variety  of pathological  entities  may cause hip pain, 
including  osseous  as well as intra- or extra -articular  soft tissue abnormalities  [5-7]. Pathology  involving  the lumbar  
spine,  sacroiliac,  or knee  joints  can also cause hip pain [8], and these  etiologies  should  be investigated  as needed . 
There is limited  original  research  that specifically  targets the imaging  of chronic  hip pain,  but imaging  of specific  
conditions  is widely  discussed  in the published  literature. 
Before  imaging,  an appropriate  assessment  of a patient’s  clinical  history  and physical  examination  is essential  in 
trying  to pare down the range  of possible etiologies  for a patient’s  symptoms.

2. Explanation: The patient has a history of acute injury (fall) and is symptomatic post total hip arthroplasty. The initial imaging (X-rays) did not show any periprosthetic fracture or loosening. According to the ACR Appropriateness Criteria, an MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in this scenario. MRI can demonstrate femoral periprosthetic fractures and stress reactions. However, a non-displaced fracture may be difficult to see on MRI if there is only mild associated marrow edema, and susceptibility artifact from the prosthesis may obscure the pertinent findings. Therefore, while the MRI can provide additional information, its limitations should be considered.

2. Explanation: The patient is presenting with symptoms of hip pain and fever post hip hemiarthroplasty, which could indicate a possible infection. The patient's elevated total white blood cell count and CRP further support this suspicion. Although X-rays did not show any obvious signs of infection, they may not be sensitive enough to detect early or subtle changes. An MRI without IV contrast is a suitable imaging modality for this scenario as it can help in the detection, localization, quantification, and characterization of fluid collections, which are significant features of periprosthetic infection. It has been found to have high accuracy in the evaluation of periprosthetic joint infection (86%-91% accuracy). Furthermore, MRI can distinguish patients with infection from those with loosening using MRI features.

2. Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a possible diagnosis of trochanteric bursitis. The MRI without IV contrast is a suitable imaging modality for this condition as it can effectively evaluate soft tissues and peritrochanteric structures, including the trochanteric bursa. The literature supports the use of non-contrast MRI for this purpose, and it is generally considered a safe and effective imaging modality for this condition. Furthermore, the patient's X-rays did not show any signs of periprosthetic fracture or loosening, which further supports the use of MRI to evaluate for soft tissue abnormalities.

Fluoride  PET/CT Skull Base to Mid-Thigh 
There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of fluoride  PET/CT skull base to mid-thigh in the evaluation  of 
chronic  hip pain thought  to be due to a noninfectious  extra-articular  abnormality.  
Image -Guided Anesthetic +/- Corticosteroid  Injection  Hip Joint  or Surrounding  Structures  
Fluoroscopic -, CT-, or US-guided anesthetic and/or  corticosteroid  injections  can be a useful  tool for the diagnosis  
of chronic  hip pain.  In addition to intra-articular  injections,  selective trochanteric and iliopsoas  bursal/peritendinous  
injections  can be performed  for diagnostic  purposes  using anesthetic and/or  corticosteroid  injectate,  respectively.  
Symptomatic  relief  following  selective injection  of particular  structure(s)  can help to define  the etiology  of the 
patient’s  symptoms  and guide  future  therapy [19-22].

of the hip.  
MRI Hip Without IV Contrast  
MRI without  IV contrast  is useful  for evaluating  soft tissues  given its high soft tissue contrast  resolution  [23].

Variant  7: Hip arthroplasty  patient  with  trochanteric pain. Suspect  abductor  injury , or trochanteric bursitis , 
or other soft tissue abnormality . Additional imaging  following  radiographs.  
Postoperative  greater  trochanter  pain may be due to greater  trochanteric bursitis, or other  etiologies  such as gluteus  
minimus  or medius  tendinitis , or tears or avulsion [73]. Trochanteric bursitis  is reported  to occur  in up to 17% of 
hips after THA and may be related  to the surgical  approach  [144,145] . 
CT Hip 
CT is less optimal  than MRI  for assessing  soft tissues [22]. Fractures and fluid  collections can be identified  on CT. 
Image -Guided Anesthetic +/- Corticosteroid  Injection  Hip Joint  or Surrounding  Structures  
If trochanteric bursitis  is thought  to be a source of pain,  Robbins  et al [144]  suggest  the bursa  may be injected  with 
either  lidocaine  alone  as a diagnostic  test, or in combination with a corticosteroid  as a therapeutic measure.  
MRI Hip 
MRI can be used to assess peritrochanteric structures including  the gluteus  minimus  and medius  muscles,  abductor  
tendons,  and the trochanteric bursa [146,147] . There is no relevant literature documenting the additional benefit of 
MRI with IV contrast, relative to noncontrast MRI, in this population.

Page Content: In a review,  Fritz  et al [18] noted  that radiographs  are usual ly the first imaging  modality  for patients  with 
postoperative  lateral  hip pain.  Radiographs  help assess the presence of periprosthetic  fractures,  avulsions  of the 
greater  trochanter,  and heterotopic  ossification  [18]. Radiographs  show ing >2 mm surface  irregularities  of the 
greater  trochanter  have  been  reported  with abductor  tendon abnormalities  and peritendinous  edema on MRI [62]. 
However,  a review of 38 cases of greater  trochanter  pain syndrome  and 100 controls  showed  the findings  of 
trochanteric surface irregularities  including spurs  protruding 2 mm were associated  with a 24.7%  PPV, 64.0%  
sensitivity, 25.7%  specificity, 74.3%  false-positive  rate, 36.0%  false-negative  rate, and 65.3%  negative  predicative  
value  (NPV) for clinical  greater  trochanteric pain syndrome  [63]. 
MoM hip prosthese s: The FDA notes  that in the symptomatic  patient following  insertion  of a MoM prosthesis,  
radiographs  in conjunction with nonimaging information,  may disclose the need  for revision  [44]. Metallosis  
resulting  from  severe wear  of a metal  on metal  articulation  may occasionally  be identified  on radiographs  [64]. 
Component  position  can be assessed  [65]. 
Mathar u et al [54] found hips with resurfacing  arthroplasties and symptomatic  pseudotumors  were more  likely  than 
those  without  pseudotumors  to have  abnormal  radiographs  (80.0%  compared  with 63.4%).  Radiographic  features

Page Content: Pfirrmann  et al [147]  compared  the MRI  findings  about  the greater  trochanter  in 25 patients after primar y THA 
without  pain and 39 patients  with trochanteric pain and abductor  weakness.  Although several  abnormalities  were 
seen in both symptomatic  and asymptomatic groups,  defects of the abductor  tendons  and fatty atrophy of the gluteus  
medius  muscle  and the posterior  part of the gluteus  minimus  muscle  were uncommon in asymptomatic patients.  
Comparison of MRI findings  with findings  at surgical  revision  in 14 patients  confirm ed all MRI tendon findings . 
Joint  distension  and decompression  of synovitis  into the greater  trochanteric bursa  and fluid  undermining the hip 
abductors  can be assessed  on MARS -MRI  [72]. Weber  et al [141]  noted that extracapsular  disease associated  with 
ARMD could be misinterpreted  as trochanteric  bursitis. 
Radiographic  Arthrography  Hip 
Weakness or detachment  of the abductor  muscles may occur  after THA using  an anterolateral  approach  [148] . 
Avulsion of the reattached  gluteus  medius  can provide  a communication between  the hip joint and the trochanteric 
bursa  that can be documented on arthrography [148] . Ylinen  et al [148]  found that all 14 patients  with this 
communication had abductor  avulsion  at revision  surgery.  A negative  study  did not exclude disruption  (sensitivity  
60.1%,  specificity  100%).  The failure  of contrast  to extend to the trochanteric region in these cases was attributed  
to blocking of its flow by a fibrous  capsule.

2. Explanation: Given the patient's history of a fall and severe pain in the left knee, along with the presence of a large suprapatellar effusion on X-ray, an MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate to assess for a radiographically occult periprosthetic fracture. This is especially important considering the patient's history of total knee replacement 4 years ago. The MRI can provide detailed images of the knee joint and surrounding structures, helping to identify any potential fractures or other injuries that may not be visible on X-ray.

Page Content: Around  10% to 30% of the 
patients  report  ongoing pain or are not satisfied  with the result  [9]. Factors,  which  contribute  to patient  
dissatisfaction , include  unmet  expectations,  functional  limitations,  and postoperative  complications  including pain 
[10]. Most  TKA  patients  expe rience improved outcomes  and long implant survival,  with long-term  TKA failure  
rates of <1% per year [5]. The growth in the number  of primary  TKA  procedures  has been  accompanied  by increased  
rates of TKA revision  procedures  [1]. Revision  procedures  for TKAs have  increased  by 5.4 procedures  per 100,000  
persons  per decade over the period from  1990  to 2002,  with a mean  revision  burden of 8.2%  [11]. Nearly  1.5 million  
of those  with primary  knee  replacement  are 50 to 69 years  of age, underscoring a large population at risk for revision  
surgery  and long-term  complications  [5]. Sharkey  et al [12] reviewed  781 revision  TKAs and found  the most  
common  failure  mechanisms  were  loosening (39.9%),  infection  (27.4%),  instability  (7.5%),  periprosthetic  fracture  
(4.7%),  and arthrofibrosis  (4.5%) . Infection  was the most  common  reason  for early  revision  (<2 years after the 
initial TKA) , and aseptic loosening was the most  common  reason  for late revision.

Guideline: ACR imaging after total knee arthroplasty.pdf, Page: 12
Page Content: Instabil ity usually  occurs because of surgical  error and/or  poor prosthesis selection  and often  
results in revision  surgery  an average of 4 years after the primary  arthroplasty  [21]. Severe instability  can result  in 
dislocation. In a 2014 review of 781 cases of prosthesis failure,  Sharkey  et al [12] found that instability  represented  
the third  most  common  cause of prosthesis failure  overall,  accounting  for 7.5%  of all cases.  The concepts of 
instability, malalignment, and loosening in TKA are closely  interrelated  [117] . When  malalignme nt of the joint is 
created  at the time of surgery,  minor  degrees of instability  can become a significant  problem.  By the same  token,  
instability, ongoing over time, can give rise to malalignment, which,  in turn, can lead to loosening.  Although 
ligamentous  balance/imbalance plays  a role in joint instability, it is not the only factor  accounting for stability  [118] . 
3-Phase  Bone  Scan  Knee  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  routine  use of Tc-99m  3-phase bone  scans for the assessment  of instability.  
Bone  scintigraphy may be helpful  in diagnosing loosening,  especially  when  obtained many  years after surgery  [62]. 
This delay  in maximum utility  is because of  the observation that positive  bone  scans are noted in 20% of 
asymptomatic knees 1 year after surge ry and in 12.5%  of individuals  2 years after surgery [61] . Serial  bone  scans 
may be more  helpful  than a single  examination  [119] . Generally,  increased  uptake  on the delayed  images  but not 
on the blood- pool phase is thought  to be due to loosening rather  than to infection  [60].

Page Content: Compared  with a review  
performed  by the same  author  in 2002 [13], polyethylene  wear  is no longer  the major  cause  of failure , and the 
percentages of revisions  for polyethylene  wear,  instability, arthrofibrosis,  malalignment,  and extensor  mechanism  
deficiency  have  all decreased.  Identifying the cause of a painful  TKA  before  surgery  is critically  important  because  
“in cases of unexplained pain,  reoperation  is unwise and frequently  associated  with suboptimal  results” [14]. 
Special Imaging  Considerations   
In some  patients with knee  arthroplasties,  repeated  hemarthroses are caused  by synovial  hyperemia  or true 
arteriovenous  malformations.  These patients can be successfully  diagnosed with angiography and treated  with 
embolization. In rare instances,  geniculate and popliteal vessel  injuries  may occur  during surgery  [15]. 
A recent  study reports  single -photon emission  CT (SPECT)/CT  arthrography with Tc-99m  sulfur  colloid  has a high 
diagnostic  accuracy  (97%)  in the evaluation  of loosening of both hip and knee  arthroplasties in patients with 
persistent  postprocedural  pain [16]. Barnsley  et al [17] also found  arthrography  with SPECT/CT to be an accurate  
means of identifying  aseptic prosthetic  joint loosening .

Periprosthetic  fractures may occur  either  during or after surgery  and can involve  the femur,  tibia, or patella.  Among  
periprosthetic  fractures,  supracondylar  distal  femur  fractures are most  common,  whereas patellar  fractures are rare 
[135,136] . Supracondylar  fractures occur  in 0.3%  to 2.5%  of TKA,  usually  within  2 to 4 years after surgery,  and 
often  occur  in the setting  of low-energy  trauma  [136] . Tibial fractures  are associated  with loose  components  and 
malalignment.  Patellar  fractures are associated  with rheumatoid  arthritis, steroid  use, osteonecrosis,  and 
malalignment.  Most  patients  with periprosthetic  fractures are elderly,  having poor bone  stock.  Treatment  depends

Imaging of rotational instability  of a TKA is discussed  in greater  detail  under  Variant  5. If a patient  has undergone  
a full workup  and infection  has been  excluded,  then loosening should be considered  as the potential cause of knee  
pain and periprosthetic  lucency.  In multiple  studies,  aseptic loosening has been  found to be a common cause of 
TKA failure  [13,110-112] . Sharkey  et al [13] found  aseptic loosening to be the major  cause of late stage (>2 years)  
TKA failure.  Aseptic loosening may occur  either  because of inadequate  primary  fixation  or because of failure  after 
successful  fixation. It is thought  to result  from  mechanical  stresses,  osteolysis secondary  to particle  debris,  or poor 
bone  stock  [21]. Loosening may be closely  related  to other  forms  of mechanical  failure  such as osteolysis,",False

Page Content: Staphylococcus  aureus  and coagulase-negative  Staphylococcus  species,  including  Staphylococcus  epidermidis,  are 
the most  common organisms  associated  with these infections  [46]. Both  clinical  findings  and laboratory tests may 
serve useful  in addition  to imaging  studies.  Low-grade  or chronic  TKA  infections  may be difficult to diagnose  
preoperatively.  Duff  et al [18] noted that diagnosis  of infection  was not obvious  in 53% of knees before  revision  
arthroplasty.  Pain is the most  common  presenting  symptom  of infection, but pain is a nonspecific finding [47]. In 
acute infection,  findings  such as pain,  swelling,  warmth,  erythema,  and fever  are common,  whereas chronic  
infections  may be manifested  by pain alone  [44]. Night  pain or pain at rest is characteristic of infection, whereas  
pain on weightbearing  is more  characteristic of mechanical  loosening.  Some  authors  suggest  that infection  needs to 
be excluded  in all patients  with pain persisting  >6 months  after joint replacement  [18]. 
Laboratory findings  in the setting  of TKA infection  are often  nonspecific.  Peripheral  leukocyte  counts  are not 
elevated  in most  patients  with infected  prostheses.  Erythrocyte  sedimentation  rates (ESRs) are abnormal  in patients  
with infection, but this finding  may also be seen in uninfected  patients,  limiting  the usefulness of the test [48].

Page Content: A 
retrospective review of 68 patients  undergoing hip and knee  revision  surgery  indicated  that C-reactive protein  (CRP)  
was significantly  higher  in patients  with infection  compared  with those  with loosening (sensitivity  of 79% for all 
prostheses) ; however , a normal  CRP  level  did not exclude  infection  [49]. CRP  has a sensitivity  of 73% to 91% and 
a specificity  of 81% to 86% for the diagnosis  of prosthetic  knee  infection  when  a cutoff  of ≥13.5 mg/L  is used [44]. 
Although CRP  can be elevated  after surgery,  under  normal  circumstances  it generally  returns  to baseline within  2 
months  [44]. A large multicenter  study found CRP  and joint aspiration  to be the most  useful  tools  to diagnose  
infection  [50]. In an attempt  to construct  an algorithm  for evaluating  TKA infection,  Savarino  et al [51] found that 
abnormal  results  for at least 2 of 3 tests (CRP  [cutoff  0.93 mg/L],  ESR [cutoff 27 mm/h],  and fibrinogen  [cutoff  
432 mg/dL])  led to accurate results for the diagnosis  of infection  (sensitivity, 93%;  specificity,  100%;  accuracy,  
97%) . More  recently,  interle ukin-6  has also shown  promise  for diagnosing  infection , with higher  predictive  values 
than most  other  serologic  markers [52], and has shown  excellent  sensitivity  for detecting  infection  after TKA when  
combined with CRP  [53]. The American  Academy  of Orthopaedi c Surgeons  (AAOS ) guidelines  strongly  
recommend  the use of ESR, CRP , and serum  interleukin -6 testing  for patients  being assessed  for periprosthetic  joint 
infection  [54].

FDG-PET/CT scans may be useful  for detecting  infection  after joint replacement.  FDG-PET images reflect  relative  
levels of glucose uptake  and thus reflect  the localized  level  of increased  metabolic  activity. Zhuang  et al [68] 
reported  that elevated  glycolytic  activity  causes  inflammatory  cells such as neutrophils  and activated  macrophages  
to be FDG avid at sites of inflammation  and infection.  Some  periprosthetic  uptake  may occur  because of marrow  
activity, and adding marrow  scanning  can increase specificity  [69]. In these instances,  the marrow  study would be 
performed  the next day using a different  camera type because  the marrow  scan relies on lower  energy photons  (PET,

In the case of this patient, who has undergone limb salvage surgery for osteosarcoma, the use of IV contrast is not typically recommended. Furthermore, the patient does not present any symptoms or signs of recurrence such as a palpable mass at the operative site. Therefore, the use of IV contrast does not seem to be necessary in this case.
3. Recommendation: MRI knee without IV contrast would be a more appropriate imaging procedure for this patient. This procedure is usually appropriate for patients with a history of cartilage or meniscal repair, according to the ACR guidelines.",USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE,MRI knee without IV contrast,"Guideline: ACR osteonecrosis.pdf, Page: 3
Page Content: Anteroposterior,  lateral  (frog -leg lateral  for hip), and oblique  (eg, ankle/knee)  
views are recommended to exclude  subchondral  collapse in cases of epiphyseal  osteonecrosis  [27,28] . In late-stage  
osteonecrosis,  radiography will also show  findings  of secondary  osteoarthritis. 
Bone  Scan  Area  of Interest  
In recent  years,  bone  scintigraphy has been  replaced  by MRI for detection  of osteonecrosis because of  poor spatial  
resolution,  low specificity,  and the inability  to quantify size of the necrotic lesion  [29]. Single -photon emission  CT 
(SPECT) was shown  to improve  accuracy  of bone  scintigraphy  in a small  group of posttransplant  patients  [30], but 
radionucleotide  scintigraphy  is not commonly  performed  for detection  of osteonecrosis.  Early  limited  data for 
PET/ CT have not been  shown  to useful  in diagnosis  of early  osteonecrosis [31]. More  studies are needed  to see if 
PET/CT may be useful  in the detection  of multifocal osteonecrosis.  
CT Area  of Interest  With  IV Contrast  
There is limited  evidence to support  the use of CT with IV contrast  as the initial imaging  study for clinically  
suspected  osteonecrosis.

3-Phase  Bone  Scan  Knee  
Radionuclide  3-phase bone  scans can demonstrate  increased  activity  at a site of periprosthetic  fracture  and can show  
fractures that are radiographically occult  [137, 138]. In older  osteopen ic individuals  with low rates  of bone  
remodeling,  it may take 48 to 72 hours  for the development  of increased  radionuclide  activity  at the site of fracture.  
Within  1 to 2 years after prosthesis surgery,  the differential  diagnosis  for increased  periprosthetic  activity  would  
include  postoperative  change;  however,  with serial  imaging,  this postoperative activity  should decrease over time,  
whereas activity  increasing  over time would be suggestive of a prosthetic  complication, such as a periprosthetic  
fracture,  aseptic loosening,  or infection. Therefore,  no conclusion should  be drawn  on an isolated  bone  scan unless 
it yields  a normal  study.

There is no benefit  to intraarticular  contrast.

Page Content: Local  recurrence  rates  of bone  sarcomas  are reported  to be approximately  10% to 15% 
in patients  with osteosarcoma  and Ewing  sarcoma  [58-61]. Prognosis  is poor for locally  recurrent  malignant  or 
aggressive  bone  tumors,  with postrecurrence  5-year survival  rates  reported  approximately  15% to 30% in patients  
with osteosarcoma  and 5% in patients  with Ewing  sarcoma  [60,62] . Factors  associated  with poorer  prognosis  in 
patients  with osteosarcoma  were  size of local  recurrence  (>5 cm) and presence  of distant  metastasis  [60]. 
Recommendations  for local  recurrence  surveillance  imaging  vary amongst  expert  guidelines,  although  all 
acknowledge  the benefit  of clinical  evaluation.  Locally  recurrent  bone  tumors  can often  present  as a soft tissue  
mass,  and in a study  of osteosarcoma  local  recurrences,  the majority  (approximately  75%)  were  soft tissue  masses  
rather  than bone  lesions  [60]. Some  guidelines  recommend  clinical  exam ination  to be performed  solely , whereas  
others  recommend  in combination  with imaging  [49,51,52,63] . Time  to recurrence  also varies  with tumor  histology.  
Most  osteosarcoma  local  recurrences  have  been  shown  to occur  within  5 years  of resection.  However,  late 
recurrence  of both osteosarcoma  and Ewing  sarcoma  have  been  reported  [60,61] . In a study  of locally  recurrent  
osteosarcoma,  survival  rates  decreased  from  30% at 5 years  to 13% at 10 years,  suggesting  long-term follow -up 
beyond  5 years  is beneficial.

Page Content: FDG -PET/CT  Whole  Body  
A meta -analysis  of FDG -PET/CT  for the staging  of patients  with osteosarcoma  demonstrated  an overall  sensitivity  
of 93% and a specificity  of 97% for detection  of bone  metastases  [6]. Coverage  of a whole  body  FDG -PET/CT  
varies  and usually  extends  either  from  skull  base to thighs  or skull  vertex  to feet. A study  of FDG -PET/CT  in 
patients  with sarcoma  and melanoma  showed  inclusion  of the entire  lower  extremities  does not add additional  
benefit  in identifying  metastases  [31]. 
FDG -PET/CT  is considered  superior  to Tc-99m bone  scan in the detection  of osseous  metastases.  Literature  has 
concluded  this in both general  oncologic  and bone  sarcoma  populations  [30]. FDG -PET/C T is also superior  to CT 
imaging  in this regard.  Quartuccio  et al [22] studied  64 pediatric  patients  with bone  sarcoma  and found  greater  
accuracy  of FDG -PET/CT  (85%  accuracy)  versus  CT (44% accuracy)  in detecting  bone  metastases  during  initial  
staging  of patients  with Ewing  sarcoma.  There  are mixed  conclusions  when  comparing  FDG -PET/CT  versus  MRI

3. Recommendation: NO CHANGE REQUIRED",USUALLY APPROPRIATE,MRI spine area of interest without and with IV contrast,"Guideline: ACR low back pain.pdf, Page: 5
Page Content: Additionally,  guidelines  from  the American  College  
of Physicians and the American  Pain Society  [3,4]  emphasize a focused  history  and physical  examination,  
reassurance,  initial pain management  medications if necessary,  and consideration  of physical  therapies without  
routine  imaging  in patients  with nonspecific  LBP. Duration  of symptoms  also helps  guide  treatment  algorithms  in 
patients  with acute,  subacute,  or chronic  LBP. Additionally, assessment  of psychosocial  risk factors when  obtaining  
patient  history  is a strong predictor  of patients  who are predisposed  to developing chronic  disabling LBP problems  
[3]. 
Although there  is great  variability  in the definition  of acute and subacute  LBP, for the purposes  of this guideline,  
we will use the Institute  for Clinical Systems  Improvement  definitions  of 0 to 4 weeks to define  acute LBP,  4 to 12 
weeks for subacute LBP, and >12 weeks for chronic  LBP [5]. 
It is clear  that uncomplicated  acute  LBP and/or  radiculopathy is a benign,  self-limited  condition  that does not 
warrant  any imaging studies [4,6,7] . Imaging is considered  in those  patients who have  had up to 6 weeks of medical  
management  and physical  therapy  that resulted  in little or no improvement  in their back  pain.  It is also considered  
for those  patients  presenting  with red flags , raising  suspicion  for a serious underlying  condition,  such as cauda 
equina  syndrome  (CES),  malignancy,  fracture,  or infection  (see Table 1).

settings  (adapted  from  Bigos et al  [8]). 
Red Flag  Potential  Underlying  Condition  as Cause  of LBP  
• History  of cancer  
• Unexplained  weight  loss 
• Immunosuppression 
• Urinary  infection  
• Intravenous  drug use 
• Prolonged  use of corticosteroids 
• Back  pain not improved with conservative

• Loss of anal sphincter  tone or fecal  incontinence  
• Saddle  anesthesia  
• Bilateral  or progressive  weakness in the lower  
limbs  • Cauda  equina  syndrome  or other  severe neurologic  
condition  
Previous  guidelines  have  suggested  that imaging  be performed  in adults  >50 years of age who present  with LBP. 
When  studied,  there was no statistically  significant  difference in primary  outcome  after 1 year for patients  aged  65 
years or older  who had spine  imaging  within  6 weeks after an initial  visit for care for LBP versus similar  patients  
who did not undergo early  imaging  [9]; thus,  this document  does not include  >50 years of age as an independent  
red flag. However, an important age-related risk factor for spinal fracture presenting as LBP  is osteoporosis.

Guideline: ACR low back pain.pdf, Page: 6
Page Content: As 
bone mass decreases slowly over time, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age, and differs by sex, race, 
ethnicity  [10], and comorbidities. In line with the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations for patients  
ages 65 and older being screened for osteoporosis, patients  >65 years of age may be considered at risk for 
osteoporotic fracture when presenting with LBP . 
Additionally,  for those  patients without  neurologic  compromise  and who present  with minor  risk factors for cancer,  
inflammatory  back  disease  (eg, ankylosing spondylitis), vertebral  compression  fracture,  or symptomatic  spinal  
stenosis,  imaging  should be considered  after a trial of therapy  [4]. 
In the majority  of patients, no specific pathology for LBP can be identified. Also,  studies have  shown  imaging  
abnormalities  in a substantial  number  of people  without back  pain [11-13]. The challenge for the clinician, therefore,  
is to distin guish the small  segment  within  this large patient  population that should be evaluated  further because of 
suspicion  of a more  serious  problem  or identify  pathology that requires intervention . 
Other  nonspine  causes of LBP can have overlap  in clinical  presentation,  including inflammatory  arthritis  and other  
systemic conditions , such as pelvic,  renal,  vascular,  or gastrointestinal  etiologies.  If an inflammatory  etiology  is 
suspected  as the cause of LBP, such as ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic  spondylitis, reactive arthritis, or 
inflammatory  bowel  disease– related  spine  disorders,  please see the ACR  Appropriateness Criteria® topic  on 
“Inflammatory Back Pain: Known or Suspected Axial Spondyloarthropathy ” [14].

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 16 Low Back  Pain fractures.  Additionally, the distinction  between  malignant  and benign compression  fractures  can be assessed  on 
MRI.  The visualization  of the convex  posterior  vertebral  body  border,  extension  into the posterior  elements,  and 
abnormal  marrow  signal  are suggestive  of pathologic  fracture  [58]. 
Radiography Lumbar  Spine  
In patients  with history  of osteoporosis  or steroid  use, initial evaluation  with radiography  is useful  [55]. Radiography  
with anteroposterior  and lateral  radiographs  is useful  for assessing  LBP in patients  with low suspicion  of trauma  or 
minor  trauma  and patients  suspected  of having possible vertebral  compression  fracture.  Upright  radiographs  provide  
useful  functional  information  about  axial  loading.  Flexion  and extension  views can be performed  to evaluate for 
spine  stability. Evaluation  of the extent  of vertebral  body  comminution  is limited  on radiography,  particularly  in 
patients with osteoporosis.  
Variant  7: Low  back  pain  with  or without  radiculopathy.  One or more  of the following:  suspicion of cancer,  
infection, or immunosuppression. Initial imaging.  
A systematic review examining studies that used red flags  as an indication  for screening  found  that of all the red 
flags,  only a history  of cancer  has been  shown  to increase  the probability  of finding spinal  malignancy  [61]. In a 
patient  suspected  of having cancer,  MRI without  and with IV contrast  is considered  superior  in evaluation  of 
localizing  disease (intramedullary, intradural -extramedullary,  and extradural)  as well as assessing  extent  of the 
lesion.

2. Explanation: The patient is a 17-year-old female with a 2-month history of right thigh pain, which is worse at night and improves with naproxen. The X-ray suggests the possibility of an osteoid osteoma at the right femur shaft. An MRI without and with IV contrast is usually appropriate in this case to confirm the finding of osteoid osteoma. MRI is a highly sensitive and specific imaging modality for the detection and characterization of musculoskeletal tumors, including osteoid osteoma. The use of IV contrast can help to further characterize the lesion and its vascularity, which can be useful in planning for potential treatment options.

Page Content: Patellofemoral car tilage loss is also associated with chronic knee pain , with active knee pain correlated with 
BMLs [30,31]. Similar to CT, MRI can calculate various anatomic measurements associated with patellofemoral 
subluxation/dislocation and lateral patellofemoral friction syndrome [32-34]. Bone marrow edema in the classic 
location for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also 
differentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise 
therapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. 
Other etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat 
pad impingement syndromes, Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome, adhesive 
capsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes , 
and osteonecrosis [15, 19,36-45].  
MRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a 
joint effusion. However, contrast -enhanced images ma y be more accurate in diagnosing other causes of chronic 
knee pain , such as Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome, and adhesive 
capsulitis [15].  In particular, enh ancing synovitis thicker than 2 mm in Hoffa’s fat is correlated with peripatellar 
pain [46]. Contrast -enhanced MRI is also useful in quantifying the degree of synovitis and in evaluating 
conditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis [ 17,42,47,48].

to distinguish  tenosynovial  giant  cell tumor  from  synovial  chondromatosis  and other  proliferative  synovial  
processes,  although CT might  help to detect  subtle  calcifications , which  can sometimes  be seen with synovial

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Traumatic shoulder pain is shoulder pain believed to be directly attributed to a traumatic event, either acute or 
chronic. This pain may be the result of either fracture (the clavicle, scapula, or proximal humerus) or soft -tissue 
injury (most commonly of the rotator cuff, acromioclavicular ligaments, or labroligamentous complex). The 
incidence of traumatic shoulder injuries is difficult to determine because some injury types, such as low-grade 
acromioclavicular separations or acute rotator cuff tears, are likely under -reported because patients  do not seek 
immediate medical treatment. However, as with many traumatic injuries, traumatic shoulder pain tends to 
disproportionately involve young adults and male patients [ 1,2]. 
The etiology of traumatic shoulder pain can often be made based on clinical examination, radiographs, and 
mechanism of injury. Traumatic shoulder injuries can generally be separated into in juries requiring acute surgical 
management and injuries in which conservative management can be attempted prior to considering surgical 
treatment. Unstable or significantly displaced fractures and joint instability are injuries most likely requiring acute 
surgical treatment.

Appropriately positioned  radiographs can exclude shoulder dislocation and most displaced fractures as the 
etiology for post -traumatic shoulder pain. In the setting of normal shoulder radiographs, the most common causes 
of post -traumatic shoulder pain are soft -tissue injuries such  as rotator cuff and labral tears.  
MRI Shoulder  
Noncontrast MRI is a reasonable imaging study in the setting of acute nonlocalized traumatic shoulder pain and 
noncontributory radiographs. In the acute trauma setting, noncontrast MRI may be preferred to MR arthrography , 
as acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint effusion for assessment of intra -articular 
soft-tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic

Shoulder dislocation or instability is most co mmon in the anterior direction. Younger patients are more likely to

patients are more likely to have rotator cuff tears in association with shoulder dislocation [ 55]. Coexisting 
humeral avulsion of the glenohumeral ligament and significant glenoid bone loss have been found in up to 10% of 
patients with recurrent shoulder instability [ 56], which underscores the need to assess both osseous and 
labroligamentous pathology in patients with shoulder dislocation or instability. Glenoid morphology and bone 
loss can play a significant factor in recurrent shoulder dislocations [15, 16,57], which may require bone grafting in 
order to restore stability [ 57].

There is no defined role for US  in evaluation of proximal humeral  fractures. Although fractures may sometimes 
be visible on US as areas of cortical interruption, US  is unable to reliably characterize fracture patterns. In ideal 
conditions, US is effective at identifying full-thickness rotator cuff tears that may be associated with humeral head 
fractures [17,22,44]. However, in the acute setting of humeral head fractur e, an US examination of the shoulder is 
significantly limited by decreased patient mobility and swelling.

There is no consensus on indications for surgical fixation of scapula fractures. In general, isolated scapula body 
fractures heal well without surgical fixation, although associated rib fractures or higher injury severity score are 
associated with worse clinical outcomes and may benefit from more aggressive surgical fixation [ 45]. Scapula 
fractures involving the glenoid articular surface or glenoid neck may also require surgical fixation.  
CT Shoulder  
Because of the scapula’s complex osteology and overlying ribs, scapula fractures can be easily missed or 
underappreciate on conventional radiographs.

Explanation: The patient presents with a subcutaneous lump on the right thigh that has been present for 3 months. Given the patient's concern about cancer and the family history of gastric cancer, imaging is warranted to further characterize the mass. The ordered MRI scan is usually appropriate in this scenario as it provides a detailed analysis of the morphology of the soft tissue mass and can provide further insight into its biologic activity, which informs the interpreter on diagnosis and appropriate next steps in management.

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
A variety  of benign and malignant  processes may present  clinically  as a soft tissue  mass.  The behavior  of a mass,  
whether  nonaggressive,  indeterminant,  or aggressive,  can often  be discerned  based  on history  and physical  
examination.  However,  when  a benign clinical diagnosis  cannot  be confidently provided,  further  characterization  
of a soft tissue mass  with imaging  is warranted  [1]. Urgent  imag ing requests should be sought  for masses  that are 
>5 cm in diameter,  deep  in location, or have  shown  rapid  growth [2]. Modern imaging  techniques  allow  for a 
detailed  analysis of the morphology  of a soft tissue mass  as well as further insight  into its biologic  activity , which  
informs  the interpreter  on diagnosis  and appropriate  next steps in management  [3,4].  
The purpose  of this document  is to identify  the most  appropriate  imaging  study(ies)  to order  for the assessment  of 
a soft tissue  mass  based  on the most  frequently encountered  clinical  scenarios in medical  practice.

shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist, hand, hip, femur/thigh, knee, tibia/lower leg, ankle, and foot.  
Radiography Area  of Interest  
Initial imaging  assessment  of a suspected  musculoskeletal  soft tissue mass  should almost  invariably  begin with 
radiographic  evaluation  and is advocated  by ESMO -EURACAN [9]. Radiographs  remain  the modality  best suited  
for the initial assessment  of a suspected  soft tissue mass  and are the initial study  of choice for orthopedic  oncologists  
[25,26] . However,  radiographs  have  limitations  and may not reveal  an abnormality  when  a mass is small, deep -
seated,  nonmineralized,  or in an area with complex  anatomy  such as the flank,  paraspinal  region,  groin,  or deep  soft 
tissues of the hands  and feet [11]. 
US Area  of Interest  
The diagnostic  accuracy  of US is considerably  less when  lesions outside  the subcutaneous tissue are included.  It is 
also less reliable  for defining deep  masses in large anatomical  areas [27]. Although a recent  prospective  study of 
US accuracy  in the characterization  of 134 histologically  proven  deep  soft tissue masses showed  promising results,  
there were only a small  number  of malignancies in the study cohort , and the investigators  had a high level  of US 
expertise [28].

The body  regions  covered  in this clinical  scenario  include  the neck,  chest,  abdomen,  pelvis,  humerus/upper  arm, 
shoulder, elbow,  forearm,  wrist,  hand,  hip, femur/thigh, knee,  tibia/lower  leg, ankle,  and foot. 
Radiography Area  of Interest  
Initial imaging  assessment  of a suspected  musculoskeletal  soft tissue mass  should almost  invariably  begin with 
radiographic  evaluation  and is advocated  by the European Society  for Medical  Oncology– European Reference  
Network  Clinical Practice  Guidelines  for rare adult  solid  cancers (ESMO -EURACAN)  [9]. Although often  
considered  unrewarding  by clinicians  without  musculoskeletal  expertise,  a study of the radiogra phic evaluation  of 
454 patients  with proven  soft tissue masses demonstrated  positive  results in 62% of cases,  with calcification  
identified  in 27% of cases,  bone  involvement  in 22% of cases,  and intrinsic  fat in 11% of cases [10]. Specifically,  
radiographic  findings  can be diagnostic  or highly  character istic,  such as in the identification  of phleboliths  within  a 
hemangioma,  the osteocartilaginous  masses  of synovial  chondromatosis,  or the peripherally  more  mature  
ossification  of myositis  ossificans,  to name  just a few. In addition, radiographs  can be diagnostic  of an unsuspected  
skeletal  abnormality  or deformity  that may manifest  as a soft tissue mass.

Image -Guided Fine  Needle Aspiration  Area  of Interest  
The l iterature  does not support  the use of image -guided fine needle aspiration  as the initial examination  for a soft 
tissue mass.  At least 20% to 25% of soft tissue masses can demonstrate  features that allow  for confident  diagnosis  
based  on MRI alone  [23], many  of which  are benign and thus would not warrant  fine needle aspiration.  Therefore,  
diagnost ic imaging  that includes  comprehensive  characterization  of the mass should routinely  be performed  before  
biopsy.  In fact, the National  Comprehensive  Cancer  Network  Clinical Practice  Guidelines in Oncology for Soft 
Tissue Sarcoma state that biopsy or fine needle aspiration  should be performed  only after adequate imaging  [24]. 
Variant  3: Soft tissue mass.  Nondiagnostic  radiograph  and noncontrast -enhanced  ultrasound. Next  imaging

The body regions covered in this clinical scenario include the neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, humerus/upper arm, 
shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist, hand, hip, femur/thigh, knee, tibia/lower leg, ankle, and foot.  
Of note, this variant addresses the scenario in  which radiographs and/or noncontrast US have been performed but 
did not sufficiently characterize a soft tissue mass. In addition, this variant presumes there are no contraindications 
to any imaging modality. Variant 4 specifically addresses the situation  of a contraindication to MRI.

1. Classification: USUALLY APPROPRIATE
2. Explanation: Given the patient's presentation of a lump on the foot with calcifications seen on X-ray and ultrasound, an MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate for further assessment. MRI is a powerful tool for soft tissue characterization and can help in the evaluation of the lump, possibly a soft tissue sarcoma. It can provide detailed information about the size, location, and extent of the lesion, as well as its relationship to surrounding structures. This information is crucial for planning any potential surgical intervention and for determining the need for a biopsy.

less frequently in the navicular, cuboid , and cuneiform bones.  
On US, several findings have been reported in cases of painful accessory ossicles, including patients with posterior 
ankle impingement syndrome ; however , optimal characterization of the synchondrosis is difficult on US [62] . High -
resolution US offers some advantages over other imagin g modalities because it allows dynamic exploration of the 
foot with further assessment of stability of the synchondrosis and tendon tears when present as well as direct clinical 
correlation and comparative evaluation with the asymptomatic foot [77] . Power Doppler US has proven useful in 
identifying increased blood supply in the setting of ankle impingement [78,79] .

MRI Foot  
Compression of the infe rior calcaneal nerve or Baxter’s neuropathy manifests as denervation changes of the 
abductor digiti minimi muscle. Because of  its ability to demonstrate signal intensity changes in the presence of 
muscle denervation, MRI has been sho wn to be useful in the dia gnosis of patients with Baxter’s neuropathy and in 
the exclusion of other causes of foot pain [23] . However, fatty atrophy of the abductor digiti minimi muscle is not 
a specific sign of Baxter’s neuropathy and can be found in 4% of asymptomatic subjects [80]. Contrast 
administration is not routinely performed in the initial assessment of neuropathic syndromes.

Imaging plays  a central  role in characterizing  soft-tissue and osseous infections  in the diabetic foot by identifying  
the location, evaluating  the extent  of involvement,  and detecting  complications , such as soft-tissue abscesses or 
sinus  tracts.  The infected  ulcer  may progress  to soft-tissue abscess,  sinus  tract,  infected  tendon sheath,  
osteomyelitis , or septic arthritis  [29]. If an ulcer  with a positive  probe -to-bone  test is present , the risk of 
osteomyelitis  is 12% to 66% [52-54 ]. The role of any imaging  modality  in these patients  is to confirm  the 
presence of soft-tissue or osseous infection  and determine the anatomic extent  for treatment  planning.  
US Foot  
US demonstrates limited  benefit  in the detection  of adult  osteomyelitis  because of its inability  to penetrate the 
cortex  of the bone.  The role of US in the diabetic  foot includes  detecting  subperiosteal  and soft-tissue abscesses,  
tenosynovitis,  joint effusions,  and radiolucent  foreign  bodies.  US is insensitive  to the marrow  edema  and 
trabecular  microfractures present  in neuropathic  foot. 
CT Foot  
CT is able to image  large anatomic regions  rapidly with multiplanar  capability.

Guideline: ACR chronic foot pain.pdf, Page: 4
Page Content: Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  
usually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, 
osteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite 
versus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess 
with radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton’s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other 
causes of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg’s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals 
or soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . 
Though radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in 
patients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The 
combination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a 
specificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15]. 
US Foot  
Ultrasound (US) is usually not indicate d as the first imaging  study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain, but may 
be performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of pathologic conditions of the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, 
and other conditions such as tarsal tunnel syndrome, Morton’s  neuroma , plantar plate tears,  and intermetatarsal

Radiography Foot  
Conventional radiography can be useful to distinguish among different causes of chronic foot pain and is usually 
the first imag ing study in evaluating patients with chronic foot pain.  
The value of radiographs in the diagnosis of tarsal coalitions has been extensively demonstrated. Overall 
sensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs 
in the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral 
and oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar 
coalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs 
on the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have 
been found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable 
methods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  
Radiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review

1. Classification: USUALLY APPROPRIATE
2. Explanation: The patient is a young, active individual who has experienced acute foot pain after a strenuous activity, with tenderness on deep palpation of the 2nd and 3rd metatarsals. This clinical scenario raises suspicion for a stress fracture. Given the patient's symptoms and the physical examination findings, an MRI of the mid and forefoot without IV contrast is usually appropriate. MRI is a sensitive diagnostic tool for detecting stress fractures, especially in the early stages when radiographs may be negative. It can provide detailed images of the bones and soft tissues, helping to rule out other potential causes of the patient's pain.

are negative,  MRI can be obtained in select  patients  with forefoot  pain because of its increased  sensitivity  for the 
early  detection  of metatarsal  head  subchondral  fracture  [54]. 
Lisfranc  Injury  
MRI has been  advocated  as a sensitive diagnostic  test in evaluation  of Lisfranc ligamentous  complex  (especially  
if the patient  is not able to bear weight),  and 3-D volumetric  acquisitions  have  proven superiority  over orthogonal  
proton  density  fat-suppressed  imaging [33,38,41- 45]. There is a high correlation  between  MRI and intraoperative  
findings  for an unstable  Lisfranc injury  [44]. In the patient  with a suspected  Lisfranc injury  and normal  
radiographs,  the literature  supports  further advanced  imaging  by MRI  and CT [21,33,43,46] . 
Turf Toe and Plantar  Plate Injuries 
MRI is the preferred  imaging method for evaluating  suspected  “turf  toe” and lesser  metatarsal  plantar  plate  injury  
by directly  evaluating  the soft-tissue structures of the capsuloligamentous  complex  as well as assessing  chondral  
and osteochondral  lesions [29,55,56] . 
Acute  Tendinous  Rupture  
MRI tends  to be used as a screening  tool when  one is not certain  of the specific tendon injury  or if concomitant  
osseous injury  is suspected.  Both  MRI and US have  been  shown  to be sensitive  for the diagnosis  of acute tendon  
rupture  or dislocation  in the foot [39].

injury  [30]. The combination  of a positive  drawer  test coupled with transverse deviation  of the third  MTP  joint on 
radiographs  can be used to diagnose  high-grade  plantar  plate  tear of the second  MTP joint [31]. 
A forced  dorsiflexion lateral  view of the hallux  MTP  joint is recommended  if there is clinical  suspicion  of plantar  
plate  injury  of the first MTP joint [29].

The most commonly used imaging techniques in the diagnosis of Morton’s  neuroma  are MRI and US. It has been 
shown that MRI has a significant effect in the diagnostic and therapeutic decisions made by orthopedic surgeons 
thanks to an increase in their confidence levels and change in treatment [34] . MRI is believed to be a sensitive and 
reliable method to evaluate patients with metatarsalgia and Morton’s  neuroma  with a sensitivity of 87%, specificity 
of 100%, accuracy of 89%, PPV of 100% , and NPV of 60% in surgically treated patients [35] . In a meta- analysis,  
MRI had  a pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio , and negative likelihood ratio of 93%, 68%, 1.89,  
and 0.19, respectively [36]. Increased fluid within the intermetatarsal bursa, which suggest s bursitis, is well 
demonstrated on MRI [37] . Although the use of gadolinium does not seem essential to detect Morton’s  neuroma s 
[38], it may facilitate its detection  because of  the improved soft -tissue contrast [32,39] . 
MRI is widely accepted as the imaging study  of choice for diagnosis of plantar plate tears. In a prospective study, 
Sung et al [40] found high accuracy (96%), sensitivity (95%), specificity (100%), PPV (100%), and NPV (67%) for 
MRI with surgical correlation. In this study,  moderate concordance was found between tear severity on MR I and 
surgery with greater concordance at higher severity. A meta-analysis showed higher diagnostic accuracy for MRI 
than US for the detection of plantar plate tears with sensitivity and specificity for MRI of 95% and 54%, respectively

further studies are needed, optimization of bone mass may reduce risk of sustaining str ess injuries or possibly 
reduce recovery time i n athletes with these injuries.  
It should be noted that after a diagnosis of stress fracture is made, no additional imaging is typically performed. 
Patients are typically followed clinically until they are pain  free, at which time they can  increase activity in a 
controlled manner  [53]. 
Variant 6 : Suspected stress (in sufficiency) fracture , pelvis or hip. First imaging study.  
See variant 1.  Pelvic and hip insufficiency fractures have varied presentations and often insidious onset. Patients 
frequently present with intractable lower back or pelvic pain, with loss of mobil ity and independence  and 
symptom exacerbation with weight bearing [54]. Insufficiency fractures occur in patients with abnormal bone , be 
it from osteoporosis, irradiated bone, or resumpt ion of activity postarthropl asty as typical examples. Insufficiency 
fractures also occur at fairly predictable sites, including the sacrum , supra -acetabular ilium, superior and inferior 
pubic rami,  and pubic bone . Radiographs should be the initial imaging modality in patients with low back and/or 
pelvic pain. Anterior -posterior ( AP) and lateral lumbar spine and AP pelvis radiographs are usually obtained. 
Because of  overlying bowel gas, fecal material, vascular calcifications, sacral curvature, and/or copious soft 
tissue, the sensitivity of radiographs is low  [55]. Radiographs may be more likely to be negative initially in older 
or osteoporotic patients with insuffi ciency fractures, particularly when they occur in the pelvis or sacrum  where 
there is more overlapping soft tissue [ 17]. However, if the findings are conclusive for insufficiency fracture, no 
further imaging need be performed.  
Variant 7 : Suspected stress (insufficiency) fracture, pelvis or hip.  Negative radiographs. Next imaging

Page Content: Furthermore, certain athletic activities often result in specific sites of fatigue  fracture, such as olecranon process 
fractures in javelin throwers and baseball pitchers, proximal femur and tibial stress fractures in runners, and  tarsal  
navicular stress fractures in basketball players [ 36-38] . Correlat ion of  clinical history, pattern , and site recognition 
with radiographic findings  is usually specific [1,2,4,5,7]. Nevertheless, stress fractures are frequently occult on 
initial radiographs  [1], with conventional radiographs having a sensitivity of 15% to 35% [8]. Early radiographic 
findings are often nonspecific (subtle periosteal reaction , gray cortex sign) or even nonexistent. Late radiographic 
findings are often suggestive in appearance  and include  linear sclerosis (often perpe ndicular to the major 
trabecular lines), periosteal reaction , patchy endosteal sclerosis, and soft -tissue swelling . Additionally, 
radiographs may remain negative depending on the timing of re imaging , the patient’s metabolic bone status, and 
the type and lo cation of the fracture. Thus, radiographs are specific but significantly insensitive. Despite this 
limitation, all authorities agree that radiographs should be the initial imaging modality; if the findings are 
conclusive, no further imaging need be perform ed. 
Variant 2: S uspected stress (fatigue) fracture, hip. Negative radiographs. Next imaging study.   
Short -term (10  to 14 days) follow -up radiographs are more sensitive than initial radiographs secondary to overt

or a fracture line was of prognostic value [ 51] and that MRI performed better in predicting return to activity than 
radiographs , bone scintigraphy, or CT [50,52]. 
A recent prospective study in university athletes found that MRI grading s everity, total-body bone mineral density 
evaluated by dual -energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and location of injury (ie , cortical or trabecular bone)  
were important variables for predicting time to full return to sport [ 31]. In this study, periosteal edema as 
described by Fredericson et al [ 48] was not associated with return to sport . Using the modified grading scale and a 
multiple regression model, for every 1- unit increase in MRI grade, the time to full return to sport increased by 
approximately 48 days [31] . Furthermore, trabecular st ress injuries (eg , femur neck and pubic bone ) were 
associated with a longer time to return to sport than cortical bone stress injuries. In addition, decreased bone 
mineral density leads to increased time to return to sport . Therefore, bone mineral density provides additional 
diagnostic and prognostic information [31]. The model of MRI  grade, trabecular versus cortical bone sit e, and 
total-body bone mineral density a ccounted for 68% of the variation in time to return to sport [ 31].

Page Content: Finally, stress fractures of the femoral head are high  risk in healthy patients and , if not recognized promptly, have 
increased  rates of delayed union, nonunion, displacement, and avascular necrosis [17]. Given the importance of 
recognizing these high-risk fractures in the femoral head and neck, MRI is the preferred second -line study after  
initial negative  radiographs to prevent delayed diagnosis.  
Variant 3: Suspected stress (fatigue) fracture, excluding hip  and vertebrae. Negative radiographs. Next 
imaging study.  
See variant 2. Certain stress fractures are considered high  risk based on a tendency for nonunion or delayed union. 
High -risk stress fractures include the anterior tibial diaphysis, lateral femoral neck and femoral head (see variant 
2), patella, medial malleolus, navicular, fifth metatarsal base, proximal second metatarsal, tibial hallux sesamoid, 
and talus  [43]. 
The second -line test to diagnose a stress fracture should be guided by the location of the patient ’s pain and 
likelihood of high-risk injury. A follow -up radiographic examination has increased sensitivity compared to initial 
radiographs [8] but is less sensitive than MRI. MRI is extremely sensitive and demonstrates stress abnormalities 
as early as bone scintigraphy and with as much sensitivity [ 11-14]. The recent literature favors MRI as the 
procedure of choice for making an early diagnosis of both varieties of stress fractures [ 15-28 ]. MRI is also 
considerably more specifi c than bone scintigraphy [ 19,23]. Stress injuries in athletes that are not identified and 
managed in a timel y fashion can progress to more serious fractures. Preventive strategies, including identifying 
and modifying risk factors, may help deter progression to frank fractures [31,44,45]. 
A circumstance that deserves specific attention is the longitudinal stress fracture, particularly in the tibia. Up to 
25% may appear n ormal on radiographs, but CT or MRI findings are characteristic [ 13,46].

2. Explanation: The patient presents with symptoms of foot swelling and redness, which are suggestive of a possible infection such as cellulitis or osteomyelitis. Given the patient's history of diabetes, the risk of osteomyelitis is increased. The MRI of the foot without and with IV contrast is usually appropriate in this scenario as it can help to identify soft-tissue infections, tumors, abscesses, early neuropathic arthropathy, or subtle fractures not revealed on initial radiographs. This is in line with the ACR Appropriateness Criteria for suspected osteomyelitis of the foot in patients with diabetes mellitus.

The likelihood  of developing osteomyelitis  without  an associated  wound or ulceration  is extremely  low. Almost  
all osteomyelitis  and soft-tissue abscesses of the diabetic  foot represent  areas of contiguous  infection  from  
adjacent  skin ulcerations and not hematogenous  seeding  [14]. Any imaging modality  performed  for this variant  
should be able to identify  soft-tissue infections,  tumors  and abscesses,  early  neuropathic  arthropathy,  or subtle  
fractures not revealed  on initial radiographs . Diabetic foot osteomyelitis  and neuroarthropathy  can be difficult  to 
differentiate  clinically.  The early  diagnosis  of neuropathic  disease prior  to the development  of radiographic  
change  is important, as these  patients  will be treated  with altered  footwear  and orthotics  to prevent  the progression  
to deformity.

Radiography Foot  
Radiographs  are useful  as the initial screening  examination.  They  evaluate anatomic detail  and previous  surgeries  
and are useful  to evaluate for other  causes of pain, such as radiopaque  foreign  body,  soft-tissue gas, fracture,  
degenerative changes,  neuropathic  arthropathy , or tumor.

Page Content: Variant  3: Soft-tissue swelling with ulcer. Suspected osteomyelitis of the foot in patients with diabetes  
mellitus  with or without neuropathic arthropathy. Additional imaging following radiographs. 
Imaging plays  a central  role in characterizing  soft-tissue and osseous infections  in the diabetic foot by identifying  
the location, evaluating  the extent  of involvement,  and detecting  complications , such as soft-tissue abscesses or 
sinus  tracts.  The infected  ulcer  may progress  to soft-tissue abscess,  sinus  tract,  infected  tendon sheath,  
osteomyelitis , or septic arthritis  [29]. If an ulcer  with a positive  probe -to-bone  test is present , the risk of 
osteomyelitis  is 12% to 66% [52-54 ]. The role of any imaging  modality  in these patients  is to confirm  the 
presence of soft-tissue or osseous infection  and determine the anatomic extent  for treatment  planning.  
US Foot  
US demonstrates limited  benefit  in the detection  of adult  osteomyelitis  because of its inability  to penetrate the 
cortex  of the bone.  The role of US in the diabetic  foot includes  detecting  subperiosteal  and soft-tissue abscesses,

1. Classification: USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE
2. Explanation: According to the ACR Appropriateness Criteria, the initial imaging study for suspected acute cervical spine blunt trauma in patients aged 16 years or older should be a CT scan, not an MRI. CT is the preferred modality for the initial assessment of cervical spine injury. MRI is typically used as a next imaging study after a CT scan, especially in cases where there are signs or symptoms of cervical spinal cord or nerve root injury. In this case, the patient has not had any prior imaging, making the ordered MRI scan usually not appropriate as the initial imaging study.
3. Recommendation: CT cervical spine without IV contrast should be the initial imaging study.",USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE,CT cervical spine without IV contrast,"Guideline: ACR suspected spine trauma.pdf, Page: 12
Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 12 Suspected Spine Trauma However, there are no widely accepted criteria for grading th e severity of cervical spine soft-tissue injury on MRI, 
and while MRI has been shown to have high sensitivity fo r identifying soft-tissue inju ries of the cervical spine, 
the specificity of MRI for identifying clinically signifi cant cervical soft-tissue injuries is only modest. In a 2015 
study by Zhuge et al [62], MRI demonstrated 100% sensitiv ity for diagnosis of injury to the cervical paraspinal 
muscles, intervertebral disc, and interspinous ligament but  with specificities of only 77%, 71%, and 64% for these 
structures, respectively. Therefore, care should be taken in  interpretation of soft-tissue injuries identified on MRI. 
Variant 5: Age greater than or equal to 16 years. Susp ected acute cervical spine blunt trauma. Clinical or 
imaging findings suggest arterial injury with or wi thout positive cervical spine CT. Next imaging study. 
Arterial injury can be a concern in blunt and penetrating spinal injury. An estimated 1% to 3% of blunt trauma 
patients are diagnosed with cerebrovascular injury  [63,64]. These injuries can include transection, 
pseudoaneurysm formation, and simple dissection. Di ssections and pseudoaneurysms  may or may not produce 
stenosis and flow limitation of the affected artery. The presence of dissection in itself is generally taken to 
represent a risk of thrombus forma tion and subsequent embolization. 
Many different head and neck injury patterns and c linical symptoms have been associated with blunt 
cerebrovascular injuries (BCVIs) [52,53,63-68]. Up to two-th irds of patients with BCVIs may be asymptomatic at 
presentation [65] and not develop stroke-like symptoms for 48 to 72 hours after initial blunt trauma injury [63,64]. 
Screening for BCVI is ideally performed  to appropriately initiate anticoagul ation therapy prior to the patient 
developing neurologic deficits.

Guideline: ACR suspected spine trauma.pdf, Page: 14
Page Content: Furthermore, MRI has been found to have low (64% to 77%) specificity in identifying clinically significant 
interspinous ligament, intervertebral disc, and paraspinal muscle injury [62]. 
While not limited to obtunded patients, recent prospectiv e multicenter trials suggest that MRI has a role in 
evaluating patients who have a negative cervical spine CT. The Western Trauma Association Multi-Institutional 
trial reported that CT was effective for ruling out clinically  significant injury with a sensitivity of 98.5%. A small 
but clinically significant incidence of a missed injury was noted [56]. The prospective ReCONECT trial studied 
767 patients who had a negative cervical spine CT and we nt on to MRI because of cervicalgia (43.0%), inability 
to evaluate (44.1%), or both (9.4%). MRI was abnormal in 23.6% of all patients, including ligamentous injury 
(16.6%), soft-tissue swelling (4.3%), vertebral disc injury  (1.4%), and dural hematomas (1.3%). The patients with 
abnormal MRI were less likely to have their cervical colla r removed than those with normal MRI (13.3% versus 
88.1%). Eleven patients underwent cervical spine surgery af ter the MRI results. The clin ical significance of these 
abnormal MRI findings could not be determined from this study group [55]. By inference, it is likely that some 
obtunded patients with negative cervical spine CT will have abnormal MRI, and some of these MRI-detected 
injuries may require treatment. 
MRA Neck 
There is no role for MRA in assessment of obtunded patie nts without traumatic injury identified on CT in the 
absence of clinical findings concer ning for cervical vascular injury.

Cervical spine CT is the preferred modality for the initia l assessment of cervical spine injury. However, CT is 
significantly inferior to MRI in identifying many soft-tissu e pathologies, such as spinal cord contusion, epidural 
hematoma, and nerve root avulsions, that can cause neur ologic deficits and require surgical intervention 
[40,41,43,57]. Therefore, CT should not be considered ad equate for excluding significant soft-tissue pathology in 
patients presenting with signs or symptoms of cervical spinal cord or  nerve root injury.

This is in line with the ACR Appropriateness Criteria for suspected spine trauma, which recommends MRI for patients with possible spinal cord injury, clinical concern for cord compression due to disc protrusion or hematoma, and suspected ligamentous instability. MRI is valuable for characterizing the cause of myelopathy in patients with spinal cord injury and predicting the outcome based on the severity of the injury.

It is important to acknowledge overlap of symptoms and examination findings. In the setting of spinal cord or

Criteria® topic on “ Myelopathy ” [22] or the ACR Appropriateness Criteria® topic on “ Plexopathy ” [23], 
respectively. This criterion is for patients ≥16 years of age. For children with  suspected spine trauma, see the

cervical collar in place. 
Variant 9: Age greater than or equal to 16 years. Blunt trauma meeting criteria for thoracic and lumbar 
imaging. Initial imaging. 
Imaging is a crucial component in assessment of thoracic and lumbar spine injury. Fr om 1998 to 2011, there was 
an adjusted annual increase of approximately 8% in thor acolumbar spine fractures in patients involved in motor 
vehicle collisions [15]. Thoracolumbar fractures are cha llenging to identify clinically, with only 48% to 75% of 
thoracolumbar injuries identified on clinical examination [16-18]. Unlike cervical injuries, well-defined clinical 
criteria have not been established to determine when thor acolumbar imaging is appropriate in the setting of blunt 
traumatic injury. Since clinical examination has poor sen sitivity for identifying thoracolumbar injuries, any high-
risk patient (mid line thoracolumbar tenderness, high-energ y mechanism of injury, or >60 years of age), as well as 
unexaminable patients (intoxicated, GCS <15, distracting injury), should undergo imaging of the thoracolumbar 
spine. Screening of the entire spine is advised, as an es timated 20% of spine injuries will have a second associated 
spinal injury at a noncontiguous level [26,27]. 
Radiography  Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
It is well established that CT outperforms radiographs in  the diagnosis of thoracolumbar spine fractures [104-
108]. Radiographs have a reported sens itivity of 49% to 62% for identifying thoracic spine fractures and 67% to 
82% sensitivity for identifying lumbar spine fractures [ 104,107,108] compared with the reported sensitivity of 
94% to 100% for identifying thoracolumbar spine fract ures using CT [104,107,108].

Guideline: ACR suspected spine trauma.pdf, Page: 6
Page Content: Table 3. CCR Low-Risk Factors for Cervical Spine 
Injury [5] 
 Simple rear-end motor vehicle crash 
 Patient in sitting position in emergency center 
 Patient ambulatory at any time after trauma 
 Delayed onset of neck pain 
 Absence of midline cervical spine tenderness 
Thoracic and Lumbar Spine Imaging 
Injuries to the thoracolumbar spine are even more prevalent than cervical spin e injury, with an estimated 4% to 
7% of patients presenting to the emergency department  with blunt trauma sustaining a fracture of the 
thoracolumbar spine [13,14]. An increasing rate of t horacolumbar spine fractures h as been seen in the United 
States over the past several decades, despite a decline in other motor vehicle–related injuries [15]. While the exact 
reason for this increase is uncertain, it is likely due to a combination of both increased detection of thoracolumbar 
spine injury and increased rate of seatbelt injury. Similar to cervical in juries, there is a wide spectrum of 
thoracolumbar spine injuries ranging from stable, minor soft -tissue injuries to unstable fracture dislocations that 
are often accompanied by neurologic injuries. In contrast  to the cervical spine, there are no widely used and 
validated criteria to help determine if th oracolumbar spine imaging is appropriate. 
Clinical examination has a low to very low sensitivit y for identifying thoracolumbar spine injuries [16-18]. 
Therefore, a low threshold should be maintained for screen ing the thoracolumbar spine with imaging in the setting 
of blunt trauma, particularly in older patients, who are at increased risk for spine fractures occurring in the setting 
of low-energy trauma, such as a fall from standing (ie,  fragility fractures), which are due to diminished bone 
mineralization commonly present in older patient populations . A low threshold for imaging of the thoracolumbar

CT Myelography Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
CT myelography can be performed to assess for traumatic spinal canal narrowing that is due to disc herniation or 
epidural hematoma and to assess for preganglionic nerve root avulsions. Ho wever, as with conventional CT, CT 
myelography is inferior to MRI in assessing cord contus ion, cord hemorrhage, and postganglionic nerve root 
injuries [40,41,43,57]. Performance of thoracolumbar CT myelogram can also be technically challenging, 
particularly in patients with suspected  unstable thoracolumbar spine injury. 
CT Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
CT does play a role in the initial assessment of thoracic and lumbar spine injury. However, CT is significantly 
inferior to MRI in identifying many soft-tissue pathologies,  such as cord contusion, epidural hematoma, and nerve 
root avulsions that can cause neurologic deficits re quiring surgical intervention [40,41,43,57]. Therefore, CT 
should not be considered adequate for excluding signifi cant soft-tissue pathology in patients presenting with 
thoracolumbar spine trauma and neurologic deficit. 
MRI Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
MRI should be performed in patients who have possible spinal  cord injury, in whom there is clinical concern for 
cord compression that is due to disc protrusion or hema toma, and in those suspected of ligamentous instability. 
MRI is valuable for characterizing the cause of myelopathy in  patients with spinal cord  injury. The severity of the 
injury—including extent of intramedullary hemorrhage , length of edema, and evidence of cord transection—
contributes to predicting outcome.

A comprehensive literature review of thoracolumbar trau ma was performed by Hsu et al [19] in 2003 with the 
conclusion that patients should undergo im aging of the thoracolumbar spine if  the following criteria were present: 
(1) back pain or midline tenderness, (2) local signs of thoracolumbar injury, (3) abnormal neurological signs, (4) 
cervical spine fracture, (5) Glasgow Coma  Scale score (GCS) <15, (6) major distracting injury, or (7) alcohol or 
drug intoxication. A prospective study by Holmes et al [20] of 152 patients with thoracolumbar spine injury in 2003 found 100% negative predictive value for thoracolumbar spine injury in patients not meeting any of the 
following criteria: (1) complaints of thoracolumbar spine pain, (2) thoracolumb ar spine tenderness, (3) a 
decreased level of consciousness, (4) intoxication with etha nol or drugs, (5) a neurologic deficit, or (6) a painful 
distracting injury. A prospective study of over 3,000 adult blunt trauma patients performed by Inaba et al [21] in 
2015 found 98.9% sensitivity for identifying patients with clin ically significant thoracolumbar spine injury using 
the following criteria: (1) positive physical examination (i ncluding neurologic deficit), (2) high-risk mechanism of 
injury, and (3) ≥60 years of age. It should be noted that in the study by Inaba et al, patients with altered 
consciousness (GCS <15), intoxication, or painful distrac ting injury were excluded from analysis because of their 
inability to perform an adequate examination necessitating imaging clear ance of the thoracolumbar spine. 
However, none of these 3 proposed criteria have  been validated independently (Table 4).",True

2. Explanation: The patient is presenting with acute low back pain following a cricket match, which is likely due to muscle strain or a minor injury. There are no red flags such as history of cancer, unexplained weight loss, immunosuppression, urinary infection, intravenous drug use, prolonged use of corticosteroids, or significant trauma. The patient also does not have any neurologic compromise. According to the ACR guidelines, imaging should be considered after a trial of therapy for patients without neurologic compromise and who present with minor risk factors. Furthermore, MRI lumbar spine with IV contrast is not typically performed independently as an initial study, as its interpretation is most informative when correlated with standard noncontrast sequences included in MRI lumbar spine with and without IV contrast. 
3. Recommendation: NO SCAN REQUIRED. The patient should be managed conservatively with rest, analgesics, and physiotherapy. If symptoms persist or worsen after a trial of therapy, then imaging may be considered.",USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE,NO SCAN REQUIRED,"Guideline: ACR low back pain.pdf, Page: 6

bone mass decreases slowly over time, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age, and differs by sex, race,

osteoporotic fracture when presenting with LBP . 
Additionally,  for those  patients without  neurologic  compromise  and who present  with minor  risk factors for cancer,

In the majority  of patients, no specific pathology for LBP can be identified. Also,  studies have  shown  imaging  
abnormalities  in a substantial  number  of people  without back  pain [11-13]. The challenge for the clinician, therefore,

Page Content: A prospective  cohort  study of 20 patients  showed  no significant differences in MRI changes over 12 
months  in patients  presenting  with acute LBP compared  with their asymptomatic counterparts , except  in disc 
herniation,  nerve  root compression,  and annular  fissure [15]. Even  in the setting  of disc herniation,  imaging  may 
have  limited  role in management  as the majority  of disc herniations  show  some  degree of reabsorption  or regression  
by 8 weeks after symptom onset  [16]. It is important  to note that repeat  imaging  in patients  with new episodes of 
LBP and previous  MRI scans are unlikely  to detect  differences in disc protrusion,  annular  fissures,  high-intensity  
zones,  or end-plate  signal  changes [13]. 
Despite the lack of evidence to support  imaging early  or prior  to conservative treatment  for LBP, there is significant  
variation  in the ordering practices of physicians,  with nonadherance  to guidelines  leading  to increased  health  care 
utilization  [17,18] . A retrospective cohort  study of 145,320  patients ≥66 years of age  with acute nonspecific  LBP, 
revealed  27.2%  received  radiography  and 11.1%  received  CT or MRI within  4 weeks of the initial primary  care

showed  that 336 (19.0%)  received  lumbar  MRI within  6 weeks of presentation  (nonadherent  to guidelines).  This 
nonadherent  group had an increased  likelihood  of lumbosacral  injections  or surgery  for outpatient, inpatient, and

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
In the United  States,  acute low back  pain (LBP),  with or without radiculopathy , is the leading  cause of years lived  
with disability  and the third  ranking cause of disability -adjusted  life years  [1]. It is the fifth most  common  reason  
for a physician  visit in the United  States  and accounts for approximately  3% of visits  to the emergency  department  
[2]. 
The American  College  of Physicians and the American  Pain Society  classify  LBP into the following  broad  
categories:  nonspecific LBP, back  pain potentially  associated  with radiculopathy or spinal  stenosis,  and back  pain 
potentially  associated  with another  specific spinal  cause [3].

Guideline: ACR low back pain.pdf, Page: 5
Page Content: Additionally,  guidelines  from  the American  College  
of Physicians and the American  Pain Society  [3,4]  emphasize a focused  history  and physical  examination,  
reassurance,  initial pain management  medications if necessary,  and consideration  of physical  therapies without  
routine  imaging  in patients  with nonspecific  LBP. Duration  of symptoms  also helps  guide  treatment  algorithms  in 
patients  with acute,  subacute,  or chronic  LBP. Additionally, assessment  of psychosocial  risk factors when  obtaining  
patient  history  is a strong predictor  of patients  who are predisposed  to developing chronic  disabling LBP problems  
[3]. 
Although there  is great  variability  in the definition  of acute and subacute  LBP, for the purposes  of this guideline,  
we will use the Institute  for Clinical Systems  Improvement  definitions  of 0 to 4 weeks to define  acute LBP,  4 to 12 
weeks for subacute LBP, and >12 weeks for chronic  LBP [5]. 
It is clear  that uncomplicated  acute  LBP and/or  radiculopathy is a benign,  self-limited  condition  that does not 
warrant  any imaging studies [4,6,7] . Imaging is considered  in those  patients who have  had up to 6 weeks of medical  
management  and physical  therapy  that resulted  in little or no improvement  in their back  pain.  It is also considered  
for those  patients  presenting  with red flags , raising  suspicion  for a serious underlying  condition,  such as cauda 
equina  syndrome  (CES),  malignancy,  fracture,  or infection  (see Table 1).

2. Explanation: The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of acute myelopathy, including numbness and tingling in all 4 limbs, uncoordinated movements, and difficulty controlling continence. Given her history of systemic lupus erythematosus, an inflammatory condition that can result in acute myelopathy, an MRI of the whole spine with and without IV contrast is a suitable choice. This imaging modality is recommended in the context information for evaluating the spinal cord when investigating the etiology of acute myelopathy. The use of contrast can help identify any inflammatory or infectious etiologies.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 4 Myelopathy Intramedullary  cord signal  changes on MRI in patients with spondylotic  myelopathy represent  prognostic  factors  
for neurosurgical  outcome  [21,37-41] . Intravenous  (IV) contrast  is typically  not required  for the diagnosis  of 
spondylotic  myelopathy,  but characteristic patterns of enhancement  can be seen immediately  at and below  a level  
of stenosis [42,43] . 
In patients  who have  undergone  spinal  surgery,  complications  in the early  postoperative  setting  (eg, hematoma)  can 
result  in extrinsic compression  of the spinal  cord and are best evaluated  using  MRI without  and with IV contrast  
[44]. 
In cases in which spinal  cord ischemia is suspected  as the cause for acute myelopathy,  MRI without and with IV 
contrast is useful in cases where spinal cord ischemic is suspected as the cause for acute myelopathy  [27,28,45-47] . 
Contrast  enhancement  is typically  not seen in the early  phase of acute ischemia and, if present,  may suggest  an 
alternative  inflammatory  or infectious  etiolog y [48]. Diffusion -weighted  imaging  can show  signal  alteration  in the 
spinal  cord earlier  after patient symptom  onset  compared  with T2-weighted  images  [49,50] . As such,  diffusion-
weighted  imaging  should be included anytime  there is concern  for spinal  cord ischemia [51]. 
When  considering  inflammatory  or infections  etiologies  of myelopathy,  visualization  of the osseous spinal column 
as well as the spinal  cord is useful  and best accomplished  noninvasively by MRI [4,7,45,52 -60]. 
Demyelinating  diseases such as MS and NMO can present  as acute myelopathy.

Guideline: ACR myelopathy.pdf, Page: 6
Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 6 Myelopathy patients  with relapsing -remitting  MS [12]. When myelopathy due to MS is suspected,  MRI detection  of spinal  cord 
lesion(s)  fulfills  part of the 2016  MAGNIMS  criteria  [63]. Other  demyelinating  processes such as NMO and ADEM  
can present  as chronic  myelopathy less commonly.  In patients  with chronic  or progressive myelopathy,  MRI  of the 
spinal  cord can identify  spinal  cord lesions suggestive  of demyelinating  disease in addition  to excluding  alternative  
etiologie s. Contrast -enhanced  imaging  is recommended  for initial diagnostic  evaluation  [69,70] . 
Metabolic  causes of chronic  or progressive  myelopathy result  in changes in the spinal  cord known  as subacute 
combined degeneration  and are best evaluated  with MRI [11,83,84] . Chronic  infections  can have  a similar  
appearance [12].  
Radiation -induced  myelopathy is a rare dose-dependent  complication  that anatomically  localizes to a prior  radiation  
port [85]. Autoimmune  myelitis  includes  paraneoplastic myelopathy [86,87] . MRI  without  and with IV contrast  is 
useful  to evaluate the spinal  cord in these instances.  
Vascular  malformations  can likewise present  with chronic  and slowly  progressive  myelopathy [88]. MRI without  
and with IV contrast  is useful  to demonstrate spinal  cord edema  caused  by venous  hypertension and enlarged  veins  
along the dorsal  surface of the spinal  cord.  There may be patchy  intramedullary  enhancement  due to breakdown  of 
the blood-cord  barrier.  In some  cases,  abnormal  vasculature may be identified  that may be useful  to guide  spinal  
arteriography  and intervention [5,89-91] .

spinal  stenosis,  recurrent  disc herniation)  can result  in extrinsic  compression  of the spinal  cord and are best evaluated  
using MRI without  and with IV contrast  [44]. 
Demyelinating  diseases such as MS can present  as subacute/chronic myelopathy.  MS is the classic  demyelinating  
disease and is characterized  by lesions affecting  the spinal  cord (and brain)  and clinical  defects disseminated  in 
space and time [61]. Spinal cord involvement  is seen in 80% to 90% of patients  with MS, most  commonly affecting  
the cervical  cord [62]. Patients  with primary  progressive  MS tend to have  more  spinal  cord involvement  than

CES is rare and results from  dysfunction of the sacral  and lumbar  nerve  roots  within  the vertebral  canal  secondary  
to cauda equina  nerve  root compression , producing impairment  of the bladder,  bowel,  or sexual  function and 
perianal  or saddle numbness.  Back  pain with or without  radicular  symptoms,  weakness in the lower  limbs, sensory  
changes or numbness  in the lower  limbs,  or absent  lower  limb reflexes are other  symptoms  that have  been  described  
[38]. A review of physical  examination  findings  reported  by Fairbanks  et al [39] found LBP as the most  common  
physical  finding in patients  with the diagnosis  of CES.  The most  common  cause of CES is lumbar  disc herniation  
at the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels.  Other  etiologies  include  neoplasm,  infection/inflammation, spinal  stenosis,  and 
hemorrhage.  
Multifocal deficits  and progressive neurologic  deficits can be caused  by a number  of other  noncompressive  
etiologies  with some  overlapping clinical  features.  Please see the ACR Appropriateness Criteria® topic on 
“Myelopathy ” for guidance  [40]. 
The imaging  study of choice in the evaluation  of suspected  CES, multifocal deficit, or progres sive neurologic  deficit  
is MRI because of its  ability to accurately  depict  soft-tissue pathology,  assess  vertebral  marrow,  and assess the

Although infrequent,  spinal  cord ischemia can result  in acute onset  myelopathy and in adults  is most  commonly  the 
result  of atheromatous  disease  or as a complication  of aortic  surgery  [3]. Other  pathologies  that may predispose  
patients  to developing spinal  cord ischemia include  systemic hypotension,  thoracoabdominal  aneurysms or 
dissection , sickle cell disease,  and spinal  arteriovenous  malformations  (AVM s) [27,28] . Very  rarely,  patients  may 
develop hematomyelia and subsequently acute myelopathy because of an intrameduallary  AVM  or spinal  artery  
aneurysm  rupture  [29,30] . Acute ischemic myelopathy can also develop in the setting  of fibrocartilaginous  embolic  
disease [31]. Depending on the level(s)  of the spinal  cord involved,  patients  will typically  develop acute paraparesis 
or quadriparesis.  Inflammatory  conditions  that can result  in acute myelopathy include  demyelinating  diseases such 
as multiple  sclerosis (MS),  neuromyelitis  optica  (NMO),  and acute disseminated  encephalomyelitis (ADEM) ; 
systemic inflammatory  conditions  such as systemic lupus  erythematous,  Sjogren  syndrome,  mixed  connective  tissue

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
In the United  States,  acute low back  pain (LBP),  with or without radiculopathy , is the leading  cause of years lived  
with disability  and the third  ranking cause of disability -adjusted  life years  [1]. It is the fifth most  common  reason  
for a physician  visit in the United  States  and accounts for approximately  3% of visits  to the emergency  department  
[2]. 
The American  College  of Physicians and the American  Pain Society  classify  LBP into the following  broad  
categories:  nonspecific LBP, back  pain potentially  associated  with radiculopathy or spinal  stenosis,  and back  pain 
potentially  associated  with another  specific spinal  cause [3].

Guideline: ACR low back pain.pdf, Page: 6
Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 6 Low Back  Pain Table  1. Red Flags : Indications  of a more  complicated  status  include  back  pain/radiculopathy  in the following  
settings  (adapted  from  Bigos et al  [8]). 
Red Flag  Potential  Underlying  Condition  as Cause  of LBP  
• History  of cancer  
• Unexplained  weight  loss 
• Immunosuppression 
• Urinary  infection  
• Intravenous  drug use 
• Prolonged  use of corticosteroids 
• Back  pain not improved with conservative  
management  • Cancer  or infection  
• History  of significant  trauma  
• Minor  fall or heavy  lift in a potentially  osteoporotic  
or elderly  individual  
• Prolonged  use of steroids  • Spinal fracture  
• Acute  onset  of urinary  retention  or overflow  
incontinence  
• Loss of anal sphincter  tone or fecal  incontinence  
• Saddle  anesthesia  
• Bilateral  or progressive  weakness in the lower  
limbs  • Cauda  equina  syndrome  or other  severe neurologic  
condition  
Previous  guidelines  have  suggested  that imaging  be performed  in adults  >50 years of age who present  with LBP. 
When  studied,  there was no statistically  significant  difference in primary  outcome  after 1 year for patients  aged  65 
years or older  who had spine  imaging  within  6 weeks after an initial  visit for care for LBP versus similar  patients  
who did not undergo early  imaging  [9]; thus,  this document  does not include  >50 years of age as an independent  
red flag. However, an important age-related risk factor for spinal fracture presenting as LBP  is osteoporosis.

Guideline: ACR low back pain.pdf, Page: 6
Page Content: As 
bone mass decreases slowly over time, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age, and differs by sex, race, 
ethnicity  [10], and comorbidities. In line with the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations for patients  
ages 65 and older being screened for osteoporosis, patients  >65 years of age may be considered at risk for 
osteoporotic fracture when presenting with LBP . 
Additionally,  for those  patients without  neurologic  compromise  and who present  with minor  risk factors for cancer,  
inflammatory  back  disease  (eg, ankylosing spondylitis), vertebral  compression  fracture,  or symptomatic  spinal  
stenosis,  imaging  should be considered  after a trial of therapy  [4]. 
In the majority  of patients, no specific pathology for LBP can be identified. Also,  studies have  shown  imaging  
abnormalities  in a substantial  number  of people  without back  pain [11-13]. The challenge for the clinician, therefore,  
is to distin guish the small  segment  within  this large patient  population that should be evaluated  further because of 
suspicion  of a more  serious  problem  or identify  pathology that requires intervention . 
Other  nonspine  causes of LBP can have overlap  in clinical  presentation,  including inflammatory  arthritis  and other  
systemic conditions , such as pelvic,  renal,  vascular,  or gastrointestinal  etiologies.  If an inflammatory  etiology  is 
suspected  as the cause of LBP, such as ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic  spondylitis, reactive arthritis, or 
inflammatory  bowel  disease– related  spine  disorders,  please see the ACR  Appropriateness Criteria® topic  on 
“Inflammatory Back Pain: Known or Suspected Axial Spondyloarthropathy ” [14].

Guideline: ACR low back pain.pdf, Page: 5
Page Content: Additionally,  guidelines  from  the American  College  
of Physicians and the American  Pain Society  [3,4]  emphasize a focused  history  and physical  examination,  
reassurance,  initial pain management  medications if necessary,  and consideration  of physical  therapies without  
routine  imaging  in patients  with nonspecific  LBP. Duration  of symptoms  also helps  guide  treatment  algorithms  in 
patients  with acute,  subacute,  or chronic  LBP. Additionally, assessment  of psychosocial  risk factors when  obtaining  
patient  history  is a strong predictor  of patients  who are predisposed  to developing chronic  disabling LBP problems  
[3]. 
Although there  is great  variability  in the definition  of acute and subacute  LBP, for the purposes  of this guideline,  
we will use the Institute  for Clinical Systems  Improvement  definitions  of 0 to 4 weeks to define  acute LBP,  4 to 12 
weeks for subacute LBP, and >12 weeks for chronic  LBP [5]. 
It is clear  that uncomplicated  acute  LBP and/or  radiculopathy is a benign,  self-limited  condition  that does not 
warrant  any imaging studies [4,6,7] . Imaging is considered  in those  patients who have  had up to 6 weeks of medical  
management  and physical  therapy  that resulted  in little or no improvement  in their back  pain.  It is also considered  
for those  patients  presenting  with red flags , raising  suspicion  for a serious underlying  condition,  such as cauda 
equina  syndrome  (CES),  malignancy,  fracture,  or infection  (see Table 1).

According to the provided context, in the absence of red flag symptoms, imaging may not be required at the time of initial presentation, especially as spondylotic changes are commonly identified on radiographs and MRI in patients >30 years of age and correlate poorly with the presence of neck pain. Furthermore, MRI is more sensitive than CT in identifying degenerative cervical disorders, but the presence of degenerative changes should be interpreted with caution as they often correlate poorly with the presence of neck pain.

changes are commonly identified on radiographs and MRI in patients >30 years of age  and correlate poorly with 
the presence of neck pain [20-23]. Although the diagnostic accuracy of red flag symptoms is not validated for the 
cervical spine, the Bone  and Joint  Decade 2000 -2010 Task Force on Neck Pain and Its Associated Disorders [1] 
recommended the adoption of a similar system for cervical and neck pain, with red flags including trauma, 
malignancy, prior neck surgery, spinal cord injury, systemic diseases —including ankylosing spondylitis, diffuse 
idiopathic skeletal hyperostos is, inflammatory arthritis —suspected infection, history of intravenous drug use, 
intractable pain despite therapy , or tenderness to palpation over a vertebral body. Additional proposed red flags 
include congenital findings, concomitant vascular disease in patients >50 years of age, abnormal labs (erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate, C -reactive protein level, white blood cell), and neurological deficits [10].  
CT Cervical Spine  
CT offers superior depiction of cortical bone and is more sensitive than radiographs in assessing facet 
degenerative disease, osteophyte formation, vacuum phenomenon, and joint capsular calcification [24]. Ultra -low-
dose techniques are proposed for CT in other regions of the body [25 ]; however, currently this has not been 
directly compared to radiographs for evaluation of the neck and cervical spine.  
CT Myelography Cervical Spine  
In the absence of radiographic abnormalities or neurological symptoms, myelography is not an appropriate first -
line imaging test.

with chronic neck pain without or with radiculopathy and OPLL diagnosed on radiographs. The panel did not 
agree on recommending CT myelography cervical spine or MRI cervical spine without IV contrast in this 
clinical setting. There is insufficient medical literature to conclude whether or not these patients would benefit 
from these procedures. The use of CT myelography cervical spine or MRI cervical spine without IV contrast 
in this patient population is controversial but may be appropr iate.

Page Content: Cervical  radiculopathy is less prevalent  than cervical  or neck  pain, with one  
population-based  study showing an average annual  age-adjusted  incidence of 83.2 per 100,000 people  [31].  
Radiculopathies  may result  from  compressive causes  related to narrowing of the neural foramina, such as by facet 
or uncovertebral joint hypertrophy, or from associated dis c bulging or herniation  and degenerative spondylosis  in 
the absence of a history  of diabetes or red flag symptom s [31].  A recent meta-analysis assessing the positive 
predictive value of physical examination tests in the setting of a clinical history of cervical radiculopathy 
concluded there was limited evidence for a correlation between physical examination findings and MRI evidence 
of cervical nerve root compression [32].  This may be due to a high rate of both false -positive and false-negative 
findings on MRI in the setting of suspected cervical radiculopathy [33 ]. Most cases of acute cervical neck pain 
with radicular symptoms resolve spontaneously or with conse rvative treatment measures [31, 34]. 
In absence of red flag symptoms, imaging may not be required at time of initial presentation [1 ] as spondylotic

MRA Neck  
The literature search did not identify a ny studies regarding the use of MRA in the evaluation of this clinical 
presentation.  
MRI Cervical Spine  
In patients with neck pain without neurologic symptoms, the relevance of specific MRI findings in the cervical 
spine should be considered in light of ex pected changes associated with aging. MRI is more sensitive than  CT in 
identifying degenerative  cervical  disorders  [111, 112]. However, the presence of degenerative changes should be 
interpreted with caution. In a small series, Fryer et al [113 ] found little correlation between the presence of facet 
arthropathy and the side or level of symptoms in patients with acute, unilateral neck pain.  Spondylotic changes on 
radiographs and MRI are comm on in patients over 30 years of age and have been shown to correlate poorly with 
the presence of neck pain [20-23, 114,115]. Okada et al [112],  in a 10-year  longitudinal  MRI study,  showed  that 
cervical  disc degeneration  progressed  in 85% of patients,  though symptoms  developed in only 34% of patients.  
Most  significantly, patients  developing symptoms  showed  more  frequent  progression  of disc degeneration  on 
MRI,  including anterior  compression  of the dura and spin al cord, posterior disc protrusion, disc space narrowing,  
and foraminal  stenosis.  
Bone Scan Whole Body with SPECT or SPECT/CT Neck  
The role of Tc-99m  bone  scan in the setting  of chronic  neck  pain is limited, though SPECT likely  offers  benefit  
over conventional  planar  imaging.  Some  authors  have  advocated  the use of SPECT imaging  in identifying  the 
pain source (ie, facet  disease)  [
106].

confident early diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment guidance in these patients  [27,28]. Additionally, 
inflammatory tenosynovitis may be more conspicuous after IV  contrast administration [29]. As is the case for any

spin-echo or 3-D grad ient-recalled pulse sequences [36]. There is some evidence suggesting that MRI performed 
with a 3.0 T system is even more accurate than MRI performed with a 1.5 T system for TFCC lesions [37], but 
there are no studies comparing the accuracy of the two field s trengths in the same patients. The sensitivity for 
tears of the ulnar attachment of the disc and the peripheral attachments (the ulnocarpal ligaments) are only fair 
with noncontrast -enhanced wrist MRI [ 12,36].

percutaneous aspiration of the wrist is indicated, even when radiographs appear normal. Aspirates should be 
analyzed by cell count, gram stain, and appropriate cultures. Microscopic crystal analysis should also be obtained

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 10 Chronic Wrist Pain  importantly, though, the finding of enhancing bone marrow “edema” (osteitis) on MRI studies in patients with 
early RA is proving to be the best single predictor of future disease progression and functional dete rioration, even 
compared to serologies and clinical measures [27, 28,32-34].  
US Wrist  
The diagnosis of a specific inflammatory arthritis is typically established based on clinical and laboratory 
analysis. Advanced imaging is usually performed to determine disease activity, guide management decisions, and prognosticate outcomes. In patients with RA, US  of the wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints can  show 
inflammation  as active synovitis. Identifying active synovitis with power Doppler assessment is a useful adjunct 
in making an early diagnosis of RA when a pati ent with early arthritis does not meet the 2010 criteria established 
by the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism [20]. The presence of 
synovitis predicts progression of erosions [31 ] and erosions themselves [35]. US can also depict small bone 
erosions with high spatial resolution; h owever, US is less sensitive to erosions that occur on the radial or ulnar 
sides of the inner carpal bones because direct scanning of these regions is blocked, unlike the dorsal and volar 
bone surfaces. Furthermore, unlike MRI, US cannot show changes within the bone marrow, which are  the 
strongest prognosticator s for disease progression in RA [27, 28,32-34].  In patients with established inflammatory 
arthritis who are undergoing therapy, judging progression or reduction of synovitis may be more difficult with 
sequential US compared to sequential MRI.

2. Explanation: The patient is a 48-year-old male with a query of osteonecrosis of the navicular bone in the right foot. The ordered scan is an MRI of the right foot without and with IV contrast. According to the provided context, MRI is the most sensitive and specific imaging modality for the diagnosis of osteonecrosis, with a sensitivity and specificity nearing 100%. However, the use of IV contrast is not always necessary and there is limited evidence to support the use of MRI with IV contrast as the next imaging study for clinically suspected osteonecrosis following radiographs. Therefore, the ordered scan may be appropriate, but the use of IV contrast may not be necessary.

There is limited  evidence to support  the use of CT without  and with IV contrast  as the next imaging  study for 
clinically  suspected  osteonecrosis following  radiographs.   
CT Area  of Interest  Without IV Contrast  
CT is less sensitive  than bone  scintigraphy  and MRI  for the detection  of early  osteonecrosis [36]. Once an 
insufficiency  fracture  occurs,  CT is superior  to MRI in showing  location  and extent  of articular  collapse [37,38] . 
CT also shows osseous details  of secondary  osteoarthritis  well. 
MRI Area  of Interest  Without  and With  IV Contrast  
MRI with dynamic  contrast  enhancement  has been  shown  to be useful  to differentiate  osteonecrosis from  transient  
bone  marrow  edema  syndrome  and subchondral  insufficiency  fracture  [39]. Transient  bone  marrow  edema show s 
subchondral  spot of marked  hyperperfusion (plasma flow) , whereas osteonecrosis  shows a rim of high plasma flow 
surrounding a subchondral  area without  flow [40]. This rim is thought  to represent  granulation  tissue.  Higher  slope  
of enhancement  and maximum enhancement  in epiphysis  was seen in transient  bone  marrow  edema than in 
subchondral  fracture.  Osteonecrosis showed  overall  decreased  maximal  enhancement  [41]. 
MRI Area  of Interest  Without  IV Contrast  
MRI is the most  sensitive and specific imaging  modality  for the diagnosis  of osteonecrosis,  with a sensitivity  and 
specificity  nearing 100%  [24,28,42] .

2. Explanation: The patient's profile indicates a suspicion of pathological vertebral compression fracture. According to the ACR Appropriateness Criteria, MRI of the spine without and with IV contrast is usually appropriate for the evaluation of vertebral compression fractures, especially when there is a concern for malignancy. This imaging modality can help in determining the acuity of a vertebral fracture, demonstrating spinal canal compromise, and distinguishing between malignant and benign compression fractures. 
3. Recommendation: NO CHANGE REQUIRED",USUALLY APPROPRIATE,MRI spine without and with IV contrast,"Guideline: ACR low back pain.pdf, Page: 15
Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 15 Low Back  Pain MRI lumbar  spine  without  IV contrast  is useful  in determining  the acuity  of a vertebral  fracture,  as evidenced  by 
bone  marrow  edema and in demonstrating spinal  canal  compromise,  for example from  displaced  or retropulsed  
fractures.  For imaging  evaluation  and management  of vertebral  compression  fractures,  please see the ACR 
Appropriateness Criteria® topic on “ Management of Vertebral  Compression  Fractures ” for guidance [57]. 
Additionally,  the distinction  between  malignant  and benign  compression  fractures  can be assessed  on MRI.  The 
visualization  of the convex posterior  vertebral  body  border,  extension into the posterior  elements,  and abnormal  
marrow  signal  are suggestive  of pathologic  fracture  [58]. 
CT myelography of the lumbar  spine  assess the patency  of the spinal  canal/thecal  sac and of the subarticular  recesses

Bone  scan with SPECT/CT is usually  not used for initial imaging  but can be useful  for radiographically occult  
fractures and can be used to evaluate acuity  of vertebral  fracture . [59]. 
Whole -body FDG-PET/CT is typically  not an initial imaging study,  but as a follow -up study , it can help distinguish  
between  benign and pathologic  compression  fractures  when  other  imaging modalities  are indeterminate  [60].

Page Content: MRI Lumbar Spine Without and With IV Contrast  
MRI lumbar  spine  without  and with IV contrast  is useful  for this group.  For malignant/metastatic  disease,  MRI is 
preferred  as both bony/marrow  involvement  and neural  compression  from  epidural  tumor  are visualized  with high 
spatial  resolution  [62]. In a patient  with suspected  spinal  infection, MRI without  and with IV contrast  is preferred  
because of its  high sensitivity  and specificity. MRI can localize  the site of infection  and assess the extent  of 
extradural/epidural  and paravertebral  involvement  [65,67] , and is helpful  to distinguish  abscess from  phlegmon 
[67]. 
MRI Lumbar Spine Without IV Contrast  
MRI lumbar  spine  without  IV can be a sufficient  imaging  study  if there is low risk of epidural  and/or  intraspinal  
disease.  It is highly  sensitive for bone  marrow  abnormalities , and with a combination of noncontrast  T1-weighted  
and short tau inversion recovery sequences it can distinguish whether  they are benign or malignant  [62]. 
Radiography Lumbar  Spine  
Sensitivity  of radiography is markedly  limited  for metastases [64]. MRI is preferred  to radiography because of its  
higher  sensitivity  and specificity  for osseous lesions and for its ability  to assess soft-tissue abnormalities  [69,70] .

Radiography Shoulder  
Most  literature  suggests that radiographs  should be the initial imaging  study  in patients  with shoulder  pain [1,10] . 
Standard  radiographic  exam ination  consists of a combination  of different  projections  typically  including  
anteroposterior  (AP) internal  rotation,  AP external  rotation,  Grashey  (oblique  AP in the plane  of the glenohumeral  
joint), scapular  “Y,” and axillary  views [10]. Radiographs  can evaluate for unexpected  fracture,  unsuspected  
aggressive bony lesion,  osteoarthritis, inflammatory  arthropathy,  osteonecrosis,  or calcium  hydroxyapatite  
deposition.  Accurate  interpretation  of radiographs  can often  obviate  additional  imaging  or be complementary  to 
subsequent  imaging studie s. A high-riding  humeral  head  on radiographs  is highly associated  with chronic  rotator  
cuff tear [11], particularly  if seen in combination with sclerosis of the inferior acromion,  greater  tuberosity  cysts,  a 
lateral  acromial  spur, and cortical  irregularity  or sclerosis of the greater  tuberosity  [12-14]. 
US Shoulder  
The literature  suggests that radiographic  evaluation  should  generally  be the first imaging  study  ordered  in patients  
with shoulder  pain [1,10-14] .

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 11 Shoulder Pain –Traumatic  Variant 5: Traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs show Bankart  or Hill-Sachs lesion. Next imaging  study. 
Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions are common findings associated with transient shoulder dislocation. Bankart 
lesions have a particularly high association with transient shoulder dislocations [50], and a transient shoulder 
dislocation should be presumed if a Bankart lesion is present. A close association exists bet ween Bankart and 
Hill-Sachs lesions [ 51], and one should be sought out whenever the other is identified on radiographs. Both 
Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions can present as nonosseous  lesions that are occult on r adiographs and noncontrast 
CT. 
MRI Shoulder  
Similar to MR arthrography, noncontrast MRI is comparable to CT in evaluating glenoid and humeral head bone 
loss [12,18]. In general, noncontrast MRI performs well in diagnosing labroligamentous injuries [ 20,52]. 
However, noncontrast MRI is considered inferior to MR arthrography for assessing labroligamentous pathology 
frequently associated with Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions [ 17,19]. Noncontrast MRI is a good alternative to MR 
arthrography in the setting of acute injury when significant glenohumeral joint effusion is present to assist in 
visualization of intra -articular soft -tissue pathology.  
MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography is the preferred study for evaluating subacute or chronic Bankart lesions because of  its soft -
tissue contrast. Multiple studies have shown MR arthrography to be reliable in diagnosing labroligamentous 
injuries [12,17,52] and superior to noncontrast MRI for this indication [ 17,19].

CT is considered inferior to MRI for diagnosing essentially all soft -tissue shoulder  injuries. 
CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
CT arthrogram , althou gh not the initial study of choice, has the advantage of characterizing both bony lesions and 
significant soft -tissue injuries. CT arthrograms have been shown to be comparable to magnetic resonance ( MR) 
arthrography in diagnosing Bankart, Hill -Sachs, super ior labral anterior -to-posterior ( SLAP), and full-thickness 
rotator cuff tears, but inferior to MR arthrography for diagnosing partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [ 12], 
including bursal -sided tears. CT arthrography has also only demonstrated modest agreement between observers in 
diagnosing anterior capsular laxity of the shoulder [ 13]. 
MRI Shoulder  
Noncontrast MR imaging ( MRI) has been shown to be effective in assessing bony morphology and bone loss in 
patients with tr aumatic shoulder injuries [ 14-18 ], and noncontrast MRI is effective in diagnosing most traumatic 
soft-tissue pathologies including labral, rotator cuff, and glenohumeral ligament injuries [ 17,19,20]. 
MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography is considered the gold standard for imaging traumatic shoulder pain [4,17,19,21]. MR 
arthrography is comparable to noncontrast MRI in assessment of extra -articular soft tissues, and MR arthrography 
has been shown to be superior to noncontrast MRI i n diagnosing intra -articular pathology like SLAP tears, 
labroligamentous injuries, and partial rotator cuff tears [17,19]. MR arthrography is comparable to CT in 
evaluating traumatic osseous lesions,  such as bony Bankart  and Hill -Sachs lesions [ 12,18].

Guideline: ACR shoulder pain traumatic.pdf, Page: 12
Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 12 Shoulder Pain –Traumatic  MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography is the preferred exam ination  for the evaluation of subacute shoulder dislocations or recurrent 
shoulder instability. MRI has been shown to have similar performance to CT in the evaluation of Hill-Sachs 
lesions and glenoid bone loss [12,18]. MR arthrography has also been found to be reliable in diagnosi ng anterior 
shoulder instability and labroligamentous injuries [58,59]. MR arthrography has specifically o utperformed 
noncontrast MRI in assessment of glenohumeral ligament and anterior labral injuries [ 17,19], which ar e 
commonly seen in shoulder instability. MR arthrogr aphy has also outperformed noncontrast MRI in diagnosis of 
rotator cuff tears [17,19], which is a common associated finding in older patients with shoulder dislocation. 
However, high sensitivities reported for MR arthrography in the detection of labral pathology may not be 
applicable to patients with clinically unstable shoulders. A retrospective review of 90 patients with clinically 
unstable shoulders selected for arthroscopy [ 60] found that MR arthrography had a sensitivity of 65% for 
detection of labral  tears. The authors proposed that this discrepancy with prior studies was the result of different 
patient selection criteria (clinically unstable in their study versus less-specific symptoms such as shoulder pain in 
others) and the interpretation of MR art hrography by experienced musculoskeletal radiologists [ 60]. For this 
document, it is assumed the procedure is performed and interpreted by an expert.  
MRI Shoulder  
MRI without contrast may be pre ferred to MR arthrography in the setting of acute shoulder dislocation when a 
post-traumatic joint effusion is present to provide sufficient visualization of soft -tissue structures.

Variant 6: Traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs normal.  Physical examination and history consistent

Shoulder dislocation or instability is most co mmon in the anterior direction. Younger patients are more likely to 
have labroligamentous injury and persistent instability after dislocation compared with older patients [54]. Older 
patients are more likely to have rotator cuff tears in association with shoulder dislocation [ 55]. Coexisting 
humeral avulsion of the glenohumeral ligament and significant glenoid bone loss have been found in up to 10% of 
patients with recurrent shoulder instability [ 56], which underscores the need to assess both osseous and 
labroligamentous pathology in patients with shoulder dislocation or instability. Glenoid morphology and bone 
loss can play a significant factor in recurrent shoulder dislocations [15, 16,57], which may require bone grafting in 
order to restore stability [ 57].

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 13 Shoulder Pain –Traumatic  studies [60]. For example, patient groups were identified at the time of arthroscopy, which selected patients with 
proven labral lesions as the study population instead of evaluating all patients with clinically unstable shoulders. 
Compared to noncontrast  MRI, MR arthrography  has been shown to have increased sensitivity for detection of 
anterior labral and SLAP tears [19]. In addition, MR arthrography has been shown to detect unsuspected labral 
pathology in patients referred for imaging with low or no clinical suspicion of labral pathology [66]. 
MRI Shoulder  
MRI without contrast may be preferred to MR arthrography in the setting of acute shoulder dislocation w hen a 
post-traumatic joint effusion is typically present to provide sufficient visualization of soft -tissue structures. In the 
subacute or chronic setting, the glenohumeral joint effusion is usually too small to provide adequate joint 
distention to adequat ely assess soft-tissue structures. Non contrast MRI has been shown to be inferior to MR 
arthrography in diagnosing labroligamentous and rotator cuff injuries [ 17,19]. 
CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
CT arthrography provides comparable sensitivity and possibly improved specificity in detection of labral lesions 
compared to MR arthrography  [12,67] and can provide improved visualization of the bones in cases of complex 
trauma. However, interobserver variability in reporting of labral lesions is low [13]. CT arthrography has also 
been shown to be inferior to MR arthrography in assessing partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [12], which makes 
CT arthrography less desirable in patients where rotator cuff tears may be suspected. However, CT arthrography 
may be considered in a patient with shoulder dislocation/instabili ty and contraindication to MRI.

comparable [38]. 
The accuracy of MRI for extrinsic ligament assessment is unknown [ 37]. 
Extensor carpi ulnaris tendinopathy, tenosynovitis, and tendon rupture can be evaluated with MRI or US [43]. 
However, dynamic instability may be missed on MRI, unless sequences are performed in pronation and 
supination [44]. 
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
At 1.5T, MR arthrography has greater sensitivity compared with conventional MRI [ 45,46]. Both MRI and MR 
arthrography have poor to moderate sensitivity for partial ligament tears [ 47,48]. When only complete tears are 
considered, MRI and MR arthrography may be equivalent [ 33]. 
The accuracy of  MR arthrography for extrinsic ligament assessment is unknown [ 37]. 
US Wrist  
High -frequency US is useful for visualizing wrist tendons as well as intrinsic and extrinsic carpal ligaments 
[44,49,50]. Dynamic “clenched fist” maneuvers may be performed to improve detection of low -grade injuries 
[51]. 
For tears of the dorsal band of the scapholunate ligament, US  sensitivity varies from 46 % to 100% and specificity 
from 92 % to 100% [50-52 ]. For the dorsal band of the lunotriquetral ligament, US  sensitivity ranges from 25 % to 
50% and specificity from 90% to 100% [52,53]. US visualization of lunotriquetral ligament (particularly the 
structurally important volar band) is limited [ 49]. 
US can show dynamic subluxation of the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon during forced supination [ 44]. 
Bone Scan Wrist  
Bone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.

Guideline: ACR acute hand and wrist trauma.pdf, Page: 9
Page Content: US Area of Interest  
US is superior to radiography for detection of radiolucent foreign bodies and is recommended as the first choice 
when the foreign body is located within the superficial soft  tissues with no bone around it [ 78,79,83]. 
US allows for  better  localization of radiopaque foreig n bodies, assessment of tendons and vascular structures, and 
US-guided removal of the foreign body [77].

Bone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  
Summary of R ecommendations 
• Variant 1: Radiographs area of interest is usually appropriate for the initial imaging of adults with acute 
blunt or penetrating trauma to the hand or wrist.  
• Variant 2: Repeat radiographs in 10– 14 days, MRI without IV contrast, or CT without  IV contrast is usually 
appropriate as the next imaging study for adults with acute hand or wrist trauma when initial radiographs are 
negative or equivocal. These procedures are equivalent alternatives.  
• Variant 3: MR arthrography of wrist, MRI of wrist wit hout IV contrast, CT arthrography of wrist, or US  of 
wrist  is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for adults with suspected wrist tendon or ligament 
trauma and when radiographs show acute wrist fracture. These procedures are equivalent alternativ es. 
• Variant 4: CT of both wrists without IV contrast, MRI of wrist without IV contrast, or MR arthrography of 
wrist is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for adults when initial radiographs shows distal 
radioulnar joint or carpal malalignment in  the absence of fracture. These procedures are equivalent 
alternatives.  
• Variant 5: MRI of hand without IV contrast or US of hand is usually appropriate as the next imaging study 
for adults with suspect hand tendon or ligament trauma and when radiographs show acute hand fracture. 
These procedures are equivalent alternatives.

Page Content: Bone Scan  Wrist  
Bone scans are frequently positive for occult fractures by the time of clinical presentation , typically  1 to 2 weeks 
before radiographs. A normal bone scan can reliably exclude an occult  scaphoid fracture [51] because,  like CT 
and MRI, bone scan s have a high sensitivity; however, the specificity for bone scan is lower than CT and MRI 
[52,53] because entities such as bone contusions, osteoarthritis , and other osteoblastic processes will show 
increased up take. Scintigraphy may be a reasonable alternative to MRI in claustrophobic patients with suspected

Variant 4: Initial radiographs showing distal radioulnar joint or carpal malalignment in the absence of 
fracture. Next imaging study.  
CT Wrist  
CT is the modality of choice for evaluating distal  radioulnar joint stability [54]. The CT protocol should include 
imaging of both wrists in maximal pronation, neutral position, and maximal supination.  
CT examin ation with coronal, sagittal, and 3 -D reformed images help demonstrate the extent of injury and help in 
treatment planning, particularly in cases of chronic perilunate dislocation [ 55]. 
CT Arthrography  Wrist  
Distal radioulnar joint instability and traumatic triangular f ibrocartilage injuries can be evaluated with CT 
arthrography [56,57]. 
MRI Wrist  
Distal radioulnar joint instability and traumatic triangular fibrocartilage injuries are usually associated with fluid 
in the distal radioulnar joint , which aids in the evaluation of the triangular fibrocartilage components on 
conventional MRI.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
MR arthrograph y increases the diagnostic accuracy for proximal lamina (foveal) triangular fibrocartilage tears 
[56,57]. 
US Wrist  
US is not indicated in this clinical setting. 
Bone Scan Wrist  
Bone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  
Variant 5: Acute hand fracture on radiographs. Suspect hand tendon or ligament trauma. Next imaging 
study. 
CT Hand  
CT has limited u se for the diagnosis of soft -tissue injuries of the hand.

MRI is ideal for evaluating tendon injuries and helping with surgical planning [58, 59]. MRI is comm only used for 
the diagnosis of  Stener lesions of the thumb [60] and the diagnosis of pulley system injuries [61]. 
Hergan et al [62] reported a 100% sensitivity and specificity for assessment of thumb ulnar collateral ligament 
tears. Spaeth et al [ 63] reported a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 94% for detection of displaced ulnar 
collateral ligament tears in 16 cadaveric specimens.  
US Hand  
A Stener lesion occurs when the aponeurosis of the adductor pollicis muscle becomes interposed between the 
ruptured ulnar collateral ligament of the thumb and its site  of insertion at the base of the proximal phalanx. This 
lesion can be identified by absence of ulnar collateral ligament and the presence of a hypoechoic mass proximal to 
the apex of the metacarpal tubercle [64]. Dynamic examination shows the relationship of the aponeurosis to the 
retracted ligament stump [65] . 
US allows for diagnosis of pulley system injuries [ 66,67]. 
Bone Scan Hand 
Bone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  
Variant 6: Initial radiographs showing metaca rpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, or distal 
interphalangeal joint malalignment in the absence of fracture. Next imaging study.  
CT Hand  
CT has limited use for the diagnosis of soft -tissue injuries of the fingers.  
MRI Hand  
MRI is ideal for evaluating tendon injuries and helping with surgical planning [58]. MRI may be used to assess 
capsule and collateral ligament injuries of the proximal interphalangeal  and metacarpophalangeal joints [68].

US Foot  
US is not routinely  used as the first imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the foot in the setting  of 
peripheral  neuropathy or polytrauma.  Both  radiographs  and US are useful  imaging  tools  to exclude  a foreign  body  
in the setting  of penetrating  trauma  to the foot [24]. US is the imaging  modality  of choice if the foreign  body is 
not radiopaque  (eg, wood  or plastic) , with a reported  90% sensitivity  for visualizing  wooden  foreign  bodies  in 
some  clinical  and experimental  studies [27,28] . US can identify  a foreign  body  and also help localize  it and 
determine if it involves  a tendon  or a muscle and to evaluate for an abscess.

Radiography Foot  
Conventional radiography can be useful to distinguish among different causes of chronic foot pain and is usually 
the first imag ing study in evaluating patients with chronic foot pain.  
The value of radiographs in the diagnosis of tarsal coalitions has been extensively demonstrated. Overall 
sensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs 
in the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral 
and oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar 
coalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs 
on the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have 
been found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable 
methods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  
Radiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review 
by Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for 
radiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.",True
