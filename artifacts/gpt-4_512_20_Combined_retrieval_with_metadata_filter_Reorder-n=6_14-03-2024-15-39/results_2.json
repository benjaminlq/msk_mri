The downside of this option is that it \nresults in delay of diagnosis , which may lead to functional impairment . \nCT Area of Interest  \nWhen the initial radiographs are equivocal, CT  without IV contrast  is commonly used to exclude or confirm \nsuspected wrist fractures [18].

Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of \nlife following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays \nin diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -\nand long-term mortality [6-13].

Fractures from high -force trauma are also commonly treated with surgical \nfixation for stability to reduce the risk of post -traumatic osteo arthritis. \nDiscussion of Procedures by Variant  \nVariant 1:  Acute hip pain.

Risk \nfactors for radiographically occult fracture in these studies included those age >65, low -force trauma,  such as a \nground-level fall , and female gender.

Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type \nresult in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men \n[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs \nwill continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of \nlife following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays \nin diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -\nand long-term mortality [6-13]. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of hip fractures is critical. Hip fractures \ncannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded on the basis of physical exam ination  alone ; therefore , imaging plays a \nkey role in early  and accurate diagnosis [14] .", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "ACR acute hip pain suspected fracture.pdf", "mode": "tabular", "condition": "acute hip pain suspected fracture"}, "score": 0.7533027814403414}], "appropriateness": "USUALLY APPROPRIATE", "recommendation": "MRI pelvis and affected hip without IV contrast"}, {"question": "Patient Profile: 50 year old Chinese male.

The most  common  acute knee  injuries  result  from  \na direct  blow,  a fall, or a twisting  injury  [2,3] . The fracture  risk increases  with age, likely  secondary  to decreased  \nbone  mineral  density,  increased  frequency  of blunt  injury, and inability  to protect  the knee  during a fall [3]. An \nestimated  6.6 million  knee  injuries  presented  to emergency  departments in the United  States  from  1999 through  \n2008,  for a rate of 2.29 knee  injuries  per 1,000 population .", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "ACR acute trauma to knee.pdf", "mode": "tabular", "condition": "acute trauma to knee"}, "score": 0.6903137292642889}, {"page_content": "ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 12 Acute  Trauma  to the Knee  Variant  7: Adult  or child 5 years of age or older .

Initial imaging.  \nArteriography  Lower Extremity  \nVascular  injury  may be found in about  30% of patients  following  posterior  knee  dislocation  [56]. Injuries  of the \npopliteal artery  require  prompt  surgical  intervention to help limb preservation . Associated  peroneal  and tibial nerve  \ninjuries  may cause significant  morbidity and require  an understanding of their pathophysiologic  implications  to \nmaximize  limb functionality  [57]. Angiography  has been  the reference standard  in the evaluation  of vascular  injuries  \nassociated  with knee  dislocations  [58]. However,  this is an invasive  procedure  with associated  risk, and with the \nexcellent  performance of CTA and MRA, it is usually  performed  in selected  cases  [58]. \nCT Knee  \nCT is not routinely  used as the initial imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the knee.

Chronic ankle  pain can be caused by a variety \nof osseous or soft -tissue abnormalities, either alone or in combination. For assessing chronic ankle pain, there are \nmultiple imaging options, including radiography, stress radiography,  computed tomography (CT)  radionuclide \nbone scanning, ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and various injection procedures. Injection \nproce dures include arthrography, CT arthrography, MR arthrography, and diagnostic injection with anesthetic \nagents. Although there are numerous causes for chronic ankle pain, common etiologies include osteoarthritis, \nosteochondral injury, tendon abnormalities, ligament abnormalities and instability, and impingement.  \nOverview of Imaging Modalities  \nRadiography Radiographs can provide information about the osseous and soft -tissue structures about the ankle. Routine \nradiographs of the ankle typically include anteroposterior, lateral, and mortise views, the latter obtained by internally rotating the foot 15 to 20 degrees.", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "ACR chronic ankle pain.pdf", "mode": "tabular", "condition": "chronic ankle pain"}, "score": 0.7467280353817259}, {"page_content": "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 6 Chronic Ankle Pain  osteochondral abnormalities  [14-16], although one study found statistically significant lower sensitivity for these \nabnormalities on MR I as compared to arthroscopy [ 17].

Chronic ankle  pain can be caused by a variety \nof osseous or soft -tissue abnormalities, either alone or in combination. For assessing chronic ankle pain, there are \nmultiple imaging options, including radiography, stress radiography,  computed tomography (CT)  radionuclide \nbone scanning, ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and various injection procedures. Injection \nproce dures include arthrography, CT arthrography, MR arthrography, and diagnostic injection with anesthetic \nagents. Although there are numerous causes for chronic ankle pain, common etiologies include osteoarthritis, \nosteochondral injury, tendon abnormalities, ligament abnormalities and instability, and impingement.  \nOverview of Imaging Modalities  \nRadiography Radiographs can provide information about the osseous and soft -tissue structures about the ankle.

The choice of imaging modality depends on the patient\u2019s \npresentation and the clinical questions being asked. There are scenarios in which no imaging beyond baseline \nradiographs is necessary, but in other situations advanced imaging has added value for diagnostic eva luation and \ntreatment planning.  \nOverview of Imaging Modalities  \nRadiographs  \nImaging evaluation of the painful wrist should begin with radiog raphs [1,2]. This simple study may establish a \nspecific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, \nimpaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -\nanterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or \nmore oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling \n[3]. A v ariety of stress positions and maneuvers can be performed to elicit dynamic instability that is not visible \non standard radiographs [ 4]. Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. \nAdditionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ].", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "ACR chronic hand and wrist pain.pdf", "mode": "tabular", "condition": "chronic hand and wrist pain"}, "score": 0.6895109666139926}, {"page_content": "Furthermore, conventional \narthrography is unable to show extra -articular findings (like ganglion cysts and tendon disorders) that can cause \nradial -sided pain, further limiting its usefulness in  this patient population . \nBone Scan  Wrist  \nBone scan is not routinely used to further evaluate radial -sided chronic wrist pain when radiographs are normal or \nnonspecific.", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "ACR chronic hand and wrist pain.pdf", "mode": "tabular", "condition": "chronic hand and wrist pain"}, "score": 0.6979877721904268}, {"page_content": "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 10 Chronic Wrist Pain  importantly, though, the finding of enhancing bone marrow \u201cedema\u201d (osteitis) on MRI studies in patients with \nearly RA is proving to be the best single predictor of future disease progression and functional dete rioration, even \ncompared to serologies and clinical measures [27, 28,32-34].  \nUS Wrist  \nThe diagnosis of a specific inflammatory arthritis is typically established based on clinical and laboratory \nanalysis. Advanced imaging is usually performed to determine disease activity, guide management decisions, and prognosticate outcomes. In patients with RA, US  of the wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints can  show \ninflammation  as active synovitis. Identifying active synovitis with power Doppler assessment is a useful adjunct \nin making an early diagnosis of RA when a pati ent with early arthritis does not meet the 2010 criteria established \nby the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism [20]. The presence of \nsynovitis predicts progression of erosions [31 ] and erosions themselves [35]. US can also depict small bone \nerosions with high spatial resolution; h owever, US is less sensitive to erosions that occur on the radial or ulnar \nsides of the inner carpal bones because direct scanning of these regions is blocked, unlike the dorsal and volar \nbone surfaces. Furthermore, unlike MRI, US cannot show changes within the bone marrow, which are  the \nstrongest prognosticator s for disease progression in RA [27, 28,32-34].

The choice of imaging modality depends on the patient\u2019s \npresentation and the clinical questions being asked. There are scenarios in which no imaging beyond baseline \nradiographs is necessary, but in other situations advanced imaging has added value for diagnostic eva luation and \ntreatment planning.  \nOverview of Imaging Modalities  \nRadiographs  \nImaging evaluation of the painful wrist should begin with radiog raphs [1,2]. This simple study may establish a \nspecific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, \nimpaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -\nanterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or \nmore oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling \n[3]. A v ariety of stress positions and maneuvers can be performed to elicit dynamic instability that is not visible \non standard radiographs [ 4]. Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. \nAdditionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ].", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "ACR chronic hand and wrist pain.pdf", "mode": "tabular", "condition": "chronic hand and wrist pain"}, "score": 0.7414848287484976}, {"page_content": "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 11 Chronic Wrist Pain  CT Wrist  \nWhile CT with IV contrast enhancement can depict abscesses, it is usually not appropriate  for evaluation of \nsuspected wrist infections.  \nCT Arthrography  Wrist  \nCT arthrography is not routinely used to eval uate suspected wrist infection.  \nUS Wrist  \nThere may be a role for US in the staging of infections (for example, to delineate the location and e xtent of soft -\ntissue abscesses) after aspiration has been performed.

This simple study may establish a \nspecific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, \nimpaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -\nanterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or \nmore oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling \n[3]. A v ariety of stress positions and maneuvers can be performed to elicit dynamic instability that is not visible \non standard radiographs [ 4]. Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. \nAdditionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ].", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "ACR chronic hand and wrist pain.pdf", "mode": "tabular", "condition": "chronic hand and wrist pain"}, "score": 0.729458142549235}, {"page_content": "With or without prior injury.

Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type \nresult in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men \n[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs \nwill continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of \nlife following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays \nin diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -\nand long-term mortality [6-13].

Although \nligamentous  balance/imbalance plays  a role in joint instability, it is not the only factor  accounting for stability  [118] . \n3-Phase  Bone  Scan  Knee  \nThere is insufficient  evidence to support  routine  use of Tc-99m  3-phase bone  scans for the assessment  of instability.  \nBone  scintigraphy may be helpful  in diagnosing loosening,  especially  when  obtained many  years after surgery  [62]. \nThis delay  in maximum utility  is because of  the observation that positive  bone  scans are noted in 20% of \nasymptomatic knees 1 year after surge ry and in 12.5%  of individuals  2 years after surgery [61] . Serial  bone  scans \nmay be more  helpful  than a single  examination  [119] . Generally,  increased  uptake  on the delayed  images  but not \non the blood- pool phase is thought  to be due to loosening rather  than to infection  [60]. Normal  scans are most  \nhelpful  and are characterized  by a high NPV,  indicating  that loosening or infection  is unlikely.

This pain may be the result of either fracture (the clavicle, scapula, or proximal humerus) or soft -tissue \ninjury (most commonly of the rotator cuff, acromioclavicular ligaments, or labroligamentous complex). The \nincidence of traumatic shoulder injuries is difficult to determine because some injury types, such as low-grade \nacromioclavicular separations or acute rotator cuff tears, are likely under -reported because patients  do not seek \nimmediate medical treatment. However, as with many traumatic injuries, traumatic shoulder pain tends to \ndisproportionately involve young adults and male patients [ 1,2]. \nThe etiology of traumatic shoulder pain can often be made based on clinical examination, radiographs, and \nmechanism of injury. Traumatic shoulder injuries can generally be separated into in juries requiring acute surgical \nmanagement and injuries in which conservative management can be attempted prior to considering surgical \ntreatment. Unstable or significantly displaced fractures and joint instability are injuries most likely requiring acute \nsurgical treatment.", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "ACR shoulder pain traumatic.pdf", "mode": "tabular", "condition": "shoulder pain traumatic"}, "score": 0.7447136339651385}], "appropriateness": "USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE", "recommendation": "Radiographs of the shoulder"}, {"question": "Patient Profile: 45 year old Indian male.

This pain may be the result of either fracture (the clavicle, scapula, or proximal humerus) or soft -tissue \ninjury (most commonly of the rotator cuff, acromioclavicular ligaments, or labroligamentous complex). The \nincidence of traumatic shoulder injuries is difficult to determine because some injury types, such as low-grade \nacromioclavicular separations or acute rotator cuff tears, are likely under -reported because patients  do not seek \nimmediate medical treatment. However, as with many traumatic injuries, traumatic shoulder pain tends to \ndisproportionately involve young adults and male patients [ 1,2]. \nThe etiology of traumatic shoulder pain can often be made based on clinical examination, radiographs, and \nmechanism of injury. Traumatic shoulder injuries can generally be separated into in juries requiring acute surgical \nmanagement and injuries in which conservative management can be attempted prior to considering surgical \ntreatment. Unstable or significantly displaced fractures and joint instability are injuries most likely requiring acute \nsurgical treatment.", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "ACR shoulder pain traumatic.pdf", "mode": "tabular", "condition": "shoulder pain traumatic"}, "score": 0.73266025488937}, {"page_content": "Most soft -tissue injuries (such as labral tears and rotator cuff tears) can undergo a period of \nconservative management prior to considering surgery.

Cervical spine injuries can range from stable minor soft-tissue injuries to \nunstable complex injury patterns resulting in complete disr uption of the cervical spine with possible neurologic or \nvascular injury. The wide spectrum of injury patterns can make the decision process for when to perform imaging \nand what type of imaging to perform challenging. Over utilization of MRI and CT imaging of the cervical spine \ncan result in an extended emergency center visit while aw aiting imaging as well as iatrogenic injuries related to \nprolonged cervical collar placement [3], exposure to in travenous (IV) contrast, and exposure to radiation and \nhigh-power magnetic fields. On the other hand, failure to  identify an unstable cervical spine or cervical vascular \ninjury can result in poor clinical outcomes.", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "ACR suspected spine trauma.pdf", "mode": "tabular", "condition": "suspected spine trauma"}, "score": 0.754690333471825}, {"page_content": "Table 3.

Fr om 1998 to 2011, there was \nan adjusted annual increase of approximately 8% in thor acolumbar spine fractures in patients involved in motor \nvehicle collisions [15]. Thoracolumbar fractures are cha llenging to identify clinically, with only 48% to 75% of \nthoracolumbar injuries identified on clinical examination [16-18]. Unlike cervical injuries, well-defined clinical \ncriteria have not been established to determine when thor acolumbar imaging is appropriate in the setting of blunt \ntraumatic injury. Since clinical examination has poor sen sitivity for identifying thoracolumbar injuries, any high-\nrisk patient (mid line thoracolumbar tenderness, high-energ y mechanism of injury, or >60 years of age), as well as \nunexaminable patients (intoxicated, GCS <15, distracting injury), should undergo imaging of the thoracolumbar \nspine. Screening of the entire spine is advised, as an es timated 20% of spine injuries will have a second associated \nspinal injury at a noncontiguous level [26,27]. \nRadiography  Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nIt is well established that CT outperforms radiographs in  the diagnosis of thoracolumbar spine fractures [104-\n108]. Radiographs have a reported sens itivity of 49% to 62% for identifying thoracic spine fractures and 67% to \n82% sensitivity for identifying lumbar spine fractures [ 104,107,108] compared with the reported sensitivity of \n94% to 100% for identifying thoracolumbar spine fract ures using CT [104,107,108].", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "ACR suspected spine trauma.pdf", "mode": "tabular", "condition": "suspected spine trauma"}, "score": 0.7374915289190003}, {"page_content": "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 18 Suspected Spine Trauma Variant 10: Age greater than or equal to 16 years.

A recent meta-analysis assessing the positive \npredictive value of physical examination tests in the setting of a clinical history of cervical radiculopathy \nconcluded there was limited evidence for a correlation between physical examination findings and MRI evidence \nof cervical nerve root compression [32].
