Chronic ankle  pain can be caused by a variety \nof osseous or soft -tissue abnormalities, either alone or in combination. For assessing chronic ankle pain, there are \nmultiple imaging options, including radiography, stress radiography,  computed tomography (CT)  radionuclide \nbone scanning, ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and various injection procedures. Injection \nproce dures include arthrography, CT arthrography, MR arthrography, and diagnostic injection with anesthetic \nagents. Although there are numerous causes for chronic ankle pain, common etiologies include osteoarthritis, \nosteochondral injury, tendon abnormalities, ligament abnormalities and instability, and impingement.  \nOverview of Imaging Modalities  \nRadiography Radiographs can provide information about the osseous and soft -tissue structures about the ankle. Routine \nradiographs of the ankle typically include anteroposterior, lateral, and mortise views, the latter obtained by internally rotating the foot 15 to 20 degrees.", "metadata": {"source": "ACR chronic ankle pain.pdf", "page": "5"}}, {"page_content": "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 9 Chronic Ankle Pain  Radiography \nStress views are not routinely used for the evaluation of suspected tendon abnormality.  \nVariant 5: Chronic ankle pain.

Additionally, MRI identified the exact location of the injury in 93% of \nthe cases [15].  Comparing MRI with arthroscopy, studies have shown a range of accuracies of chronic lateral \nligament tearing (either partial or complete), ranging from 77 % to 92% for the anterior talofibular ligament and \n88% to 92% for the calcaneofibular ligament [14, 52]. For the evaluation of deep deltoid ligament tears, MRI is \nboth sensitive and specific compared with arthroscopy, with reported values of 96% and 98%, respectively [53].  \nWith regard to tears of the tibiofibular ligaments of the tibiofibular syndesmosis, MRI has a reported accuracy of 100% [54].
