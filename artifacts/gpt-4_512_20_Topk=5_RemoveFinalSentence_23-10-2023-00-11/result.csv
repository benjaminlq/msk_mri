axSpA  [66,67] ; however,  there is conflicting  evidence regarding the extent  to which  tracer  uptake  correlates with 
specific inflammatory  and structural  lesions seen on CT and MRI resulting  in uncertain ty about  its diagnostic  utility  
[64,67- 72]. In one study,  the interreader  reliability  of diagnosing  sacroiliitis  on PET/CT was poor and substantially  
lower  than that for MRI or CT [67]. In a small  study using  radiographs  as the reference standard,  F-18-fluoride

uncertain  at this time.

Page Content: MRI Spine  Area  of Interest  
Although MRI  of the sacroiliac joints  has high utility  for the diagnosis  of axSpA,  some  patients  will not demonstrate  
imaging  features of axSpA  in the sacroiliac joints  on MRI as indicated  by sensitivities  of all studies to varying 
degrees below  100%  [22], and therefore  some  patients may need  further imaging  evaluation  with MRI given that it 
is the imaging  modality  of choice for the diagnosis  of axSpA  [1,3,19,22] . Studies  have  shown  widely varying  
degrees of isolated  spinal  involvement  on MRI in axSpA  ranging from  1% to 49% [19,59-63,114,115] . Therefore,  
imag ing of the spine  is beneficial  for patients  in whom  there is suspicion  for axSpA  but imaging  of the sacroiliac 
joints  has been  negative.  Some  authors  have  shown  the utility  of using  whole -spine  or whole -body  MRI to identify  
the burden of disease rather  than selecting  specific areas of the spine  to image  because findings  may be potentially  
isolated  to any portion of the spine  [10,59,63,89,114,120-122] . 
The spine  MRI  findings  of axSpA  include  the active inflammatory  changes of spondylitis  and spondylodiscitis,  the 
inflammatory  changes of the costovertebral  joints,  costotransverse joints,  and facet  joints  and areas of enthesitis  
along other  vertebral  ligamentous  attachments [123] . The chronic  structural  changes of fatty deposition,  erosions,  
and syndesmophytes  are also characteristic findings  [123] .

lack of proven benefit  [30]. Repeat  radiographs  can be obtained as necessary  for counseling  patients  on the status  
and prognosis  of their disease,  although radiographs  are more  typically  performed  to evaluate the spine  rather  than 
the sacroiliac  joints  [30]. This is because of  the low utility  of sacroiliac joint radiographs  for detecting  disease  
progression based  on the relatively  poor intra- and interreader  reliability  of interpretation  [141] . Radiographs  can 
demonstrate evolving  structural  changes or bone  formation,  although these changes occur  slowly  over time at the 
sacroiliac joints, often  requiring  years to detect  a change and prompting many  authors  to suggest  a radiographic  
imaging  interval  of axSpA  patients  of no less than 2 years for assessment  of disease progression [141- 146]. There

US Wrist 
Several meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the 
carpal  tunnel  inlet) is highly accurate for identifying carpal  tunnel syndrome  diagnosed clinically or with the 
combination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US 
varies depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the 
measurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary 
examination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel 
syndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal 
tunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, 
clinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of 
carpal tunnel syndrome. US may be appropriate in cases where this initial evaluation is equivocal.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 9 Acute  Trauma  to the Knee  in the setting  of the acute noncontact  ACL  injury, both the presence and the severity  of lateral  bone  contusions  were  
associated  with high-grade  pivot -shift, concomitant  lateral  meniscal  lesions as well as anterolateral  ligament  
abnormality . Klengel  et al [29] found that the apparent  diffusion coefficient  maps  are more  sensitive  than 
corresponding proton density -weighted  fat-saturated  turbo spin-echo  MRI sequences for detection  of bone  marrow  
lesions after knee  trauma  and allowed  detection  of significantly  more  and larger  bone  marrow  lesions.  Additionally,  
apparent  diffusion coefficient  map evaluation  improved diagnostic  performance in regions  with insufficient  spectral  
fat saturation,  such as the patella.  Koster  et al [30] showed  that the presence of a bone  contusion  on MRI after acute  
knee  trauma  is highly  predictive  of the development  of focal  osteoarthritis  1 year after trauma . 
MRI facilitates diagnosis  of the anterolateral  ligament injuries  that have  frequent  association  with ACL  injuries  and 
anterolateral  knee  instability , of which  a minority  are associated  with Segond fractures  [31]. In a study by Kosy  et 
al [32], MRI detected  a larger  number  of anterolateral  ligament  injuries  in association  with the ACL  injuries  within  
6 weeks of the acute knee  trauma  compared  with scans performed  later, which  suggests that some  injuries  may 
resolve or become less visible  with increased  chronicity . MRI  is proven helpful  in detection  and characterization  of 
posterolateral  corner  injuries , which  can be associated  with the ACL  ruptures  and, if missed , may lead to 
considerable morbidity.

Bone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the 
subchondral bone.  New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or 
patients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee 
pain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the 
origin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. 
Subchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed 
spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to 
elderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs 
often initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, 
and progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is 
suspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria
® 
topic on “ Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae ” [28]. 
Some patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using 
quantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs 
exhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ].

Page Content: Patellofemoral car tilage loss is also associated with chronic knee pain , with active knee pain correlated with 
BMLs [30,31]. Similar to CT, MRI can calculate various anatomic measurements associated with patellofemoral 
subluxation/dislocation and lateral patellofemoral friction syndrome [32-34]. Bone marrow edema in the classic 
location for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also 
differentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise 
therapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. 
Other etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat 
pad impingement syndromes, Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome, adhesive 
capsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes , 
and osteonecrosis [15, 19,36-45].  
MRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a 
joint effusion. However, contrast -enhanced images ma y be more accurate in diagnosing other causes of chronic 
knee pain , such as Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome, and adhesive 
capsulitis [15].  In particular, enh ancing synovitis thicker than 2 mm in Hoffa’s fat is correlated with peripatellar 
pain [46]. Contrast -enhanced MRI is also useful in quantifying the degree of synovitis and in evaluating 
conditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis [ 17,42,47,48].

Radiography Foot  
Conventional radiography can be useful to distinguish among different causes of chronic foot pain and is usually 
the first imag ing study in evaluating patients with chronic foot pain.  
The value of radiographs in the diagnosis of tarsal coalitions has been extensively demonstrated. Overall 
sensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs 
in the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral 
and oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar 
coalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs 
on the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have 
been found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable 
methods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  
Radiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review 
by Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for 
radiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.

Radiography 
Radiography should be considered as the initial imaging study . Radiographs may reveal osteoarthritis, calcified or

effusions may also be identified in the anterior ankle joint recess by radiography with 53% to 74% accuracy  [19]. 
They are often associated with ligamentous injury or fracture [19]. The presence of ossific fragments can indicate 
ligamentous injury or retinaculum avulsion [20], whereas periostitis can occur adjacent to tenosynovitis. 
Radiographs can also identify synovial osteochondromatosis and erosions from chronic synovitis.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Ankle pain is considered chronic when symptoms persist > 6 weeks. Chronic ankle  pain can be caused by a variety 
of osseous or soft -tissue abnormalities, either alone or in combination. For assessing chronic ankle pain, there are 
multiple imaging options, including radiography, stress radiography,  computed tomography (CT)  radionuclide 
bone scanning, ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and various injection procedures. Injection 
proce dures include arthrography, CT arthrography, MR arthrography, and diagnostic injection with anesthetic 
agents. Although there are numerous causes for chronic ankle pain, common etiologies include osteoarthritis, 
osteochondral injury, tendon abnormalities, ligament abnormalities and instability, and impingement.  
Overview of Imaging Modalities  
Radiography Radiographs can provide information about the osseous and soft -tissue structures about the ankle. Routine 
radiographs of the ankle typically include anteroposterior, lateral, and mortise views, the latter obtained by internally rotating the foot 15 to 20 degrees.

Guideline: ACR chronic ankle pain.pdf, Page: 9
Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 9 Chronic Ankle Pain  Radiography 
Stress views are not routinely used for the evaluation of suspected tendon abnormality.  
Variant 5: Chronic ankle pain. Ankle radiographs normal or nonspecific, suspected ankle instability. Next study . 
In the absence of findings on routine radiography, imaging options to evaluate ligamentous integrity include stress radiography, MRI, MR arthrography, CT arthrography, and US.  
MRI  
One study eva luating anterior talofibular ligament injury demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy of 97% for MRI 
when compared to arthroscopic findings. Additionally, MRI identified the exact location of the injury in 93% of 
the cases [15].  Comparing MRI with arthroscopy, studies have shown a range of accuracies of chronic lateral 
ligament tearing (either partial or complete), ranging from 77 % to 92% for the anterior talofibular ligament and 
88% to 92% for the calcaneofibular ligament [14, 52]. For the evaluation of deep deltoid ligament tears, MRI is 
both sensitive and specific compared with arthroscopy, with reported values of 96% and 98%, respectively [53].  
With regard to tears of the tibiofibular ligaments of the tibiofibular syndesmosis, MRI has a reported accuracy of 100% [54]. Additionally, MRI can also demonstrate interosseous membrane tears [55]. MRI offers the advantage 
of evaluating for injuries associated with or mimicking lateral instability that may not be diagnosed on stress radiography such as tenosynovitis, tendon injury, and osteochondral lesions [56]. MRI may also be used to evaluate the ankle after lateral ligament reconstruction [57].  
MR Arthrography  
MR arthrography can be helpful for the assessment of chronic ankle instability due to lateral collateral ligament injuries [12].

2. Reference to the context information:
The patient's symptoms and X-ray findings suggest a suspicion of erosive osteoarthritis. According to the context, the next imaging study after inconclusive X-rays for chronic extremity joint pain with suspicion of erosive osteoarthritis is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that MRI can be used to improve the certainty of diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) above clinical criteria as well as to detect early joint damage before it is radiographically visible. 

3. Appropriateness of the scan order:
Based on the scoring criteria, the order for an MRI of bilateral hands with and without IV contrast to assess for erosive osteoarthritis can be considered as MAY BE APPROPRIATE. This is because, while the context does not explicitly recommend MRI for erosive osteoarthritis, it does mention the utility of MRI in detecting early joint damage and improving diagnostic certainty in cases of arthritis. Therefore, given the patient's symptoms and inconclusive X-ray findings, an MRI could potentially provide useful information. However, it's important to note that the risk-benefit ratio for the patient is equivocal, and other imaging procedures or treatments with a more favorable risk-benefit ratio may be available.",MAY BE APPROPRIATE,MRI,"Guideline: ACR chroni extremity joint pain inflammatory arthritis.pdf, Page: 4

diagnostic  performance  [21],  both outperform  clinical evaluation  and provide  prognostic  information  concerning

preferred  method for evaluation  of RA [18]. 
US has been  used to evaluate for osseous abnormalities  in the setting  of chronic  inflammatory  arthritis. Compared  
with radiography,  US has been  shown  to demonstrate a 6.5-fold  increase in the number  of detected  erosions of the 
metacarpophalangeal  joints  [12], but it is less accurate when  compared  with CT [11]. The f alse-positive  rate for US 
in detection  of metacarpophalangeal  joint erosions  has been  reported  as high as 29% [29]. Regardless,  large  erosions  
identified  with US at the second  and third  metacarpophalangeal  joints, the distal  ulna,  and the fifth 
metatarsophalangeal  joint are highly specific for and predictive  of RA [30]. US may also show  imaging  findings  
associated  with enthesitis  [25], with findings  of enthesitis  on power  Doppler  imaging  having  an accuracy  of 85.6% 
in distinguishing  peripheral  spondyloarthritis  versus nonspondyloarthropathy [31]. Studies  have  also found US to 
be helpful  in differentiating  RA and psoriatic  arthritis  [32,33] ; for example,  enthesitis  is a finding often  seen in 
spondyloarthritis  but not seen in RA. Increased  distance between  the nail and distal  phalanx in patients  with psoriatic  
arthritis  and cutaneous  psoriasis is reported  to have  an 80% sensitivity  and a 71% specificity  [34].

Guideline: ACR chroni extremity joint pain inflammatory arthritis.pdf, Page: 8
Page Content: US is also useful  in the evaluation  for synovitis  and tenosynovitis,  aided  by the detection  of hyperemia via color  or 
Doppler  signal  [23]. Power  Doppler  US is more  accurate for the diagnosis  of synovitis  and has a higher  correlation  
with disease activity  compared  with grayscale US [35,36] . Synovitis  on power  Doppler  US and grayscale US are 
both associated  with the development  of radiographic  erosions  in patients  with RA compared  with grayscale US 
[37,38] . Newer  techniques  for detecting  microvascularization  associated  with joint inflammation  like multimodal  
photoacoustic/ US and ultra-microangiography have  shown  promise  as indicators  of disease activity  [39,40] . 
US also provides  prognostic  information  (such  as detecting  synovitis)  that is linked to disease progression [13], 
although  mild synovial  hypertrophy as an isolated  finding  is not specific and has limited  relevance [41]. In the 
evaluation  of the finger  joints  with US, dorsal  evaluation  is recommended  over palmar  [42]. Abbreviated  US

   - Carpal tunnel syndrome is typically diagnosed based on clinical signs and symptoms and confirmed by the results of electrodiagnostic studies. MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in cases in which this initial evaluation is equivocal.
   - Wrist radiographs are indicated as the best initial imaging examination in patients with chronic wrist pain. When radiographs are normal or equivocal and a patient has persistent symptoms with an unclear diagnosis, MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate.

3. Based on the scoring criteria, the ordered scan (MRI right wrist without IV contrast to assess for carpal tunnel syndrome) is USUALLY APPROPRIATE. The patient's symptoms, clinical findings, and normal X-rays suggest the possibility of carpal tunnel syndrome, and the context information indicates that an MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate in such cases.",USUALLY APPROPRIATE,MRI without IV contrast,"Guideline: ACR chronic hand and wrist pain.pdf, Page: 12

Page Content: The MRI findings that have been reported in wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome —
including nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing—may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value 
in patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68]. In rare cases of secondary carpal tunnel syndrome, MRI may identify 
a mass lesion compressing the median nerve. There is some evidence that the length of T2 hyperintensity in the 
median nerve can help prognosticate the success of surgery [69] and that the shape and signal of the nerve predict 
clinical response to a steroid injection in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome [70 ]. MR neurography 
may be an option in patients with suspected carpal tunnel syndrome.  The use o f IV contrast does not contribute to 
diagnosis and is usually not appropriate.

US Wrist 
Several meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the 
carpal  tunnel  inlet) is highly accurate for identifying carpal  tunnel syndrome  diagnosed clinically or with the 
combination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US 
varies depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the 
measurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary 
examination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel 
syndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal 
tunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, 
clinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of 
carpal tunnel syndrome. US may be appropriate in cases where this initial evaluation is equivocal.  
MRI Wrist  
Historically, carpal tunnel syndrome has been diagnosed based on clinical signs and sympt oms and confirmed by 
the results of electrodiagnostic studies [67]. MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in cases in which this  
initial evaluation is equivocal.

Page Content: These factors make CT the 
preferred examination for suspected distal radioulnar joint subluxation, where images of both wrists can be  
obtained in both supination and pronation [1 ,13]. A disadvantage of CT  is its lower sensitivity to soft -tissue 
abnormalities  compared with MRI.  
High-resolution (typically multidetector) CT of the wrist following contrast injection into one or more wrist 
compartments (CT arthrography) is a powerful tool for diagnosing intra -articular abnormalities [14,15]. The 
intraobserver agreement on CT arthrogram images is extremely high and better than that reported for MRI 
[14,16]. 
US 
US of the wrist is useful for examining extra -articular soft tissues, such as suspected ganglion cyst s [17], because 
its accuracy is similar to that of MRI. US can also be used to diagnose abnormalities of the flexor and extensor 
tendons and tendon sheaths. For de Quervain disease (stenosing tenosynovitis of the abductor pollicis lon gus and 
extensor pollicis brevis tendon compartment), preoperative identification of a septum or subcompartmentalization 
within the first dorsal compartment with US  may affect surgical management [18 ,19]. 
In patients with suspected or established rheumatoid arthritis (RA), US examination of the wrist and selected 
finger joints can identify erosions and active synovit is (with the use of power Doppler), findings that influence 
early diagnosis and treatment decisions [20]. Using US to measure the size of the median nerve is a  validated  
technique in patients with clinical symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome [21-24].  
In addition, w rist US is a useful technique to guide therapeutic intr a-articular and other soft -tissue injections [25].

To evaluat e knee pain associated with other conditions, please refer to the following ACR Appropriateness 
Criteria® topic on:  “Osteonecrosi s of the Hip ” [3] for osteonecrosis,  “Acute Trauma to the Knee ” for acute knee

Special Imaging  Considerations  
Knee radiographs  should include at least one frontal projection of one or both knees (anteroposterior, Rosenberg, 
or tunnel), a tangential patellar view , and a lateral view of the affected knee [2,9]. Standing radiographs more 
accurately reflect medial and lateral compartment cartilage loss than supine radiographs with the posteromedial and posterolateral joint compartments  more accurately assessed using a weight -bearing flexion posteroanterior 
radiograph [9,10].

Bone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the 
subchondral bone.  New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or 
patients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee 
pain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the 
origin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. 
Subchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed 
spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to 
elderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs 
often initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, 
and progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is 
suspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria
® 
topic on “ Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae ” [28]. 
Some patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using 
quantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs 
exhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ].

Summary of Literature Review  
Background/Introduction 
Chronic knee pain affects tens of millions of people  in the United States annually , with the pain sometimes highly 
disabling and often negatively impacting the patient’s quality of life. Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and 
it can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain 
with the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. 
Typically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain 
persists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  
imaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated 
that approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the 
prior year) radiographs [2 ]. 
This document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  ≥5 years of age.

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  shoulder  pain lasting  >6 months  is a common  presenting  complaint , particularly  in patients  ≥40 years of 
age [1]. Along with a thorough history and physical  examination,  imaging  plays  a critical  role in determining the 
source of chronic  shoul der pain.  Common pain generators in the shoulder  include  the rotator  cuff tendons,  biceps 
tendon,  labrum,  glenohumeral  articular  cartilage,  acromioclavicular  joint, bones,  suprascapular  and axillary  nerves,  
and the joint capsule/synovium.  Imaging  can help to guide  appropriate  therapy , which  can range  from  conservative  
measures such as physical  therapy  and cortico steroid  injections  to more  invasive  procedures  such as arthroscopy or 
surgery . This document  focuses on the imaging approach  to patients  with suspected  chronic  mechanical  shoulder  
pain.

MRI can demonstrate femoral  periprosthetic  fractures  and stress reactions [18]. However,  a nondis placed  fracture  
may be difficult to see on MRI if there is only mild associated  marrow edema,  and susceptibility  artifact  from  the 
prosthesis may obscure  the pertinent  findings  [72]. Pelvic  fractures  can be demonstrated.  There is no relevant 
literature documenting t he additional benefit of MRI with IV contrast, relative to noncontrast MRI, for fracture 
detection.

[80] reviewed  the results of 3-phase bone  scans performed  on 100 patients  with a painful  hip prosthesis.  They 
reported that an abnormal scan could not differentiate aseptic loosening from infection. Although a normal result 
excluded aseptic loosening and infection, the ability of the bone scan to identify or exclude other conditions such as wear, osteolysis, and soft tissue abnormalities as the cause of the patient’s symptoms was not addressed.

- Symptoms: Severe pain in left knee after slipping and falling 3 days ago, swelling, limited range of motion due to pain
- Previous diagnosis: Post left total knee replacement 4 years ago, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, end stage renal failure on hemodialysis, cataract post intra-ocular lens
- Stage of diagnosis: Next study (after X-rays)

2. Reference information from the context:
- Periprosthetic fractures may occur either during or after surgery and can involve the femur, tibia, or patella. Supracondylar fractures occur in 0.3% to 2.5% of TKA, usually within 2 to 4 years after surgery, and often occur in the setting of low-energy trauma.
- Most patients with periprosthetic fractures are elderly, having poor bone stock.
- X-rays are the initial imaging modality but may not show all fractures, especially if they are radiographically occult.

3. Based on the scoring criteria, the scan order of an MRI of the left knee without IV contrast to assess for radiographically occult periprosthetic fracture is USUALLY APPROPRIATE. The patient's symptoms and history of a recent fall suggest a possible periprosthetic fracture, which may not be visible on X-rays. An MRI can provide more detailed images of the knee and help identify any fractures or other injuries that may be causing the patient's symptoms.",USUALLY APPROPRIATE,MRI knee without IV contrast,"Guideline: ACR imaging after total knee arthroplasty.pdf, Page: 4
Page Content: Around  10% to 30% of the 
patients  report  ongoing pain or are not satisfied  with the result  [9]. Factors,  which  contribute  to patient  
dissatisfaction , include  unmet  expectations,  functional  limitations,  and postoperative  complications  including pain 
[10]. Most  TKA  patients  expe rience improved outcomes  and long implant survival,  with long-term  TKA failure  
rates of <1% per year [5]. The growth in the number  of primary  TKA  procedures  has been  accompanied  by increased  
rates of TKA revision  procedures  [1]. Revision  procedures  for TKAs have  increased  by 5.4 procedures  per 100,000  
persons  per decade over the period from  1990  to 2002,  with a mean  revision  burden of 8.2%  [11]. Nearly  1.5 million  
of those  with primary  knee  replacement  are 50 to 69 years  of age, underscoring a large population at risk for revision  
surgery  and long-term  complications  [5]. Sharkey  et al [12] reviewed  781 revision  TKAs and found  the most  
common  failure  mechanisms  were  loosening (39.9%),  infection  (27.4%),  instability  (7.5%),  periprosthetic  fracture  
(4.7%),  and arthrofibrosis  (4.5%) . Infection  was the most  common  reason  for early  revision  (<2 years after the 
initial TKA) , and aseptic loosening was the most  common  reason  for late revision.

Guideline: ACR imaging after total knee arthroplasty.pdf, Page: 12
Page Content: Instabil ity usually  occurs because of surgical  error and/or  poor prosthesis selection  and often  
results in revision  surgery  an average of 4 years after the primary  arthroplasty  [21]. Severe instability  can result  in 
dislocation. In a 2014 review of 781 cases of prosthesis failure,  Sharkey  et al [12] found that instability  represented  
the third  most  common  cause of prosthesis failure  overall,  accounting  for 7.5%  of all cases.  The concepts of 
instability, malalignment, and loosening in TKA are closely  interrelated  [117] . When  malalignme nt of the joint is 
created  at the time of surgery,  minor  degrees of instability  can become a significant  problem.  By the same  token,  
instability, ongoing over time, can give rise to malalignment, which,  in turn, can lead to loosening.  Although 
ligamentous  balance/imbalance plays  a role in joint instability, it is not the only factor  accounting for stability  [118] . 
3-Phase  Bone  Scan  Knee  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  routine  use of Tc-99m  3-phase bone  scans for the assessment  of instability.  
Bone  scintigraphy may be helpful  in diagnosing loosening,  especially  when  obtained many  years after surgery  [62]. 
This delay  in maximum utility  is because of  the observation that positive  bone  scans are noted in 20% of 
asymptomatic knees 1 year after surge ry and in 12.5%  of individuals  2 years after surgery [61] . Serial  bone  scans 
may be more  helpful  than a single  examination  [119] . Generally,  increased  uptake  on the delayed  images  but not 
on the blood- pool phase is thought  to be due to loosening rather  than to infection  [60].

Page Content: Compared  with a review  
performed  by the same  author  in 2002 [13], polyethylene  wear  is no longer  the major  cause  of failure , and the 
percentages of revisions  for polyethylene  wear,  instability, arthrofibrosis,  malalignment,  and extensor  mechanism  
deficiency  have  all decreased.  Identifying the cause of a painful  TKA  before  surgery  is critically  important  because  
“in cases of unexplained pain,  reoperation  is unwise and frequently  associated  with suboptimal  results” [14]. 
Special Imaging  Considerations   
In some  patients with knee  arthroplasties,  repeated  hemarthroses are caused  by synovial  hyperemia  or true 
arteriovenous  malformations.  These patients can be successfully  diagnosed with angiography and treated  with 
embolization. In rare instances,  geniculate and popliteal vessel  injuries  may occur  during surgery  [15]. 
A recent  study reports  single -photon emission  CT (SPECT)/CT  arthrography with Tc-99m  sulfur  colloid  has a high 
diagnostic  accuracy  (97%)  in the evaluation  of loosening of both hip and knee  arthroplasties in patients with 
persistent  postprocedural  pain [16]. Barnsley  et al [17] also found  arthrography  with SPECT/CT to be an accurate  
means of identifying  aseptic prosthetic  joint loosening .

often  occur  in the setting  of low-energy  trauma  [136] . Tibial fractures  are associated  with loose  components  and

malalignment.  Most  patients  with periprosthetic  fractures are elderly,  having poor bone  stock.  Treatment  depends

TKA failure  [13,110-112] . Sharkey  et al [13] found  aseptic loosening to be the major  cause of late stage (>2 years)  
TKA failure.  Aseptic loosening may occur  either  because of inadequate  primary  fixation  or because of failure  after 
successful  fixation. It is thought  to result  from  mechanical  stresses,  osteolysis secondary  to particle  debris,  or poor

retrospective review of 68 patients  undergoing hip and knee  revision  surgery  indicated  that C-reactive protein  (CRP)  
was significantly  higher  in patients  with infection  compared  with those  with loosening (sensitivity  of 79% for all 
prostheses) ; however , a normal  CRP  level  did not exclude  infection  [49]. CRP  has a sensitivity  of 73% to 91% and 
a specificity  of 81% to 86% for the diagnosis  of prosthetic  knee  infection  when  a cutoff  of ≥13.5 mg/L  is used [44]. 
Although CRP  can be elevated  after surgery,  under  normal  circumstances  it generally  returns  to baseline within  2 
months  [44]. A large multicenter  study found CRP  and joint aspiration  to be the most  useful  tools  to diagnose  
infection  [50]. In an attempt  to construct  an algorithm  for evaluating  TKA infection,  Savarino  et al [51] found that 
abnormal  results  for at least 2 of 3 tests (CRP  [cutoff  0.93 mg/L],  ESR [cutoff 27 mm/h],  and fibrinogen  [cutoff  
432 mg/dL])  led to accurate results for the diagnosis  of infection  (sensitivity, 93%;  specificity,  100%;  accuracy,  
97%) . More  recently,  interle ukin-6  has also shown  promise  for diagnosing  infection , with higher  predictive  values 
than most  other  serologic  markers [52], and has shown  excellent  sensitivity  for detecting  infection  after TKA when  
combined with CRP  [53]. The American  Academy  of Orthopaedi c Surgeons  (AAOS ) guidelines  strongly  
recommend  the use of ESR, CRP , and serum  interleukin -6 testing  for patients  being assessed  for periprosthetic  joint 
infection  [54].

Page Content: Staphylococcus  aureus  and coagulase-negative  Staphylococcus  species,  including  Staphylococcus  epidermidis,  are 
the most  common organisms  associated  with these infections  [46]. Both  clinical  findings  and laboratory tests may 
serve useful  in addition  to imaging  studies.  Low-grade  or chronic  TKA  infections  may be difficult to diagnose  
preoperatively.  Duff  et al [18] noted that diagnosis  of infection  was not obvious  in 53% of knees before  revision  
arthroplasty.  Pain is the most  common  presenting  symptom  of infection, but pain is a nonspecific finding [47]. In 
acute infection,  findings  such as pain,  swelling,  warmth,  erythema,  and fever  are common,  whereas chronic  
infections  may be manifested  by pain alone  [44]. Night  pain or pain at rest is characteristic of infection, whereas  
pain on weightbearing  is more  characteristic of mechanical  loosening.  Some  authors  suggest  that infection  needs to 
be excluded  in all patients  with pain persisting  >6 months  after joint replacement  [18]. 
Laboratory findings  in the setting  of TKA infection  are often  nonspecific.  Peripheral  leukocyte  counts  are not 
elevated  in most  patients  with infected  prostheses.  Erythrocyte  sedimentation  rates (ESRs) are abnormal  in patients  
with infection, but this finding  may also be seen in uninfected  patients,  limiting  the usefulness of the test [48].

reported  that elevated  glycolytic  activity  causes  inflammatory  cells such as neutrophils  and activated  macrophages  
to be FDG avid at sites of inflammation  and infection.  Some  periprosthetic  uptake  may occur  because of marrow  
activity, and adding marrow  scanning  can increase specificity  [69]. In these instances,  the marrow  study would be

Page Content: Patellofemoral car tilage loss is also associated with chronic knee pain , with active knee pain correlated with 
BMLs [30,31]. Similar to CT, MRI can calculate various anatomic measurements associated with patellofemoral 
subluxation/dislocation and lateral patellofemoral friction syndrome [32-34]. Bone marrow edema in the classic 
location for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also 
differentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise 
therapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. 
Other etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat 
pad impingement syndromes, Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome, adhesive 
capsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes , 
and osteonecrosis [15, 19,36-45].  
MRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a 
joint effusion. However, contrast -enhanced images ma y be more accurate in diagnosing other causes of chronic 
knee pain , such as Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome, and adhesive 
capsulitis [15].  In particular, enh ancing synovitis thicker than 2 mm in Hoffa’s fat is correlated with peripatellar 
pain [46]. Contrast -enhanced MRI is also useful in quantifying the degree of synovitis and in evaluating 
conditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis [ 17,42,47,48].

- Based on the information available, the order for an MRI of the mid-forefoot without IV contrast seems to be USUALLY APPROPRIATE. The patient has a lump that is increasing in size, and while initial imaging has not shown a destructive bone lesion, the presence of calcifications and the mildly irregular margins seen on ultrasound suggest that further evaluation is needed.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 4 Chronic Foot Pain  Discussion of Procedures by Variant  
Variant 1: Chronic foot pain. Unknown etiology. Initial imaging.  
Bone Scan Foot  
There is no relevant literature  to support t he use of nuclear medicine studies as the first imaging  study  in the 
evaluation of chronic foot pain.

There is no r elevant literature  to support the use of MRI as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot

Radiography Foot  
Conventional radiography can be useful to distinguish among different causes of chronic foot pain and is usually 
the first imag ing study in evaluating patients with chronic foot pain.  
The value of radiographs in the diagnosis of tarsal coalitions has been extensively demonstrated. Overall 
sensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs 
in the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral 
and oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar 
coalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs 
on the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have 
been found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable 
methods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  
Radiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review 
by Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for 
radiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.

Page Content: Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  
usually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, 
osteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite 
versus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess 
with radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton’s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other 
causes of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg’s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals 
or soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . 
Though radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in 
patients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The 
combination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a 
specificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15]. 
US Foot  
Ultrasound (US) is usually not indicate d as the first imaging  study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain, but may 
be performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of pathologic conditions of the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, 
and other conditions such as tarsal tunnel syndrome, Morton’s  neuroma , plantar plate tears,  and intermetatarsal 
bursitis. 
Variant 2: Persistent posttraumatic foot pain. Radiographs negative or equivocal. Clinical concern includes 
complex regional pain syndrome type I. Next imaging study.  
3-Phase Bone Scan Foot  
A 3-phase bone scan may be useful in cases of suspected complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type I reflex 
sympathetic dystrophy , and several imaging findings have been described.

mellitus  with or without neuropathic arthropathy. Additional imaging following radiographs. 
Imaging plays  a central  role in characterizing  soft-tissue and osseous infections  in the diabetic foot by identifying  
the location, evaluating  the extent  of involvement,  and detecting  complications , such as soft-tissue abscesses or 
sinus  tracts.  The infected  ulcer  may progress  to soft-tissue abscess,  sinus  tract,  infected  tendon sheath,  
osteomyelitis , or septic arthritis  [29]. If an ulcer  with a positive  probe -to-bone  test is present , the risk of 
osteomyelitis  is 12% to 66% [52-54 ]. The role of any imaging  modality  in these patients  is to confirm  the 
presence of soft-tissue or osseous infection  and determine the anatomic extent  for treatment  planning.  
US Foot  
US demonstrates limited  benefit  in the detection  of adult  osteomyelitis  because of its inability  to penetrate the 
cortex  of the bone.  The role of US in the diabetic  foot includes  detecting  subperiosteal  and soft-tissue abscesses,  
tenosynovitis,  joint effusions,  and radiolucent  foreign  bodies.  US is insensitive  to the marrow  edema  and 
trabecular  microfractures present  in neuropathic  foot. 
CT Foot  
CT is able to image  large anatomic regions  rapidly with multiplanar  capability.

Radiograph y Foot  
Radiographs  are indicated  by positive  Ottawa rules with 99% sensitivity  in determining  the presence of a foot 
fracture  [1,9,10] . Radiographs  are the mainstay  of initial imaging in the setting  of acute foot trauma.  Initial  
imaging typically  consists of a 3-view study  with the possibility  of additional  views as indicated  by the clinical  
setting  [8]. Additional  views,  such as axial  calcaneal  view,  can be useful  in patients  with suspected  calcaneal  
fracture  [15] because addition of this view  increases specificity  in diagnosing calcaneal  fractures  and sensitivity  in 
distinguishing intra-articular  calcaneal  fractures.  
Lisfranc  Injury  
When  there is a fairly  high clinical  suspicion  of an acute Lisfranc injury,  the foot should be imaged.  In addition  to 
a typical  3-view  radiographic  study  of the foot (anteroposterior  [AP],  oblique,  and lateral),  an AP view with 20° 
craniocaudal  angulation can be added  [16,17] . Although patients  with Lisfra nc sprains may incur  ligamentous  
damage  without  diastasis [18], radiography  should be the initial imaging modality  in the setting  of a suspected

Because of  poor spatial  resolution,  low specificity,  and the inability  to quantify  the size of the necrotic lesion , bone  
scintigraphy is not beneficial  for characterization  of osteonecrosis.  SPECT may improve  the accuracy  of bone  
scintigraphy [30,32,33]  for detection  of osteonecrosis,  but its use has not been  widely  accepted . In addition,  few 
studies suggest  that bone  scan may be used to screen  for multifocal osteonecrosis [34,35] .

CT is less sensitive  than bone  scintigraphy  and MRI  for the detection  of early  osteonecrosis [36]. Once an 
insufficiency  fracture  occurs,  CT is superior  to MRI in showing  location  and extent  of articular  collapse [37,38] . 
CT also shows osseous details  of secondary  osteoarthritis  well. 
MRI Area  of Interest  Without  and With  IV Contrast  
MRI with dynamic  contrast  enhancement  has been  shown  to be useful  to differentiate  osteonecrosis from  transient  
bone  marrow  edema  syndrome  and subchondral  insufficiency  fracture  [39]. Transient  bone  marrow  edema show s 
subchondral  spot of marked  hyperperfusion (plasma flow) , whereas osteonecrosis  shows a rim of high plasma flow 
surrounding a subchondral  area without  flow [40]. This rim is thought  to represent  granulation  tissue.  Higher  slope  
of enhancement  and maximum enhancement  in epiphysis  was seen in transient  bone  marrow  edema than in 
subchondral  fracture.  Osteonecrosis showed  overall  decreased  maximal  enhancement  [41].

2. According to the reference information:
   - MRI lumbar spine without IV contrast is useful in determining the acuity of a vertebral fracture and in demonstrating spinal canal compromise.
   - MRI of the spine with and without IV contrast may be useful to assess for inflammation but should be carefully assessed because it is prone to artifactual distortion.
   - MRI lumbar spine with IV contrast is not typically performed independently as an initial study, as its interpretation is most informative when correlated with standard noncontrast sequences included in MRI lumbar spine with and without IV contrast.
   - When an asymptomatic VCF is identified on radiographs and there is a history of malignancy, both CT of the spine without IV contrast, or MRI of the spine either without or with and without IV contrast is recommended as the next imaging study to evaluate for bone marrow edema, enhancing tumor, or other complication.

Appropriateness Criteria® topic on “ Management of Vertebral  Compression  Fractures ” for guidance [57]. 
Additionally,  the distinction  between  malignant  and benign  compression  fractures  can be assessed  on MRI.  The 
visualization  of the convex posterior  vertebral  body  border,  extension into the posterior  elements,  and abnormal  
marrow  signal  are suggestive  of pathologic  fracture  [58].

CT lumbar  spine without  IV contrast  can be performed  to evaluate  osseous integrity  (eg, pathologic  fracture)  when  
involved with tumor.  However,  intradural  and spinal  cord pathologies  are poorly depicted  on CT, so MRI without  
and with IV contrast  is preferred . Addition of IV contrast may be useful  to assess for epidural  abscess  in patients  
for this clinical  scenario  and for patients  with suspected  infection . [45-47]. 
CT Myelography Lumbar  Spine  
CT myelography of the lumbar  spine  assesses  the patency  of the spinal  canal/thecal  sac and of the subarticular  
recesses and neural  foramen  [22]. It can be useful  in patients  with suspected  neoplasm  and neurologic  deficit.  This

An MRI of the lumbar spine without and with IV contrast is also useful for detecting bony/marrow involvement and neural compression from epidural tumor, and for localizing the site of infection and assessing the extent of extradural/epidural and paravertebral involvement.

Page Content: MRI Lumbar Spine Without and With IV Contrast  
MRI lumbar  spine  without  and with IV contrast  is useful  for this group.  For malignant/metastatic  disease,  MRI is 
preferred  as both bony/marrow  involvement  and neural  compression  from  epidural  tumor  are visualized  with high 
spatial  resolution  [62]. In a patient  with suspected  spinal  infection, MRI without  and with IV contrast  is preferred  
because of its  high sensitivity  and specificity. MRI can localize  the site of infection  and assess the extent  of 
extradural/epidural  and paravertebral  involvement  [65,67] , and is helpful  to distinguish  abscess from  phlegmon 
[67]. 
MRI Lumbar Spine Without IV Contrast  
MRI lumbar  spine  without  IV can be a sufficient  imaging  study  if there is low risk of epidural  and/or  intraspinal  
disease.  It is highly  sensitive for bone  marrow  abnormalities , and with a combination of noncontrast  T1-weighted  
and short tau inversion recovery sequences it can distinguish whether  they are benign or malignant  [62]. 
Radiography Lumbar  Spine  
Sensitivity  of radiography is markedly  limited  for metastases [64]. MRI is preferred  to radiography because of its  
higher  sensitivity  and specificity  for osseous lesions and for its ability  to assess soft-tissue abnormalities  [69,70] .

Although less sensitive and specific than MRI for evaluation  for infection  or neoplasm,  CT lumbar  spine  without  
IV contrast  can be obtained to evaluate for associated  osseous abnormalities  (eg, pathologic  fracture,  bony  
destructive change).  In some  cases,  addition  of IV contrast may be useful  to assess for epidural  abscess  in such 
patients  [45-47]. 
CT myelography of the lumbar  spine  assesses  the patency  of the spinal  canal/thecal  sac and of the subarticular  
recesses and neural  foramen  [22]. It can be useful  in patients  with suspected  neoplasm  and neurologic  deficit.  This

to be equivalent to CT in the assess ment of glenoid and humeral head bone loss [ 12,18], while being superior to 
CT in assessment of labroligamentous in juries [12]. MR arthrography is also able to delineate humeral head and 
glenoid cartilage, which can be important because some Hill -Sachs lesions affect  cartilage only  [11]. 
CT Shoulder  
Noncontrast CT has historically been used to assess Hill -Sachs and bony Bankart lesions. However, MRI has 
been shown to be equivalent to CT for a ssessing both glenoid and humeral head bone loss [ 12,18,53], and CT is 
limited in the assessment of cartilaginous Hill -Sachs lesions [11]. In addition, CT cannot assess injury to 
soft-tissue structures like the labroligamentous complex, which further limits its usefulness in evaluating Bankart 
lesions. CT should be reserved for patients with a contraindication to MRI or patients in whom MRI assessment 
of bone loss is limited.  
CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
CT arthrography has sho wn fair agreement between observers and is comparable to MR arthrography in 
diagnosing Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions [ 12,13]. However, CT arthrography is inferior to MRI in diagnosing 
other soft -tissue pathology [ 12]. CT arthrography can be considered a reasonable imaging alterna tive in patients 
with contraindication to MRI.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 11 Shoulder Pain –Traumatic  Variant 5: Traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs show Bankart  or Hill-Sachs lesion. Next imaging  study. 
Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions are common findings associated with transient shoulder dislocation. Bankart 
lesions have a particularly high association with transient shoulder dislocations [50], and a transient shoulder 
dislocation should be presumed if a Bankart lesion is present. A close association exists bet ween Bankart and 
Hill-Sachs lesions [ 51], and one should be sought out whenever the other is identified on radiographs. Both 
Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions can present as nonosseous  lesions that are occult on r adiographs and noncontrast 
CT. 
MRI Shoulder  
Similar to MR arthrography, noncontrast MRI is comparable to CT in evaluating glenoid and humeral head bone 
loss [12,18]. In general, noncontrast MRI performs well in diagnosing labroligamentous injuries [ 20,52]. 
However, noncontrast MRI is considered inferior to MR arthrography for assessing labroligamentous pathology 
frequently associated with Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions [ 17,19]. Noncontrast MRI is a good alternative to MR 
arthrography in the setting of acute injury when significant glenohumeral joint effusion is present to assist in 
visualization of intra -articular soft -tissue pathology.  
MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography is the preferred study for evaluating subacute or chronic Bankart lesions because of  its soft -
tissue contrast. Multiple studies have shown MR arthrography to be reliable in diagnosing labroligamentous 
injuries [12,17,52] and superior to noncontrast MRI for this indication [ 17,19].

CT is considered inferior to MRI for diagnosing essentially all soft -tissue shoulder  injuries. 
CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
CT arthrogram , althou gh not the initial study of choice, has the advantage of characterizing both bony lesions and 
significant soft -tissue injuries. CT arthrograms have been shown to be comparable to magnetic resonance ( MR) 
arthrography in diagnosing Bankart, Hill -Sachs, super ior labral anterior -to-posterior ( SLAP), and full-thickness 
rotator cuff tears, but inferior to MR arthrography for diagnosing partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [ 12], 
including bursal -sided tears. CT arthrography has also only demonstrated modest agreement between observers in 
diagnosing anterior capsular laxity of the shoulder [ 13]. 
MRI Shoulder  
Noncontrast MR imaging ( MRI) has been shown to be effective in assessing bony morphology and bone loss in 
patients with tr aumatic shoulder injuries [ 14-18 ], and noncontrast MRI is effective in diagnosing most traumatic 
soft-tissue pathologies including labral, rotator cuff, and glenohumeral ligament injuries [ 17,19,20]. 
MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography is considered the gold standard for imaging traumatic shoulder pain [4,17,19,21]. MR

labroligamentous injuries, and partial rotator cuff tears [17,19]. MR arthrography is comparable to CT in

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 12 Shoulder Pain –Traumatic  MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography is the preferred exam ination  for the evaluation of subacute shoulder dislocations or recurrent 
shoulder instability. MRI has been shown to have similar performance to CT in the evaluation of Hill-Sachs 
lesions and glenoid bone loss [12,18]. MR arthrography has also been found to be reliable in diagnosi ng anterior 
shoulder instability and labroligamentous injuries [58,59]. MR arthrography has specifically o utperformed 
noncontrast MRI in assessment of glenohumeral ligament and anterior labral injuries [ 17,19], which ar e 
commonly seen in shoulder instability. MR arthrogr aphy has also outperformed noncontrast MRI in diagnosis of 
rotator cuff tears [17,19], which is a common associated finding in older patients with shoulder dislocation. 
However, high sensitivities reported for MR arthrography in the detection of labral pathology may not be 
applicable to patients with clinically unstable shoulders. A retrospective review of 90 patients with clinically 
unstable shoulders selected for arthroscopy [ 60] found that MR arthrography had a sensitivity of 65% for 
detection of labral  tears. The authors proposed that this discrepancy with prior studies was the result of different 
patient selection criteria (clinically unstable in their study versus less-specific symptoms such as shoulder pain in 
others) and the interpretation of MR art hrography by experienced musculoskeletal radiologists [ 60]. For this 
document, it is assumed the procedure is performed and interpreted by an expert.  
MRI Shoulder  
MRI without contrast may be pre ferred to MR arthrography in the setting of acute shoulder dislocation when a 
post-traumatic joint effusion is present to provide sufficient visualization of soft -tissue structures.

Variant 6: Traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs normal.  Physical examination and history consistent

Shoulder dislocation or instability is most co mmon in the anterior direction. Younger patients are more likely to 
have labroligamentous injury and persistent instability after dislocation compared with older patients [54]. Older 
patients are more likely to have rotator cuff tears in association with shoulder dislocation [ 55]. Coexisting 
humeral avulsion of the glenohumeral ligament and significant glenoid bone loss have been found in up to 10% of 
patients with recurrent shoulder instability [ 56], which underscores the need to assess both osseous and 
labroligamentous pathology in patients with shoulder dislocation or instability. Glenoid morphology and bone 
loss can play a significant factor in recurrent shoulder dislocations [15, 16,57], which may require bone grafting in 
order to restore stability [ 57].

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 13 Shoulder Pain –Traumatic  studies [60]. For example, patient groups were identified at the time of arthroscopy, which selected patients with 
proven labral lesions as the study population instead of evaluating all patients with clinically unstable shoulders. 
Compared to noncontrast  MRI, MR arthrography  has been shown to have increased sensitivity for detection of 
anterior labral and SLAP tears [19]. In addition, MR arthrography has been shown to detect unsuspected labral 
pathology in patients referred for imaging with low or no clinical suspicion of labral pathology [66]. 
MRI Shoulder  
MRI without contrast may be preferred to MR arthrography in the setting of acute shoulder dislocation w hen a 
post-traumatic joint effusion is typically present to provide sufficient visualization of soft -tissue structures. In the 
subacute or chronic setting, the glenohumeral joint effusion is usually too small to provide adequate joint 
distention to adequat ely assess soft-tissue structures. Non contrast MRI has been shown to be inferior to MR 
arthrography in diagnosing labroligamentous and rotator cuff injuries [ 17,19]. 
CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
CT arthrography provides comparable sensitivity and possibly improved specificity in detection of labral lesions 
compared to MR arthrography  [12,67] and can provide improved visualization of the bones in cases of complex 
trauma. However, interobserver variability in reporting of labral lesions is low [13]. CT arthrography has also 
been shown to be inferior to MR arthrography in assessing partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [12], which makes 
CT arthrography less desirable in patients where rotator cuff tears may be suspected. However, CT arthrography 
may be considered in a patient with shoulder dislocation/instabili ty and contraindication to MRI.

comparable [38]. 
The accuracy of MRI for extrinsic ligament assessment is unknown [ 37]. 
Extensor carpi ulnaris tendinopathy, tenosynovitis, and tendon rupture can be evaluated with MRI or US [43]. 
However, dynamic instability may be missed on MRI, unless sequences are performed in pronation and 
supination [44]. 
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
At 1.5T, MR arthrography has greater sensitivity compared with conventional MRI [ 45,46]. Both MRI and MR 
arthrography have poor to moderate sensitivity for partial ligament tears [ 47,48]. When only complete tears are 
considered, MRI and MR arthrography may be equivalent [ 33]. 
The accuracy of  MR arthrography for extrinsic ligament assessment is unknown [ 37]. 
US Wrist  
High -frequency US is useful for visualizing wrist tendons as well as intrinsic and extrinsic carpal ligaments 
[44,49,50]. Dynamic “clenched fist” maneuvers may be performed to improve detection of low -grade injuries 
[51]. 
For tears of the dorsal band of the scapholunate ligament, US  sensitivity varies from 46 % to 100% and specificity 
from 92 % to 100% [50-52 ]. For the dorsal band of the lunotriquetral ligament, US  sensitivity ranges from 25 % to 
50% and specificity from 90% to 100% [52,53]. US visualization of lunotriquetral ligament (particularly the 
structurally important volar band) is limited [ 49]. 
US can show dynamic subluxation of the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon during forced supination [ 44].

CT is the modality of choice for evaluating distal  radioulnar joint stability [54]. The CT protocol should include 
imaging of both wrists in maximal pronation, neutral position, and maximal supination.  
CT examin ation with coronal, sagittal, and 3 -D reformed images help demonstrate the extent of injury and help in 
treatment planning, particularly in cases of chronic perilunate dislocation [ 55]. 
CT Arthrography  Wrist  
Distal radioulnar joint instability and traumatic triangular f ibrocartilage injuries can be evaluated with CT 
arthrography [56,57]. 
MRI Wrist  
Distal radioulnar joint instability and traumatic triangular fibrocartilage injuries are usually associated with fluid 
in the distal radioulnar joint , which aids in the evaluation of the triangular fibrocartilage components on 
conventional MRI.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
MR arthrograph y increases the diagnostic accuracy for proximal lamina (foveal) triangular fibrocartilage tears 
[56,57]. 
US Wrist  
US is not indicated in this clinical setting. 
Bone Scan Wrist  
Bone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  
Variant 5: Acute hand fracture on radiographs. Suspect hand tendon or ligament trauma. Next imaging 
study. 
CT Hand  
CT has limited u se for the diagnosis of soft -tissue injuries of the hand.

MRI is ideal for evaluating tendon injuries and helping with surgical planning [58, 59]. MRI is comm only used for 
the diagnosis of  Stener lesions of the thumb [60] and the diagnosis of pulley system injuries [61]. 
Hergan et al [62] reported a 100% sensitivity and specificity for assessment of thumb ulnar collateral ligament 
tears. Spaeth et al [ 63] reported a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 94% for detection of displaced ulnar 
collateral ligament tears in 16 cadaveric specimens.  
US Hand  
A Stener lesion occurs when the aponeurosis of the adductor pollicis muscle becomes interposed between the 
ruptured ulnar collateral ligament of the thumb and its site  of insertion at the base of the proximal phalanx. This 
lesion can be identified by absence of ulnar collateral ligament and the presence of a hypoechoic mass proximal to 
the apex of the metacarpal tubercle [64]. Dynamic examination shows the relationship of the aponeurosis to the 
retracted ligament stump [65] . 
US allows for diagnosis of pulley system injuries [ 66,67]. 
Bone Scan Hand 
Bone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  
Variant 6: Initial radiographs showing metaca rpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, or distal 
interphalangeal joint malalignment in the absence of fracture. Next imaging study.  
CT Hand  
CT has limited use for the diagnosis of soft -tissue injuries of the fingers.  
MRI Hand  
MRI is ideal for evaluating tendon injuries and helping with surgical planning [58]. MRI may be used to assess 
capsule and collateral ligament injuries of the proximal interphalangeal  and metacarpophalangeal joints [68].

MRI is not routinely  used as the first imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the foot in the setting  of 
peripheral  neuropathy,  penetrating  trauma , or polytrauma . 
US Foot  
US is not routinely  used as the first imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the foot in the setting  of 
peripheral  neuropathy or polytrauma.  Both  radiographs  and US are useful  imaging  tools  to exclude  a foreign  body  
in the setting  of penetrating  trauma  to the foot [24]. US is the imaging  modality  of choice if the foreign  body is 
not radiopaque  (eg, wood  or plastic) , with a reported  90% sensitivity  for visualizing  wooden  foreign  bodies  in 
some  clinical  and experimental  studies [27,28] . US can identify  a foreign  body  and also help localize  it and 
determine if it involves  a tendon  or a muscle and to evaluate for an abscess.  
Variant  4: Adult  or child older  than  5 years of age. Acute trauma to the foot.  Ottawa  rules can be evaluated  
without  exclusionary  criteria.  Ottawa  rules are negative.  Suspected  pathology  in an anatomic  area  not 
addressed  by Ottawa  rules (not involving  the midfoot; eg, metatarsal -phalangeal  joint,  metatarsal,  toe, 
tendon, etc). Initial imaging.  
In clinical  situations  when  Ottawa rules  are applicable and negative , imaging may still be desired  to evaluate for 
injuries  not assessed  by the Ottawa rules.  For example,  clinical scenarios of acute foot trauma  not directly  
addressed  by the Ottawa rules include  trauma  to the metatarsal  heads  and toes and acute tendon injury.

Variant 1: Chronic foot pain. Unknown etiology. Initial imaging.  
Bone Scan Foot  
There is no relevant literature  to support t he use of nuclear medicine studies as the first imaging  study  in the 
evaluation of chronic foot pain.  
CT Foot  
There is no relevant literature to support the use of CT as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot 
pain.  
MRI Foot  
There is no r elevant literature  to support the use of MRI as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot

Radiography Foot  
Conventional radiography can be useful to distinguish among different causes of chronic foot pain and is usually 
the first imag ing study in evaluating patients with chronic foot pain.  
The value of radiographs in the diagnosis of tarsal coalitions has been extensively demonstrated. Overall 
sensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs 
in the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral 
and oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar 
coalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs 
on the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have 
been found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable 
methods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  
Radiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review 
by Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for 
radiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.",TRUE
