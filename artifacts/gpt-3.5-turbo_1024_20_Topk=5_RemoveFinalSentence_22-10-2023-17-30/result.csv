Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 15 Chronic Shoulder Pain  Radiography Shoulder  Additional Views  
Glenohumeral  osteoarthritis  is typically  well visualized  on conventional  radiographic  views,  without  the need  for 
special  views.  A standard  axillary  view can demonstrate posterior  subluxation of the humeral  head  and abnormal  
glenoid morphology in patients with severe osteoarthritis  [145-147] . A measurement  of the critical shoulder  angle  
can be drawn  on routine  AP radiographs  by measuring  the angle  between  a line along the glenoid  surface and a line 
from  the inferior glenoid to the lateral  acromial  margin;  patients  with a higher  measurement  may be at high risk of 
having a full thickness rotator  cuff tear [148] . 
US Shoulder  
Although secondary  signs  of osteoarthritis  such as osteophytes,  joint effusion , and intra-articular  bodies  can be seen 
with US [142] , it is not typically  performed  for this indication.  
Variant  8: Chronic  shoulder  pain. History  of prior  rotator  cuff repair.  Suspect  rotator  cuff disorders or 
subacromial  subdeltoid bursitis. Initial radiographs  normal  or inconclusive. Next  imaging  study.  
Bone  Scan  Shoulder  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of bone  scan shoulder  in the evaluation  of chronic  shoulder  pain 
with a history  of prior  rotator  cuff repair  when  rotator  cuff disorder  or subacromial  subdeltoid bursitis  is suspected.  
CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
As in the native  shoulder,  CT arthrography can be used to evaluate for rotator  cuff tear after surgery . In patients  
with metal  in the shoulder , CT arthrography can be beneficial  in detecting  supraspinatus  tears that may be obscured  
by metal  artifact  [73]. Gadolinium  contrast  can potentially  be drawn  up into a mixture  with iodinated  contrast  at the 
time of the arthrogram  procedure,  thus allowing  for a shift from  MRI  to CT if artifact  on MRI preclude s evaluation.  
CT Shoulder  With  IV Contrast

is suspected.

US is reported  to be 98% sensitive and 94% specific for calcium  hydroxyapatite  in the rotator  cuff tendons  [71], 
although  identification  may be challenging if the area of calcium  deposition  is small . At times  US may have  
difficulty  distinguishing calcific  deposits  from  heterotopic  ossification  because both can result  in dense shadowing  
at US. US can be used if there  is concern  for concomitant  rotator  cuff tendon tear and may be a better  modality  than 
MRI in this situation  given the difficulty  of distinguishing  calcium  from  normal  tendon at MRI.

There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of bone  scan shoulder  in the evaluation  of chronic  shoulder  pain 
when  labral  pathology  or shoulder  instability  is suspected.  
CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
CT arthrograms  have  been  shown  to be an accurate modality  in the assessment  of shoulder  instability  because of  its 
depiction  of osseous,  cartilaginous,  and labroligamentous  injuries  [18,72] . Labral  evaluation  in the postoperative  
setting  may be better  with CT arthrography than MRI  in patients  with metallic  suture  anchors  [73] and has been  
used to evaluate for healing  after superior  labrum  anterior -to-posterior  (SLAP)  repair  [74]. Dual -energy  CT 
arthrography  has a similar  diagnostic  performance  as MR arthrography  [75]. Although CT arthrography aids in the 
evaluation  of underlying soft tissues,  the injected  contrast  may limit evaluation  of the underlying osseous structures,  
and cortical  fragments in the injected  contrast  solution  often  have a similar  attenuation  to cortical  bone  [76]. Other  
limitations  include  the need  for an invasive  arthrography procedure  and poor assessment  of bone  marrow  edema  
[72].

CT Shoulder  Without  IV Contrast  
CT is helpful  for assessing  bony  glenoid deficiency  as well as the size of a Hill-Sachs deformity  when  surgery  is a 
consideration  but is not effective at evaluating  the labrum.  CT is often  preferable  to MRI when  evaluating  for small  
fracture  fragments of the glenoid rim and assessing  bone  stock  in patients  with recurrent  dislocation  [77-79]. Three-
dimensional  reconstructions  can be used to quantify  osseous defect  width  and glenoid  surface area [80,81] . CT can 
also be used to measure the size of a Hill-Sachs defect  [82,83] , which  has become more  important  with the 
development  of the glenoid track  concept  for determining  instability  [84,85] . In the postoperative  setting, CT can 
be used to evaluate integration  of bone  graft  from  a coracoid  transfer  with the underlying glenoid [86,87] .

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 8 Shoulder Pain –Traumatic  Variant 2: Traumatic shoulder pain. Nonlocalized shoulder pain. Negative radiographs . Next imaging 
study. 
Appropriately positioned  radiographs can exclude shoulder dislocation and most displaced fractures as the 
etiology for post -traumatic shoulder pain. In the setting of normal shoulder radiographs, the most common causes 
of post -traumatic shoulder pain are soft -tissue injuries such  as rotator cuff and labral tears.  
MRI Shoulder  
Noncontrast MRI is a reasonable imaging study in the setting of acute nonlocalized traumatic shoulder pain and 
noncontributory radiographs. In the acute trauma setting, noncontrast MRI may be preferred to MR arthrography , 
as acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint effusion for assessment of intra -articular 
soft-tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic 
pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [34,35]. MRI is also sensitive for diagnosing bone marrow 
contusion and has  been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries in pediatric patients [ 36,37]. 
MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography has been found to be superior to noncontrast MRI in the diagnosis of labroligamentous and 
partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [17,19]. In the acute trauma setting, however, noncontrast MRI may be 
preferred to MR arthrography because acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint 
effusion for assessment of intra-arti cular soft -tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing 
extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [ 34,35]. MRI is also sensitive 
for diagnosing bone marrow contusion and has been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries 
in pediatric patients [ 36,37]. 
US Shoulder  
US has limited usefulness in patients with traumatic shoulder pain that cannot be localized to the rotator cuff or 
biceps tendon. I n the post -traumatic setting, US has been shown to detect abnormalities, including proximal 
humeral fractures [25]; however, recent studies on US performed for non specific shoulder pain have had 
conflicting results. US  for persistent shoulder pain after trauma has been found to diagnose significant pathology, 
primarily fractures and rotator cuff tears, in 90% of patients [ 25]. However, 40% of patients presenting with 
nonspecific shoulder pain were found to have no significant pathology on US [38]. Additionally,  US has been 
demonstrated to be inferior to MRI in assessment of labroligamentous, osseous, and rotator cuff pathology [ 17]. 
US can b e considered as a screening tool in patients with persistent nonspecific shoulder pain after trauma, 
particularly in an older patient population in whom rotator cuff tears are more common. However, a low threshold 
should be maintained for performing additi onal imaging in the setting of a noncontributory shoulder US  
exam ination . 
CT Shoulder  
CT has virtually no usefulness in diagnosing common traumatic soft -tissue injuries such as rotator cuff tears, 
labroligamentous injuries, and muscle tears. Although CT is  the gold standard for diagnosing and characterizing 
fractures, MRI has been shown to be equivalent to CT in diagnosing the nondisplaced fractures that are typically 
missed on radiographs.  
CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
CT is inferior to MRI and US  in diagnosing virtually all extra -articular traumatic soft -tissues injuries. CT is 
considered the gold standard in identifying fractures . However, MRI has shown to be equivalent to CT in 
assessing bone loss [12,18], and MRI is usually adequate for diagnosing the nondisplaced fractures that are 
typically missed on conventional radiographs. CT arthrography is able to reliably evaluat e for glenohumeral 
cartilage injury, SLAP tears, and labroligamentous injuries [ 12,39] but is generally considered inferior to MRI in 
diagnosing  rotator cuff and soft -tissue Bankart lesions [ 12].

practice, and US has been shown to be inferior to MRI in diagnosing the common structural abnormalities

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 12 Shoulder Pain –Traumatic  MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography is the preferred exam ination  for the evaluation of subacute shoulder dislocations or recurrent 
shoulder instability. MRI has been shown to have similar performance to CT in the evaluation of Hill-Sachs 
lesions and glenoid bone loss [12,18]. MR arthrography has also been found to be reliable in diagnosi ng anterior 
shoulder instability and labroligamentous injuries [58,59]. MR arthrography has specifically o utperformed 
noncontrast MRI in assessment of glenohumeral ligament and anterior labral injuries [ 17,19], which ar e 
commonly seen in shoulder instability. MR arthrogr aphy has also outperformed noncontrast MRI in diagnosis of 
rotator cuff tears [17,19], which is a common associated finding in older patients with shoulder dislocation. 
However, high sensitivities reported for MR arthrography in the detection of labral pathology may not be 
applicable to patients with clinically unstable shoulders. A retrospective review of 90 patients with clinically 
unstable shoulders selected for arthroscopy [ 60] found that MR arthrography had a sensitivity of 65% for 
detection of labral  tears. The authors proposed that this discrepancy with prior studies was the result of different 
patient selection criteria (clinically unstable in their study versus less-specific symptoms such as shoulder pain in 
others) and the interpretation of MR art hrography by experienced musculoskeletal radiologists [ 60]. For this 
document, it is assumed the procedure is performed and interpreted by an expert.  
MRI Shoulder  
MRI without contrast may be pre ferred to MR arthrography in the setting of acute shoulder dislocation when a 
post-traumatic joint effusion is present to provide sufficient visualization of soft -tissue structures. In the subacute 
or chronic setting, the glenohumeral joint effusion is usually too small to provide adequate joint distention for 
optimal assessment  of soft -tissue structures. Non contrast MRI has been shown to be inferior to MR arthrography 
in diagnosing labroligamentous and rotator cuff injuries [17,19]. Non contrast MRI performs comparably to CT in 
evaluating glenoid and humeral head bone loss [ 12,18], which may obviate the need for noncontrast CT . 
CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
CT arthrography is effective in evaluation of shoulder instability. CT arthrogr aphy is comparable to MR 
arthrography in the diagnosis of Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions [12] , and moderate agreement has been found 
between readers for diagnosing ant erior capsule laxity on CT arthrography. However, CT arthrography has been 
shown to be inferior to MR arthrography in assessing partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [12], which makes CT 
arthrography less desirable in older patients with dislocation/instability where rotator cuff tears are common. CT 
arthrography may be considered in a patient with shoulder dislocation/instabili ty and contraindication to MRI.  
CT Shoulder  
Noncontrast CT has historically been performed to assess bone loss in patients with recurrent dislocation or 
chronic instability. However, recent studies have shown MRI to be equivalent to CT in assessment of glenoid and 
humeral head bone loss [12,18], which places in question the need for noncontrast CT in the assessment of 
shoulder instability. Noncontrast CT is als o unable to assess rotator cuff and labroligamentous pathology 
commonly seen in shoulder dislocations/instability. In general, CT should be reserved for patients with a 
contraindication to MRI or patients in whom MRI assessment of bone loss is limited.  
US Shoulder  
There is no defined role for US  in the assessment of shoulder dislocation  or instability. There is a potential limited 
role for use of dynamic US in assessing Hill -Sachs lesion engagement [ 61].",True

demonstrate evolving  structural  changes or bone  formation,  although these changes occur  slowly  over time at the

US is not beneficial  as a diagnostic  tool for the evaluation  of sacroiliitis  in patients  with suspected  axSpA  because 
of its lack of established  diagnostic  utility  [22]. Importantly,  US provides  limited  evaluation  of the superficial  
posterior  margins  of the spine,  and therefore  many  structural  details  are not demonstrated.  There is a paucity  of 
evidence literature  evaluating  US in the spine  in patients  with axSpA.  One study demonstrat es that resistive indices

Fluoride  PET/CT Skull Base to Mid-Thigh 
There is not enough data to support  the routine  use of PET/CT in the evaluation  of patients  with suspected  axSpA.  
F-18-fluoride  has been  shown  to be a potentially  useful  tracer  in identifying  sites of osteoblastic activity  in axSpA  
patients  [64,65] . Uptake on PET/CT has also been  shown  to correlate with clinical  disease activity  in patients with 
axSpA  [66,67] ; however,  there is conflicting  evidence regarding the extent  to which  tracer  uptake  correlates with 
specific inflammatory  and structural  lesions seen on CT and MRI resulting  in uncertain ty about  its diagnostic  utility  
[64,67- 72]. In one study,  the interreader  reliability  of diagnosing  sacroiliitis  on PET/CT was poor and substantially  
lower  than that for MRI or CT [67]. In a small  study using  radiographs  as the reference standard,  F-18-fluoride  
PET/CT had a sensitivity  of 80% and specificity  of 77% for the detection  of sacroiliitis  in AS, although  there are 
inherent  limitations  in the use of radiographs  as the reference standard  for diagnosing  axSpA  [73]. Given  the 
available data,  the utility  of PET/CT in the diagnosis  of axSpA , including its utility  in assessment  of the spine,  is 
uncertain  at this time.  
MRI Spine  Area  of Interest  
Although MRI  of the sacroiliac joints  has high utility  for the diagnosis  of axSpA,  some  patients  will not demonstrate  
imaging  features of axSpA  in the sacroiliac joints  on MRI as indicated  by sensitivities  of all studies to varying 
degrees below  100%  [22], and therefore  some  patients may need  further imaging  evaluation  with MRI given that it 
is the imaging  modality  of choice for the diagnosis  of axSpA  [1,3,19,22] . Studies  have  shown  widely varying  
degrees of isolated  spinal  involvement  on MRI in axSpA  ranging from  1% to 49% [19,59-63,114,115] . Therefore,  
imag ing of the spine  is beneficial  for patients  in whom  there is suspicion  for axSpA  but imaging  of the sacroiliac 
joints  has been  negative.  Some  authors  have  shown  the utility  of using  whole -spine  or whole -body  MRI to identify  
the burden of disease rather  than selecting  specific areas of the spine  to image  because findings  may be potentially  
isolated  to any portion of the spine  [10,59,63,89,114,120-122] . 
The spine  MRI  findings  of axSpA  include  the active inflammatory  changes of spondylitis  and spondylodiscitis,  the 
inflammatory  changes of the costovertebral  joints,  costotransverse joints,  and facet  joints  and areas of enthesitis

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 5 Acute Hand and Wrist Trauma  Most fractures of the thumb are visible on a 2-view radiographic examination, although there is a slight increase 
in dia gnostic yield with the addition of an oblique projection [ 13], which can be obtained along with a PA 
examination of the whole hand.  
In patients with suspected finger tendon injuries, radiographs are used to detect fracture fragments, as large 
fragments may require open reduction and internal fixation.  Radiographs are usually sufficient for  the evaluation 
of osseous “mallet” injuries, which include bony avulsion at the insertion of the extensor mechanism of the finger 
to the distal interphalangeal joint [16]. In these injuries, involvement of more than one -third of the articular 
surface usually requires operative fixation.  Palmar displacement of the distal phalanx or an interfragmentary gap 
of >3 mm is also an indication for surgery [ 16]. With extensor tendon injuries, radiographs are commonly used to 
assess for bone involve ment and determine need for operative fixation [ 17]. 
CT Area of Interest  
In patients with intra -articular fractures seen on radiography , CT shows articular fracture fragment displacement, 
depression, and comminution more accurately than conventional radiographs [ 7,9,10]. CT measurements of 
articular surface gap and step -off are more reproducible than radiographs [7]. The addition of 3- D surface -
rendered reconstructions to the standard 2 -D CT images has been shown to change operative management in up to 
48% of intra -articular distal radius fractures [8]. 
There is no evidence to support the use of CT with intravenous  (IV) contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist 
trauma.

Variant 2: Suspect acute hand or wrist trauma. Initial radiographs nega tive or equivocal. Next imaging

Radiograph y Area of Interest  
In patients with clinical suspicion of hand or wrist fracture and negative radiographs, one option is to place the 
patient in a short arm cast and repeat the radiographs at 10  to 14 days [ 13]. The downside of this option is that it 
results in delay of diagnosis , which may lead to functional impairment . 
CT Area of Interest  
When the initial radiographs are equivocal, CT  without IV contrast  is commonly used to exclude or confirm 
suspected wrist fractures [18]. CT shows intra-articular extension of distal radius fractures more frequently than 
radiography.  Three-dimensional reconstructions can be particularly helpful in preoperative planning for complex 
articular injuries  [7,8]. 
CT should be used to exclude an occult fracture of the upper extremity. Unlike MRI, CT cannot evaluate for 
concomitant ligamentous injuries  [19-21 ]. 
CT is useful in diagnosing injuries that are difficult to recognize on radiographs, such as carpometacarpal joint 
fracture dislocations. For metacarpal and digital  fractures, CT is usually not indicated during acute injury [ 22]. 
There is no evidence to support the use of CT with IV contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist trauma.  
MRI Area o f Interest  
When initial radiographs are normal but there is high clinical suspicion for fracture, MRI without IV contrast can 
detect fractures of the distal radius and carpal bones [12,23-25] . One study of patients in which the radiographic 
findings did not explain the clinical symptoms reported that the MRI led to a change in diagnosis in 55% of 
patients and a change in patient management in 66%  [12]. However, another study of patients with acutely injured 
wrists reported that the MRI did not predict the need for treatment better than the combination of physical 
examination and radiography [ 23]. More importantly, there was no difference in outcomes  with MRI compared 
with radiography [24].

Several meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the 
carpal  tunnel  inlet) is highly accurate for identifying carpal  tunnel syndrome  diagnosed clinically or with the 
combination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US 
varies depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the 
measurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary 
examination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel 
syndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal 
tunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, 
clinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of 
carpal tunnel syndrome. US may be appropriate in cases where this initial evaluation is equivocal.  
MRI Wrist  
Historically, carpal tunnel syndrome has been diagnosed based on clinical signs and sympt oms and confirmed by 
the results of electrodiagnostic studies [67]. MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in cases in which this  
initial evaluation is equivocal. The MRI findings that have been reported in wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome —
including nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing—may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value 
in patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68]. In rare cases of secondary carpal tunnel syndrome, MRI may identify 
a mass lesion compressing the median nerve. There is some evidence that the length of T2 hyperintensity in the 
median nerve can help prognosticate the success of surgery [69] and that the shape and signal of the nerve predict 
clinical response to a steroid injection in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome [70 ]. MR neurography 
may be an option in patients with suspected carpal tunnel syndrome.  The use o f IV contrast does not contribute to 
diagnosis and is usually not appropriate.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 10 Chronic Wrist Pain  importantly, though, the finding of enhancing bone marrow “edema” (osteitis) on MRI studies in patients with 
early RA is proving to be the best single predictor of future disease progression and functional dete rioration, even 
compared to serologies and clinical measures [27, 28,32-34].  
US Wrist  
The diagnosis of a specific inflammatory arthritis is typically established based on clinical and laboratory 
analysis. Advanced imaging is usually performed to determine disease activity, guide management decisions, and prognosticate outcomes. In patients with RA, US  of the wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints can  show 
inflammation  as active synovitis. Identifying active synovitis with power Doppler assessment is a useful adjunct 
in making an early diagnosis of RA when a pati ent with early arthritis does not meet the 2010 criteria established 
by the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism [20]. The presence of 
synovitis predicts progression of erosions [31 ] and erosions themselves [35]. US can also depict small bone 
erosions with high spatial resolution; h owever, US is less sensitive to erosions that occur on the radial or ulnar 
sides of the inner carpal bones because direct scanning of these regions is blocked, unlike the dorsal and volar 
bone surfaces. Furthermore, unlike MRI, US cannot show changes within the bone marrow, which are  the 
strongest prognosticator s for disease progression in RA [27, 28,32-34].  In patients with established inflammatory 
arthritis who are undergoing therapy, judging progression or reduction of synovitis may be more difficult with 
sequential US compared to sequential MRI.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
MR arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected inflammatory 
arthritides. 
CT Wrist  
While CT is more sensitive than radiographs for erosions, CT is not routinely used for the diagnosis and 
management of patients with suspected inflammatory arthritides . 
CT Arthrography  Wrist  
CT arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected inflammatory 
arthritides. 
Bone Scan  Wrist

Arthrography  Wrist  
Radiographic arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected

Variant 4: Chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or show nonspecific ar thritis. Exclude infection. Next 
study. 
Aspiration  Wrist  
No literature directly addresses the appropriateness of imaging studies beyond radiographs in patients with 
suspected infection in the wrist. However, generalizing from experience with septic arthrit is in other joints, joint 
aspiration should not be delayed in order to obtain advanced imaging studies. In cases of suspected septic arthritis, 
percutaneous aspiration of the wrist is indicated, even when radiographs appear normal. Aspirates should be 
analyzed by cell count, gram stain, and appropriate cultures. Microscopic crystal analysis should also be obtained 
if there is a possibility of gout, acute pseudogout, or hydroxyapatite deposition disease. Aspiration can be 
performed without imaging guidance i f the joint is distended, but either fluoroscopy or US  may be useful if a 
specific compartment is to be targeted.  
MRI Wrist  
There may be a role for MRI with IV contrast enhancement in the staging of infections (for example, to delineate the location and extent of soft-tissue abscesses)  after aspiration has been performed.  Especially in chronic cases, 
MRI with IV contrast may be useful to identify a fluid collection or joint effusion to target  for aspiration.  
However, MRI is usually not appropriate as the next study after radiographs for suspected wrist infections.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
MR arthrography is not routinely used to evaluate suspected wrist infection.

• When radiographs are normal or equivocal and a patient has persistent symptoms wi th an unclear diagnosis, 
MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate.  
• In patients with suspected inflammatory arthritis, MRI either with or without IV contrast is usually 
appropriate if guidance for management or prognostication is needed.  
• Patients with  suspected wrist infection should undergo aspiration.  
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal in a patient with ulnar -sided pain, either MRI without IV contrast 
or an MR arthrogram of the wrist is usually appropriate.  
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal in a patient with radial -sided pain, MRI without IV contrast is 
usually appropriate.

MRI is ideal for evaluating tendon injuries and helping with surgical planning [58, 59]. MRI is comm only used for 
the diagnosis of  Stener lesions of the thumb [60] and the diagnosis of pulley system injuries [61]. 
Hergan et al [62] reported a 100% sensitivity and specificity for assessment of thumb ulnar collateral ligament 
tears. Spaeth et al [ 63] reported a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 94% for detection of displaced ulnar 
collateral ligament tears in 16 cadaveric specimens.  
US Hand  
A Stener lesion occurs when the aponeurosis of the adductor pollicis muscle becomes interposed between the 
ruptured ulnar collateral ligament of the thumb and its site  of insertion at the base of the proximal phalanx. This 
lesion can be identified by absence of ulnar collateral ligament and the presence of a hypoechoic mass proximal to 
the apex of the metacarpal tubercle [64]. Dynamic examination shows the relationship of the aponeurosis to the 
retracted ligament stump [65] . 
US allows for diagnosis of pulley system injuries [ 66,67]. 
Bone Scan Hand 
Bone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  
Variant 6: Initial radiographs showing metaca rpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, or distal 
interphalangeal joint malalignment in the absence of fracture. Next imaging study.  
CT Hand  
CT has limited use for the diagnosis of soft -tissue injuries of the fingers.  
MRI Hand  
MRI is ideal for evaluating tendon injuries and helping with surgical planning [58]. MRI may be used to assess 
capsule and collateral ligament injuries of the proximal interphalangeal  and metacarpophalangeal joints [68]. 
For flexor tendon injuries, Rubin et al [ 69] reported a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of  100% in cadavers.  
Drapé et al  [58] reported sensitivity and specificity of 100% for diagnosis of tendon re -tears after flexor tend on 
repair and a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 100% for diagnosis of peritendinous adhesions in 63 injured 
fingers.  Jersey finger refers to avulsion injury of flexor digitorum profundus from  insertion at base of distal 
phalanx. In patients with jers ey finger, MRI is commonly used to evaluate the level of tendon retraction, the 
quality of the tendon stump, and the associated injuries including pulley injuries [16]. In clinically equivocal 
cases, MRI may demonstrate injury to the central slip or the extensor hood [ 16]. 
MRI allows for the assessment of pulley system lesions [ 66,67]. MRI can accurately depict the pulley system, 
particularly the A2 and A4 pulleys, with lower sensitivity for A3 and A5 pulleys [ 70]. Hauger et al  [70] reported 
direct identification of A2  and A4 pulleys in 12 of 12 cases (100%) and direct diagnosis of an abnormal A2 pulley 
in 100% and A4 pulley in 91% of 33 cases.  
For volar plat e injuries, MRI may be used to diagnose tears that do not involve the underlying bone [71]. This is 
important  because untreated lesions can result in contractures or joint laxity [ 72]. 
MRI of the extensor system has not been as well studied as that of the flexor system.  Drapé et al [73] reported a 
sensitivity of 89 % to 92% for evaluation of normal sagittal bands of the extensor hood.  For the detection of 
extensor hood injuries, MRI sensitivity ranges from 28% to 85% [ 74]. 
MRI is especially useful for detection of ulnar collateral ligament and radial collateral ligament injuries.  
Pfirrmann et al [74] reported a sensitivity of 67% and a specificity of 91% for collateral ligament injuries of the 
lesser metacarpophalangeal joints. With MR arthrography, sensitivity and specificity increased to 75% and 98%, 
respectively [74].

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Hand injuries account for approximately 20% of emergency department visits [ 1]. According to the National 
Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey , 1.5% of all emergency department visits involve  hand and wrist 
fractu res. Distal radius fractures are especially common, accounting for up to 18% of fractures in the elderly [ 2,3]. 
Because of increasing rates of osteoporosis, the incidence of distal radius fractures has been increasing [ 4]. 
Although most distal radius fractures in e lderly patients are managed non operatively, the use of internal fixation is 
increasing. Internal fixation has a much higher cost than nonopera tive treatment as well as increased rates of 
hospitalization [5]. 
For most patients with trauma to the hand and wrist, conventional radiographs provide sufficient diagnostic 
information to guide the treating physician.  However, delayed diagnosis is common because distal radius and 
scaphoid fractures may be radiographically occult  [6]. When initial radiographs  are normal but there is high 
clinical suspicion for fracture, further imaging with additional radiographic pr ojections, CT, or MRI  is 
appropriate . If associated soft -tissue injury is clinically suspected, CT, CT arthrography, MR I, MR arthrography, 
or ultrasound (US) may be indicated  [7-10]. 
Successful treatment of distal radius fractures requires restoration of radial length, inclination, and tilt, as well as 
the realignment of the articular fracture fragments [9,11]. The presence of a coronally  oriented fracture line, die -
punch depression, or more than three articular fracture fragments are common indications for operative reduction 
[8]. Operative fixation resulting in < 2 mm of residual articular surface step-off is usually considered necessary to 
avoid long-term complications , such as osteoarthritis [9 ,12]. 
Discussion of Procedures by Variant  
Variant 1: Acute blunt or penetrating trauma to the hand or wrist. Initial imaging.  
Radiograph y Area of Interest  
Radiography is  always indicated as the initial imaging for suspected acute hand and wrist trauma.  For m ost joints 
of the extremities, especially those involving the wrist, hand, and fingers, a radiographic examination that 
includes only 2 views is not adequate for detecting fractures [13]. For patients with suspected  distal radius 
fractures, a 3-view examination  of the wrist  usually includes a posteroanterior (PA) , a lateral, and a 45° 
semi pronated oblique view  [11]. One study [ 14] reports that a fourth projection—a semisupinated oblique —
increases diagnostic yield for distal radius fractures.  
A standard 3 -view radiographic examination of the hand shows most fractures and dislocations of the metacarpals 
and phalanges [ 13]. For phalangeal injuries, some centers include a PA examination of the entire hand, whereas 
others limit the examination to the injured finger.  An internally rotated oblique project ion, in addition to the 
standard externally rotated oblique, increases diagnostic yield for phalangeal fractures [15].

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 5 Acute Hand and Wrist Trauma  Most fractures of the thumb are visible on a 2-view radiographic examination, although there is a slight increase 
in dia gnostic yield with the addition of an oblique projection [ 13], which can be obtained along with a PA 
examination of the whole hand.  
In patients with suspected finger tendon injuries, radiographs are used to detect fracture fragments, as large 
fragments may require open reduction and internal fixation.  Radiographs are usually sufficient for  the evaluation 
of osseous “mallet” injuries, which include bony avulsion at the insertion of the extensor mechanism of the finger 
to the distal interphalangeal joint [16]. In these injuries, involvement of more than one -third of the articular 
surface usually requires operative fixation.  Palmar displacement of the distal phalanx or an interfragmentary gap 
of >3 mm is also an indication for surgery [ 16]. With extensor tendon injuries, radiographs are commonly used to 
assess for bone involve ment and determine need for operative fixation [ 17]. 
CT Area of Interest  
In patients with intra -articular fractures seen on radiography , CT shows articular fracture fragment displacement, 
depression, and comminution more accurately than conventional radiographs [ 7,9,10]. CT measurements of 
articular surface gap and step -off are more reproducible than radiographs [7]. The addition of 3- D surface -
rendered reconstructions to the standard 2 -D CT images has been shown to change operative management in up to 
48% of intra -articular distal radius fractures [8]. 
There is no evidence to support the use of CT with intravenous  (IV) contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist 
trauma.  
MRI Area of Interest  
MRI is not indicated initially in this clinical setting. 
US Area of Interest  
US is not indicated initially in this clinical setting. 
Bone Scan Area of  Interest  
Bone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  
Variant 2: Suspect acute hand or wrist trauma. Initial radiographs nega tive or equivocal. Next imaging 
study. 
Radiograph y Area of Interest  
In patients with clinical suspicion of hand or wrist fracture and negative radiographs, one option is to place the 
patient in a short arm cast and repeat the radiographs at 10  to 14 days [ 13]. The downside of this option is that it 
results in delay of diagnosis , which may lead to functional impairment . 
CT Area of Interest  
When the initial radiographs are equivocal, CT  without IV contrast  is commonly used to exclude or confirm 
suspected wrist fractures [18]. CT shows intra-articular extension of distal radius fractures more frequently than 
radiography.  Three-dimensional reconstructions can be particularly helpful in preoperative planning for complex 
articular injuries  [7,8]. 
CT should be used to exclude an occult fracture of the upper extremity. Unlike MRI, CT cannot evaluate for 
concomitant ligamentous injuries  [19-21 ]. 
CT is useful in diagnosing injuries that are difficult to recognize on radiographs, such as carpometacarpal joint 
fracture dislocations. For metacarpal and digital  fractures, CT is usually not indicated during acute injury [ 22]. 
There is no evidence to support the use of CT with IV contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist trauma.  
MRI Area o f Interest  
When initial radiographs are normal but there is high clinical suspicion for fracture, MRI without IV contrast can 
detect fractures of the distal radius and carpal bones [12,23-25] . One study of patients in which the radiographic 
findings did not explain the clinical symptoms reported that the MRI led to a change in diagnosis in 55% of 
patients and a change in patient management in 66%  [12]. However, another study of patients with acutely injured 
wrists reported that the MRI did not predict the need for treatment better than the combination of physical 
examination and radiography [ 23]. More importantly, there was no difference in outcomes  with MRI compared 
with radiography [24].",True

Page Content: Altho ugh the technology holds promise, diagnostic accuracy does not yet 
approach that of MRI , with an  initial study by Reddy et al [49] demonstrating a sensitivity of 90% and specificity 
of 40% for nondisplaced femoral neck fractures . However, this may be a modality of emerging imp ortance as 
technology improves.  
US Hip 
The use of US  for evaluation of the acutely painful hip has been evaluated in a single study of 10 patients  with hip 
fractures [36]. Although US was able to identify trauma-related changes,  such as joint effusion , with 100% 
sensitivity , specificity for fracture reached only 65%. The authors acknowledged that performance might further 
decrease for examinations performed by sonographers and radiologists not experienced with musculoskeletal US . 
For this document , it is assumed the procedure is performed and interpreted by an expert.  Given the inability of 
US to comprehensively evaluate the bones and soft  tissues of the pelvis, there is not enough evidence to support 
the role of US  in the workup of radiographically occult hip fracture.

Page Content: Measurements can be performed  on radiography,  CT, and MRI [42-44,47,48] . Sometimes  limited  images  of the 
knees may be obtained  as part of the hip CT to evaluate for femoral  version;  occasionally  knee  pathology may be 
identified  on these images  as a possible  cause of the patient’s  hip pain [49]. 
Fluoride  PET/CT Skull Base to Mid-Thigh 
One study demonstrated  the potential use of fluoride  PET to demonstrate increased  bone  turnover  in the setting  of 
chronic  hip pain and FAI [50]. One other  study  demonstrated  that fluoride  PET can demonstrate acetabular  
contrecoup injuries  in patients  with FAI [51]. However,  increased  radiotracer  uptake  is a nonspecific  finding,  and, 
overall,  there is insufficient  literature  to support  the use of fluoride  PET/CT skull base to mid-thigh in the evaluation  
of chronic  hip pain thought  to be due to hip impingement  and/or  dysplasia.  
Image -Guided Anesthetic +/- Corticosteroid  Injection  Hip Joint  or Surrounding  Structures  
Fluoroscopic -, CT-, or US-guided anesthetic and/or  corticosteroid  injections  can be a useful  tool for clarifying  the 
source of a patient’s  chronic  hip pain.  In addition  to intra-articular  injections, selective trochanteric  and iliopsoas  
bursal/peritendinous  injections  can be performed  for both diagnostic  or therapeutic purposes  using anesthetic and/or  
corticosteroid  injectate,  respectively.  Symptomatic  relief  following  selective injection  of particular  structure(s)  can 
help to define  the etiology  of the patient’s symptoms  and can guide  future  therapy  [19-22].

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Fractures of the proximal femur (commonly referred to as hip fractures)  are a frequent  source of morbidity and 
mortality in elderly osteoporotic patients [1]. Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type 
result in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men 
[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs 
will continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of 
life following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays 
in diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -
and long-term mortality [6-13]. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of hip fractures is critical. Hip fractures 
cannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded on the basis of physical exam ination  alone ; therefore , imaging plays a 
key role in early  and accurate diagnosis [14] . 
The biomechanics of proximal femoral and pelvic fractures that are a result of major trauma differs as these 
injuries may be seen in any age group, often with additional accompanying high-velocity injuri es of the abdomen 
and pelvis . Motor vehicle –related trauma is the most common  mechanism. Thorough evaluation of the hip may be 
superseded  in these instances by the need for resuscitation and diagnosis and treatment of more urgent associated 
vascular or solid organ injuries. Imaging plays an important role not only in the diagnosis of high-velocity 
fractures but also in characterizing fracture mechanism and morphology for treatment planning purposes.  
However, imaging of high-velocity hip fractures occurs in the context of a broader trauma evaluation. A full 
discussion of the broader imaging workup of blunt trauma is beyond the scope of this paper and will be covered in 
the upcoming ACR Appropriateness Criteria® titled “Major Blunt Trauma” and will be made available on the 
ACR website  when completed . 
Treatment  for both intra - and extracapsular proximal femoral fractures in the elderly is typically surgical fixation  
because of the risk of further fracture displacement and the dangers of prolonged immobilization in the elderly 
[15]. Joint replacement may be  performed for displaced fractures of the femoral neck where the risk of femoral 
head avascular necrosis is high. Fractures from high -force trauma are also commonly treated with surgical 
fixation for stability to reduce the risk of post -traumatic osteo arthritis. 
Discussion of Procedures by Variant  
Variant 1:  Acute hip pain. Fall or minor trauma. Suspect fracture. Initial imaging.  
Radiography Hip 
Radiography is the initial imaging modality of choice for assessment of acute hip pain with suspected fracture , 
with the more advanced imaging modalities reserved for instances of clinically suspected fracture in the setting of 
negative or equivocal radiographs. Radiographs are rapidly obtained and well tolerated by patients. When a 
fracture is demonstrated , freque ntly no more imaging is needed for treatment planning purposes [15 -17].

Radiography Hip 
The literature  indicates that radiography  is a first-line screening  tool, and hip radiographs  are useful  in the initial 
imaging  workup of chronic  hip pain [12]. Oftentimes  a pelvic radiograph,  which  includes  imaging  of both hips,  
may be obtained concurrently with additional  dedicated  collimated  radiograph(s)  of the affected  hip(s). Findings  on 
hip radiographs  can result  in an imaging  diagnosis  such as osteoarthritis  or can lead to more  advanced  workups  of 
less common causes of chronic  hip pain such as primary  bone  tumors.  The results of screening  hip radiographs  can 
help guide  the use of additional  imaging  studies such as more  specialized  radiographic  views  or more  advanced  
modalities  such as CT, ultrasound (US), MRI,  radionuclide  bone  scans,  and fluoride  PET [13-15].

for evaluation  of both hip joints  on a single  radiographic  image,  allowing  for comparison  of the ipsilateral  and 
contralateral  hips.  Oftentimes,  a pelvic  radiograph may be obtained concurrently with additional  dedicated  
radiograph(s)  of the affected  hip. Findings  on pelvic  radiographs  can result  in an imaging  diagnosis  such as

There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of MR arthrography of the hip in the initial evaluation  of chronic  
hip pain.  
MRI Hip Without and With  IV Contrast  
There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of MRI of the hip without  and with IV contrast  in the initial 
evaluation  of chronic  hip pain.  
MRI Hip Without IV Contrast  
There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of MRI of the hip without IV contrast  in the initial evaluation  of 
chronic  hip pain.  
Radiography Hip 
The literature  indicates that radiography  is a first-line screening  tool, and hip radiographs  are useful  in the initial 
imaging  workup of chronic  hip pain [12]. Oftentimes  a pelvic radiograph,  which  includes  imaging  of both hips,  
may be obtained concurrently with additional  dedicated  collimated  radiograph(s)  of the affected  hip(s). Findings  on 
hip radiographs  can result  in an imaging  diagnosis  such as osteoarthritis  or can lead to more  advanced  workups  of 
less common causes of chronic  hip pain such as primary  bone  tumors.  The results of screening  hip radiographs  can 
help guide  the use of additional  imaging  studies such as more  specialized  radiographic  views  or more  advanced  
modalities  such as CT, ultrasound (US), MRI,  radionuclide  bone  scans,  and fluoride  PET [13-15]. 
Radiography Pelvis  
The literature  indicates that radiography  is a first-line screening  tool, and pelvic  radiographs  are useful  in the initial 
imaging  workup of chronic  hip pain [12]. A pelvic  radiograph  is an excellent  initial examination  because it allows  
for evaluation  of both hip joints  on a single  radiographic  image,  allowing  for comparison  of the ipsilateral  and 
contralateral  hips.  Oftentimes,  a pelvic  radiograph may be obtained concurrently with additional  dedicated  
radiograph(s)  of the affected  hip. Findings  on pelvic  radiographs  can result  in an imaging  diagnosis  such as 
osteoarthritis  or may lead to more  advanced  workups  of less common  causes of chronic  hip pain such as primary  
bone  tumors.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 10 Chronic  Hip Pain Radiography Hip Additional Views 
For further evaluation  of disorders  such as dysplasia or FAI, specialized  views such as the false  profile  or elongated  
femoral  neck  lateral  (Dunn)  views  can provide  more  detailed  evaluation  of the anatomy  of the femoral  head  and 
neck  and the degree of acetabular  coverage of the femoral  head  [47]. 
US Hip 
In general,  US is limited  in its use for evaluating  osseous structures.  However,  there is limited  literature  that 
demonstrates that US can be used to evaluate osseous features of FAI such as the alpha -angle  [73]. However,  US is 
not able to adequately  evaluate osseous abnormalities  deep  to the cortex.  One of the advantages  of US is its ability  
to dynamically  evaluate for extra-articular  soft tissue  impingement.  US is not as sensitive as MRI or CT 
arthrography  for the detection  of labral  tears  [17], but it can be useful  for the detection  and localization  of paralabral  
cysts for aspiration  and injection  [39,41] . 
Variant  4: Chronic  hip pain. Suspect  labral tear.  Radiographs  negative  or nondiagnostic. Next  imaging  
study. 
Bone  Scan  Hip 
There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of bone  scan of the hip for the workup of an acetabular  labral  tear 
in a patient  with chronic  hip pain.  
CT Arthrography  Hip 
Some  authors  have  shown  that CT arthrography  can be useful  in the detection  of acetabular  labral  tears [17,74] , 
which  may be associated  with FAI, but other  authors  have  shown  that CT arthrography is not very good for the 
detection  of labral  tears [18].  
CT Hip With  IV Contrast  
There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of CT hip with IV contrast  for the workup  of an acetabular  labral  
tear in a patient  with chronic  hip pain.  
CT Hip Without  and With  IV Contrast  
There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of CT hip without and with IV contrast  for the workup  of an 
acetabular  labral  tear in a patient  with chronic  hip pain.  
CT Hip Without  IV Contrast  
Because of  its inherent  poor contrast  resolution,  there  is no relevant  literature  support ing the use of CT hip without  
IV contrast  for the workup of an acetabular  labral  tear in a patient  with chronic  hip pain.  
Fluoride  PET/CT Skull Base to Mid-Thigh 
There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of fluoride  PET/CT skull base to mid-thigh in the evaluation  of 
chronic  hip pain thought  to be due to a labral  tear. 
Image -Guided Anesthetic +/- Corticosteroid  Injection  Hip Joint  or Surrounding  Structures  
Diagnostic joint injections  are safe and useful  tools  for confirming  the etiology  of pain, such as a labral  tear or 
symptomatic  paralabral  cyst [20-22]. 
MR Arthrography  Hip 
Direct  MR arthrography,  with the intraarticular  injection  of a 1:200 solution  of gadolinium  chelate in saline,  has 
been  established  as a reliable  technique  for diagnosing acetabular  labral  tears [75-80]  that are frequently  associated  
with FAI [81,82] . MR arthrography has been  shown  to have  a sensitivity  of 94.5%  and a specificity  of 100%  for 
the detection  of labral  tears [52].

Guideline: ACR chronic hip pain.pdf, Page: 8
Page Content: Measurements can be performed  on radiography,  CT, and MRI [42-44,47,48] . Sometimes  limited  images  of the 
knees may be obtained  as part of the hip CT to evaluate for femoral  version;  occasionally  knee  pathology may be 
identified  on these images  as a possible  cause of the patient’s  hip pain [49]. 
Fluoride  PET/CT Skull Base to Mid-Thigh 
One study demonstrated  the potential use of fluoride  PET to demonstrate increased  bone  turnover  in the setting  of 
chronic  hip pain and FAI [50]. One other  study  demonstrated  that fluoride  PET can demonstrate acetabular  
contrecoup injuries  in patients  with FAI [51]. However,  increased  radiotracer  uptake  is a nonspecific  finding,  and, 
overall,  there is insufficient  literature  to support  the use of fluoride  PET/CT skull base to mid-thigh in the evaluation  
of chronic  hip pain thought  to be due to hip impingement  and/or  dysplasia.  
Image -Guided Anesthetic +/- Corticosteroid  Injection  Hip Joint  or Surrounding  Structures  
Fluoroscopic -, CT-, or US-guided anesthetic and/or  corticosteroid  injections  can be a useful  tool for clarifying  the 
source of a patient’s  chronic  hip pain.  In addition  to intra-articular  injections, selective trochanteric  and iliopsoas  
bursal/peritendinous  injections  can be performed  for both diagnostic  or therapeutic purposes  using anesthetic and/or  
corticosteroid  injectate,  respectively.  Symptomatic  relief  following  selective injection  of particular  structure(s)  can 
help to define  the etiology  of the patient’s symptoms  and can guide  future  therapy  [19-22].

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Fractures of the proximal femur (commonly referred to as hip fractures)  are a frequent  source of morbidity and 
mortality in elderly osteoporotic patients [1]. Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type 
result in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men 
[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs 
will continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of 
life following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays 
in diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -
and long-term mortality [6-13]. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of hip fractures is critical. Hip fractures 
cannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded on the basis of physical exam ination  alone ; therefore , imaging plays a 
key role in early  and accurate diagnosis [14] . 
The biomechanics of proximal femoral and pelvic fractures that are a result of major trauma differs as these 
injuries may be seen in any age group, often with additional accompanying high-velocity injuri es of the abdomen 
and pelvis . Motor vehicle –related trauma is the most common  mechanism. Thorough evaluation of the hip may be 
superseded  in these instances by the need for resuscitation and diagnosis and treatment of more urgent associated 
vascular or solid organ injuries. Imaging plays an important role not only in the diagnosis of high-velocity 
fractures but also in characterizing fracture mechanism and morphology for treatment planning purposes.  
However, imaging of high-velocity hip fractures occurs in the context of a broader trauma evaluation. A full 
discussion of the broader imaging workup of blunt trauma is beyond the scope of this paper and will be covered in 
the upcoming ACR Appropriateness Criteria® titled “Major Blunt Trauma” and will be made available on the 
ACR website  when completed . 
Treatment  for both intra - and extracapsular proximal femoral fractures in the elderly is typically surgical fixation  
because of the risk of further fracture displacement and the dangers of prolonged immobilization in the elderly 
[15]. Joint replacement may be  performed for displaced fractures of the femoral neck where the risk of femoral 
head avascular necrosis is high. Fractures from high -force trauma are also commonly treated with surgical 
fixation for stability to reduce the risk of post -traumatic osteo arthritis. 
Discussion of Procedures by Variant  
Variant 1:  Acute hip pain. Fall or minor trauma. Suspect fracture. Initial imaging.  
Radiography Hip 
Radiography is the initial imaging modality of choice for assessment of acute hip pain with suspected fracture , 
with the more advanced imaging modalities reserved for instances of clinically suspected fracture in the setting of 
negative or equivocal radiographs. Radiographs are rapidly obtained and well tolerated by patients. When a 
fracture is demonstrated , freque ntly no more imaging is needed for treatment planning purposes [15 -17].

Guideline: ACR acute hip pain suspected fracture.pdf, Page: 5
Page Content: Altho ugh the technology holds promise, diagnostic accuracy does not yet 
approach that of MRI , with an  initial study by Reddy et al [49] demonstrating a sensitivity of 90% and specificity 
of 40% for nondisplaced femoral neck fractures . However, this may be a modality of emerging imp ortance as 
technology improves.  
US Hip 
The use of US  for evaluation of the acutely painful hip has been evaluated in a single study of 10 patients  with hip 
fractures [36]. Although US was able to identify trauma-related changes,  such as joint effusion , with 100% 
sensitivity , specificity for fracture reached only 65%. The authors acknowledged that performance might further 
decrease for examinations performed by sonographers and radiologists not experienced with musculoskeletal US . 
For this document , it is assumed the procedure is performed and interpreted by an expert.  Given the inability of 
US to comprehensively evaluate the bones and soft  tissues of the pelvis, there is not enough evidence to support 
the role of US  in the workup of radiographically occult hip fracture.",False

Explanation: Based on the patient's profile, he is a 50-year-old male who twisted his right ankle while jogging. He has been experiencing pain since the incident but is able to walk normally. On examination, there is no point tenderness at the ankle or midfoot, and he has a full range of motion with mild pain on foot supination. The MRI without IV contrast is ordered to assess for ligamentous injury, which is a common imaging modality for evaluating ligamentous integrity in cases of chronic ankle pain.

Stress views are not routinely used for the evaluation of suspected tendon abnormality.  
Variant 5: Chronic ankle pain. Ankle radiographs normal or nonspecific, suspected ankle instability. Next study . 
In the absence of findings on routine radiography, imaging options to evaluate ligamentous integrity include stress radiography, MRI, MR arthrography, CT arthrography, and US.  
MRI  
One study eva luating anterior talofibular ligament injury demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy of 97% for MRI 
when compared to arthroscopic findings. Additionally, MRI identified the exact location of the injury in 93% of 
the cases [15].  Comparing MRI with arthroscopy, studies have shown a range of accuracies of chronic lateral 
ligament tearing (either partial or complete), ranging from 77 % to 92% for the anterior talofibular ligament and 
88% to 92% for the calcaneofibular ligament [14, 52]. For the evaluation of deep deltoid ligament tears, MRI is 
both sensitive and specific compared with arthroscopy, with reported values of 96% and 98%, respectively [53].  
With regard to tears of the tibiofibular ligaments of the tibiofibular syndesmosis, MRI has a reported accuracy of 100% [54]. Additionally, MRI can also demonstrate interosseous membrane tears [55]. MRI offers the advantage 
of evaluating for injuries associated with or mimicking lateral instability that may not be diagnosed on stress radiography such as tenosynovitis, tendon injury, and osteochondral lesions [56]. MRI may also be used to evaluate the ankle after lateral ligament reconstruction [57].  
MR Arthrography  
MR arthrography can be helpful for the assessment of chronic ankle instability due to lateral collateral ligament injuries [12].  
US 
One study evaluating anterior talofibular ligamen t injury demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy of 91% for US when 
compared to arthroscopic findings. Additionally, US identified the exact location of the injury in 63% of cases 
[15]. Another study comparing US and CT arthrography for the diagnos is of anterior talofibular ligament injury 
showed an accuracy of 61%  using US and 71% for CT arthrography [58]. US also has the dynamic capability of 
stressing the ligament and looking for laxity or frank separation of the injure d ligament  [1,59]. 
With regard to interosseous membrane tears, US has a proven sensitivity of 89% and specificity of  94.5% in 
diagnosing interosseous membrane tears shown at surgery [55, 60]. 
Radiography 
Stress radiograp hs can be used to assess ankle instability  [1,2]; however, some have questioned their accuracy 
[3,4]. One study evaluating anterior talofibular ligament injury demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy of 67% for 
stress radiograph y [15]. Oae et al [15] compared stress radiography to arthroscopic findings and found the former 
has an accuracy of 67% for evaluating anterior talofibular ligament injuries . Subtalar stress radiography using 
forced dorsiflexion and supination [4] or talar rotation  [61] can be us ed to evaluate subt alar laxity.  
CT Arthrography  
CT arthrography showed an accuracy  of 71% for diagnosing anterior talofibular ligament injury [58].  
CT 
CT is not routinely used for the evaluation of ligamentous integrity . 
Arthrography

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 10 Acute Trauma to the Ankle  Rare pantalar dislocations without associated talar or other fracture can be assessed on CT or MRI and have high 
rates of osteonecrosis, osteoarthritis, and infection  [71]. 
MRI Ankle  
MRI is the reference standard for ligamentous injury and assessment of stability , which is particularly important in 
athletes, in whom determination of grade (1, 2,  or 3) of syndesmotic ligament, anterior tibiofibular ligament , and 
deltoid injuries is critica l for treatment planning and return to sport assessment [51] . 
Ligamentous injuries can occur without fracture on radiography. Grossterlinden et al  [52] compared MRI and 
radiography and showed that 15% of ligamentous injuries (including sprains, partial tears, and complete tears) at 
the syndesmosis in acute ankle injuries on M RI demonstra ted no fracture on radiography.  
Rare pantalar dislocations without associated talar or other fracture can be assessed on CT or MRI and have high 
rates of osteonecrosis, osteoarthritis, and infection  [71]. 
Radiography Ankle Stress Views  
Stress radiograph s may be useful in assessing syndesmotic instability, particularly in supination external rotation 
ankle injuries according to the Lauge -Hansen classification. Lee et al [72]  noted that tibiotalar tilt angle and anterior 
tibiofibular space measurements were affected when the anterior tibiofibular and posterior talofibular ligaments 
were injured (confirmed on MRI) in 299 patients . Lateral stress testing with widening of the tibiofibular clear space 
has been shown to be  an indicator of syndesmotic injury , with the traditional external rotation stress test shown to 
be a poor indicator when t he deltoid ligament is injured [73] . 
Radiography Leg 
Maisonneuve fracture (syndesmotic injury of the ankle in combination with a proximal fibular fracture) may be 
overlooked as a result of  lack of pain at the fibula. Careful palpation of the proximal fibula should be performed 
with radiographic evaluation of the entire tibia and fibular if focal tenderness is present [74] . 
US Ankle  
US is not typically the next line of evaluation  of syndesmotic injuries. Although some studies have suggested 
focused US could be beneficial for ligamentous evaluation, others have shown limited utility in lateral ankle 
ligament spr ains [75]. 
Summary of Recommendations  
Variant 1: Ankle radiographs are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of patients 5 years of age or older with 
acute trauma to the ankle or acute trauma to the ankle with persistent pain for more than 1 week but less than 3 
weeks with no exclusionar y criteria present and the OAR  are positive : 1. Inability to bear weight immediately after 
the injury, OR  2. Point tenderness over the medial malleolus, the posterior edge or inferior tip of the lateral 
malleolus, talus, or calcaneus, OR  3. Inability to ambulate for 4 steps in the emergency department.  
Variant 2: Imaging is usually not appropriate for patients 5 years of age or older with a cute trauma to the ankle 
when the patient is able  to walk  and there are no exclusionary criteria present (eg, neurologically intact (includ ing 
no peripheral neuropathy )) and  the OAR  are negative: No point tenderness over the malleoli, talus, or calcaneus on 
physical examination.  
Variant 3: Ankle radiographs are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of patients 5 ye ars of age or older  with 
acute trauma to the ankle when exclusionary criteria are present (eg, neurologic disorder, neuropathy, or other) and 
the patient does not meet requirements for evaluation by the OAR . 
Variant 4: MRI ankle without IV contrast or CT a nkle without IV contrast  are usually appropriate  for patients 5 
years of age or older with acute trauma to the ankle with persistent pain for more than 1 week but less than 3 weeks 
that had negative initial radiographs and no exclusionary criteria are present.

subtalar motion after a period of immobilizat ion [49]. 
CT with IV contrast is not ind icated in this scenario because soft-tissue abnormalities and fluid collections can be 
identified on noncontr ast high -resolution CT studies. 
MRI Ankle  
MRI of the ankle without IV contrast is most sensitive for evaluation of occult fractures with associated bone 
marrow edema patterns, particularly in inversion injuries and persistent lateral ankle pain, as well  as presence and 
extent of soft -tissue injuries  [29]. Stress injuries of bone , including those of the weekend warrior , are best depicted 
by MRI  [50]. 
MRI is the reference standard for ligamentous injury and assessment of stability , which is particularly important in 
athletes, in whom determination of grade ( 1, 2, or 3) of syndesmotic ligament, anterior tibiofibular ligament , and 
deltoid injuries is critical for treatment planning and return to sport assessment [51]. High -resolution evaluation of 
the tendons and ligaments allows distinction between tendinopathy, sprain, and partial or complete tears.  
Ligament and tendon  injuries can occur without fracture on radiography . Gross terlinden et al [52] compared MR I 
and radiography and showed that 15% of ligamentous injuries ( including sprains , partial tears, and complete tears) 
at the syndesmosis in acute ankle injuries on MRI demonstrated no fracture on radiography. Presence o f bone bruise 
and adjacent soft -tissue edema have shown a higher association with acute ligamentous injuries ( anterior talofibular 
ligament most common) and tendon abnormalities [53,54]  in patients with negative radiographs.  MRI can also help 
exclude Salter 1 fractures in the pediatric population [55]. 
Radiography Ankle  
Repeat radiograph s are not typically the next study but may be of use to identify early callous formation at an occult 
fracture line or possible mineralization at a site of intramuscular hematoma if contusion occurred during trauma. 
Radiographs with better technique may assist in diagnosis of subtle injuries such as the lateral talar process avulsion , 
which  may erroneously be diagnosed as  a lateral ankle sprain  [37]. 
Radiography Ankle Stress Views  
Although ankle stress views are not the typical next best study for this patient group, if  there is clinical evidence of 
instability on physician maneuvers, ankle stress views may be of benefit for identification of occult avulsion injury 
at ligamentous attachments that may contribute t o widening of the joint spac e on radiographic stress views.  
US Ankle  
US is not typically  the next imaging study . US may be useful as a secondary evaluation modality for focuse d 
evaluation of underlying soft -tissue injuries  and ligaments, with the added benefit of dynamic imaging. This 
includes f ocused high-resolution US of the peroneal tendons and th e superior peroneal retinaculum  [56], stress US 
(during anterior drawer) to assess joint laxity or chondral avulsion fra ctures associated with lateral ligament injury 
in children with negative radiographs [57,58] , and potential detection of superficial occult fractures at the base of 
the fifth metatarsal, lateral malleolus,  and malleolus [41] . 
Variant  5: Adult or child 5 years of age or older. Acute trauma to the ankle. No exclusionary criteria present. 
Radiographs demonstrate fracture or potential osteochondral injury. Next study.  
Bone Scan Ankle  
Osteochondral lesions  
Bone scan is not the next imaging study in this clinical scenario.  
Fractures  
Bone scan is not the next imaging study in this clinical scenario. Bone scan may be used in rare setting in polytrauma 
cases for evaluation of multiple fractures.

1. Classification: USUALLY APPROPRIATE
2. Explanation: MRI without IV contrast is considered the study of choice for assessment of ligamentous injury and stability, especially in athletes. It is important to determine the grade of syndesmotic ligament, anterior tibiofibular ligament, and deltoid injuries for treatment planning and return to sport assessment. MRI can also help identify bone contusions and associated soft-tissue abnormalities.

Osteoch ondral lesions  
Although MRI is the reference standard, CT is also of utility to identify, locate, and quantify cortical and subcortical 
involvement or loss  as well as presence of intra -articular ossific bodies or associated fractures. In a prospective 
study of 399 patients, uncontained osteochondral lesion of the talus  shoulder , as determined arthroscopically , had a 
more complicated clini cal outcome than those with nonshoulder lesions,  confirming the importance of imaging 
localization for clinical outcome [59]. An inverted osteochondral fracture of the lateral talus (lateral, inverted,

intra-articular extent.  
• Broden view: The Broden view is a supine flexed knee view with 30 ° to 45°  internal rotation that can be used 
for specific improved evaluation of the lateral process fracture of the talus (commonly known as snowboarder’s 
fracture). It may be of use when further evaluation of the fracture is needed.  
• Bicycle spoke injuries in children : These injuries are unusual but can occur with entrapment of the leg in the 
spokes of the bicycle wheel. In a study by Slaar et al [35], if no fracture is noted on ankle radiographs , then  no 
further imaging is warranted . However, if an ankle fracture is present, lower leg imaging may be important to 
assess the distal tibia and fibula but not the foot.  
• Snowboarder’s fracture (lateral talar process or V sign on radiographs) : These fractures may be overlooked 
on routine radiographs between 40% and 50% of the time [36].  Special attention to this area is recommended 
in patients with swelling inferior to the lateral malleolus in t he appropriate clinical setting  to exclude an 
erroneous diagnosis of a lateral ankle sprain  [37]. Lateral inversion stress radiograph s may be useful for full 
evaluation  [38].  
• Anterior talofibular ligament view radiograph: This view may be useful for diagnosis of distal fibular avul sion 
fractures in children with lateral ankle sprain if not seen on traditional 3 -view radiographs . Identification of an 
occult fibular fracture is noted using this view  in 26% of lateral ankle sprain patients [39] . 
• The gravity stress view : This view is more rel iable and easier to perform than  a manual stress view in supination -
external rotation injuries of the ankle with higher suspected incidence of deltoid ligament disruption [40] . 
US Ankle  
Ultrasound (US)  may be useful but is not typically considered the first  line of imaging for the evaluation of acute 
trauma to the ankle with positive OAR [41]. 
Variant 2: Adult or child 5 years of age or older. Acute trauma to the ankle. No exclusionary criteria present 
(eg, neurologically intact (including no peripheral neuropathy )). Patient meets the requirements for 
evaluation by the Ottawa Ankle Rules which are negative: No point tenderness over the malleoli, talus, or 
calcaneus on physical examination. Able to walk. Initial imaging.  
Bone Scan Ankle  
Bone scan is not routinely indicated as the first imaging study for evaluation of acute trauma to the ankle in this 
clinical scenario.  
CT Ankle  
CT is not routinely indicated as the first imaging study for evaluation of acute trauma to the ankl e in this clinical 
scenario . 
MRI Ankle  
MRI is not routinely indicated as the first imaging study for evaluation of acute trauma to the ankle in this clinical 
scenario.  
Radiography Ankle  
Radiography is not routinely indicated as the first imaging study for evaluation of acute trauma to the ankle in this

OAR should not be used in patients with neurologic abnormality involving the lower leg or those with decreased 
sensation ( eg, diabetics), altered sensorium, or inability to communicate [25,26] . Other possible cautionary or 
exclusionary scenarios include pregnancy, penetrating trauma, or presence of prior recent outside radiographs on 
transfer.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 10 Acute Trauma to the Ankle  Rare pantalar dislocations without associated talar or other fracture can be assessed on CT or MRI and have high 
rates of osteonecrosis, osteoarthritis, and infection  [71]. 
MRI Ankle  
MRI is the reference standard for ligamentous injury and assessment of stability , which is particularly important in 
athletes, in whom determination of grade (1, 2,  or 3) of syndesmotic ligament, anterior tibiofibular ligament , and 
deltoid injuries is critica l for treatment planning and return to sport assessment [51] . 
Ligamentous injuries can occur without fracture on radiography. Grossterlinden et al  [52] compared MRI and 
radiography and showed that 15% of ligamentous injuries (including sprains, partial tears, and complete tears) at 
the syndesmosis in acute ankle injuries on M RI demonstra ted no fracture on radiography.  
Rare pantalar dislocations without associated talar or other fracture can be assessed on CT or MRI and have high 
rates of osteonecrosis, osteoarthritis, and infection  [71]. 
Radiography Ankle Stress Views  
Stress radiograph s may be useful in assessing syndesmotic instability, particularly in supination external rotation 
ankle injuries according to the Lauge -Hansen classification. Lee et al [72]  noted that tibiotalar tilt angle and anterior 
tibiofibular space measurements were affected when the anterior tibiofibular and posterior talofibular ligaments 
were injured (confirmed on MRI) in 299 patients . Lateral stress testing with widening of the tibiofibular clear space 
has been shown to be  an indicator of syndesmotic injury , with the traditional external rotation stress test shown to 
be a poor indicator when t he deltoid ligament is injured [73] . 
Radiography Leg 
Maisonneuve fracture (syndesmotic injury of the ankle in combination with a proximal fibular fracture) may be 
overlooked as a result of  lack of pain at the fibula. Careful palpation of the proximal fibula should be performed 
with radiographic evaluation of the entire tibia and fibular if focal tenderness is present [74] . 
US Ankle  
US is not typically the next line of evaluation  of syndesmotic injuries. Although some studies have suggested 
focused US could be beneficial for ligamentous evaluation, others have shown limited utility in lateral ankle 
ligament spr ains [75]. 
Summary of Recommendations  
Variant 1: Ankle radiographs are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of patients 5 years of age or older with 
acute trauma to the ankle or acute trauma to the ankle with persistent pain for more than 1 week but less than 3 
weeks with no exclusionar y criteria present and the OAR  are positive : 1. Inability to bear weight immediately after 
the injury, OR  2. Point tenderness over the medial malleolus, the posterior edge or inferior tip of the lateral 
malleolus, talus, or calcaneus, OR  3. Inability to ambulate for 4 steps in the emergency department.  
Variant 2: Imaging is usually not appropriate for patients 5 years of age or older with a cute trauma to the ankle 
when the patient is able  to walk  and there are no exclusionary criteria present (eg, neurologically intact (includ ing 
no peripheral neuropathy )) and  the OAR  are negative: No point tenderness over the malleoli, talus, or calcaneus on 
physical examination.  
Variant 3: Ankle radiographs are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of patients 5 ye ars of age or older  with 
acute trauma to the ankle when exclusionary criteria are present (eg, neurologic disorder, neuropathy, or other) and 
the patient does not meet requirements for evaluation by the OAR . 
Variant 4: MRI ankle without IV contrast or CT a nkle without IV contrast  are usually appropriate  for patients 5 
years of age or older with acute trauma to the ankle with persistent pain for more than 1 week but less than 3 weeks 
that had negative initial radiographs and no exclusionary criteria are present.

subtalar motion after a period of immobilizat ion [49]. 
CT with IV contrast is not ind icated in this scenario because soft-tissue abnormalities and fluid collections can be 
identified on noncontr ast high -resolution CT studies. 
MRI Ankle  
MRI of the ankle without IV contrast is most sensitive for evaluation of occult fractures with associated bone 
marrow edema patterns, particularly in inversion injuries and persistent lateral ankle pain, as well  as presence and 
extent of soft -tissue injuries  [29]. Stress injuries of bone , including those of the weekend warrior , are best depicted 
by MRI  [50]. 
MRI is the reference standard for ligamentous injury and assessment of stability , which is particularly important in 
athletes, in whom determination of grade ( 1, 2, or 3) of syndesmotic ligament, anterior tibiofibular ligament , and 
deltoid injuries is critical for treatment planning and return to sport assessment [51]. High -resolution evaluation of 
the tendons and ligaments allows distinction between tendinopathy, sprain, and partial or complete tears.  
Ligament and tendon  injuries can occur without fracture on radiography . Gross terlinden et al [52] compared MR I 
and radiography and showed that 15% of ligamentous injuries ( including sprains , partial tears, and complete tears) 
at the syndesmosis in acute ankle injuries on MRI demonstrated no fracture on radiography. Presence o f bone bruise 
and adjacent soft -tissue edema have shown a higher association with acute ligamentous injuries ( anterior talofibular 
ligament most common) and tendon abnormalities [53,54]  in patients with negative radiographs.  MRI can also help 
exclude Salter 1 fractures in the pediatric population [55]. 
Radiography Ankle  
Repeat radiograph s are not typically the next study but may be of use to identify early callous formation at an occult 
fracture line or possible mineralization at a site of intramuscular hematoma if contusion occurred during trauma. 
Radiographs with better technique may assist in diagnosis of subtle injuries such as the lateral talar process avulsion , 
which  may erroneously be diagnosed as  a lateral ankle sprain  [37]. 
Radiography Ankle Stress Views  
Although ankle stress views are not the typical next best study for this patient group, if  there is clinical evidence of 
instability on physician maneuvers, ankle stress views may be of benefit for identification of occult avulsion injury 
at ligamentous attachments that may contribute t o widening of the joint spac e on radiographic stress views.  
US Ankle  
US is not typically  the next imaging study . US may be useful as a secondary evaluation modality for focuse d 
evaluation of underlying soft -tissue injuries  and ligaments, with the added benefit of dynamic imaging. This 
includes f ocused high-resolution US of the peroneal tendons and th e superior peroneal retinaculum  [56], stress US 
(during anterior drawer) to assess joint laxity or chondral avulsion fra ctures associated with lateral ligament injury 
in children with negative radiographs [57,58] , and potential detection of superficial occult fractures at the base of 
the fifth metatarsal, lateral malleolus,  and malleolus [41] . 
Variant  5: Adult or child 5 years of age or older. Acute trauma to the ankle. No exclusionary criteria present. 
Radiographs demonstrate fracture or potential osteochondral injury. Next study.  
Bone Scan Ankle  
Osteochondral lesions  
Bone scan is not the next imaging study in this clinical scenario.  
Fractures  
Bone scan is not the next imaging study in this clinical scenario. Bone scan may be used in rare setting in polytrauma 
cases for evaluation of multiple fractures.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 9 Acute Trauma to the Ankle  fracture talus, also known as the  LIFT lesion) can occur after twisting injury to the ankle.  Initial radiographs should 
be followed by CT  and MR I [60,61] . These lesions are treated successfully with combined open approach and 
arthroscop y. 
Fractures  
CT is the first -line imaging  study  after radiographs to determine extent, displacement , comminution, intra -articular 
extension , associated injuries,  and potential classification of fractures [48] . This is particularly important in subtalar, 
calcaneal,  and talar fractures because of  the complex anatomy and in high -impact polytrauma or complex 
comminuted injuries in which multiplanar CT imaging is recommended to help direct the preoperative planning 
evaluation process [62]. 
MRI Ankle  
Osteochondral lesions  
MRI without  IV contrast is co nsidered the study of choice for assessment of cartilage abnormalities and bone 
contusions related to acquired  osteochondral lesion,  particularly in patients with symptoms of persistent pain, 
stiffness, locking, clicking , and ankle swelling  [22,55-57,63] . Although radiographs and CT depict ossific fragments 
and fracture lines, cartilage abnormalities and bone contusions related to osteochondral lesion are best seen on MRI. 
Seventy percent  of ankle fractures and 50% of ankle sprains have been shown to result in some variation of cartilage 
injury [57,58,61,64] . 
Fractures  
Although CT is more commonly used as the next step in fracture assessment in  known fractures, MRI can be useful 
as a follow-up imaging modality for assessment of associated bone marrow contusions, stress injuries,  or fractures 
[65]. MRI is especially important in fracture sites such as the talus,  which are at higher risk for osteonecrosis. MR I 
is highly accurate for associated soft -tissue abnormalities including tendon entrapment/dislocation and for 
ligamentous inju ries [66]. 
Radiography Ankle Broden’s View  
The Broden view is a supine  flexed knee view with 30 ° to 45° internal rotation that  can be used  for specific improved 
evaluation of the lateral process fracture of the talus (commonly known as snowboarder’s fracture). It may be of 
use when further evaluation of the talar fracture is needed.  
US Ankle  
Osteochondra l lesion  
US is not the next step in this clinical scenario.  
Fractures  
US has been shown to be useful for identification of lateral malleolar, medial malleolar , and fifth metatarsal 
fractures [41] but is not conside red a first -line assessment tool  or next imaging study  in this clinical scenario.  
Variant 6 : Adult or child 5 years of age or older. Acute trauma to the ankle. Radiographs negative for osseous 
injury and physical examination or radiographs demonstrate alignment abnormality  suggesting 
syndesmotic/ligamentous injury or dislocation. Next study. 
Lateral sprain is more common than medial strain , with the anterior talofibular ligament most commonly tor n. High 
sprain and fractures are more common in high -collision sport injuries [60], with higher incidence of ankle injuries 
during winter months [67] and increased incidence in military recruits [68]. Inversion injuries of the ankle account 
for 25% of musculoskeletal system injuries and 50% of all sports -related injuries [1].  
Bone Scan Ankle  
Bone scan is not routinely the next line of imaging in this clinical scenario.  
CT Ankle  
CT is useful for evaluation of dislocation and can be used to detect  syndesmotic injuries, although MRI is better for 
soft-tissue evaluation. Nault et al [69]  validated CT scan measurement s that  can identify syndesmotic injuries seen 
on MRI (retrosp ective study of MRI and CT) as a result of  modification of distal tibiofibular relationship after a 
mild syndesmotic injury.",True

2. Analysis of appropriate imaging recommendations:
- According to the ACR Appropriateness Criteria, initial imaging for acute trauma to the foot is usually done with radiography (X-rays).
- MRI is not routinely used as the first imaging study for the evaluation of acute trauma to the foot with positive Ottawa rules.
- MRI is the most sensitive modality for the detection of occult fracture and acute bone stress changes, but it is not routinely used as the first imaging study for acute trauma to the foot.

3. Recommendation:

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 5 Acute Trauma to the Foot  US Foot  
A preliminary  US study  had less successful  results compared  with radiographic  evaluation,  with 90.9%  sensitivity  
and specificity  for detecting  fracture  [13]. In the presence of localized  tenderness,  one study  report ed US 
sensitivity  and specificity  of 100%  and 96% for fifth metatarsal  fractures and 40% and 93% for navicular  
fractures,  respectively  [23].  A recent  consensus  paper  from  European Society  of Musculoskeletal  Radiology  [14] 
assigned low grading scores for US assessment  of talus  and bony  avulsions.  
Variant  3: Adult  or child older  than  5 years of age. Acute trauma  to the foot.  Ottawa  rules cannot  be 
evaluated  due to exclusionary  criteria.  Initial imaging.  
Multiple  conditions  or scenarios preclude  the use of the Ottawa rules for determining  if imaging  is necessary  
[5,6] . It has been  reported  that the Ottawa rules  for the foot should not be used or should be used with great  
caution  in the following  clinical  situations:  penetrating  trauma,  pregnancy,  any skin wound,  transferred  with 
radiographs  already  taken,  >10 days after trauma,  a return  visit for continued  traumatic  foot pain,  in the setting  of 
polytrauma,  altered  sensorium,  neurologic  abnormality  affecting  the foot, or underlying  bone  disease [7]. 
Radiograph y Foot  
If a foot fracture is suspected  in a neurologically  compromised  patient, including patients  with diabetic  
neuropathy , the foot should  be radiographed.  The Ottawa rules  should  not be applied  in this clinical  setting  
because pain perception  may be diminished,  no point  tenderness will be elicited  with palpation,  and the patient  
may be able to ambulate  even  if a fracture is present  [5]. Polytrauma  and penetrating  trauma  also constitute  
exceptions  to the implementations  of the Ottawa rules . 
Both  radiographs  and US are useful  imaging tools  to exclude  a foreign  body in the setting  of penetrating  trauma  to 
the foot [24]. The best initial imaging study  for a foreign  body in the foot depends  on whether  or not the suspected  
foreign  body is radiopaque  (eg, gravel,  both leaded  and nonleaded  glass,  or metal).  Radiographic  evaluation  for a 
radiopaque  foreign body has approximately  98% sensitivity  [25]. If an unembedded fragment  of the foreign  body 
is available,  then imaging  it alongside  the foot might  provide  more  information  as to the morphology and density  
of the foreign  body.  
CT Foot  
CT is commonly used in evaluating  the true extent  of osseous injury  in complex fractures and at times  is used as 
the initial imaging  study  in polytrauma  patients  and in complex  regions  such as the midfoot  [21,22] . In the 
polytrauma  patient, approximately  25% of midfoot  fractures identified  on CT are overlooked on radiographs  [21].  
Therefore,  CT is essential  for appropriate  treatment  planning and determining  the true extent  of osseous injuries  in 
the polytrauma  patient  and can be used as primary  imaging  technique  in high-energy  polytrauma  patients.  
Initial clinical  experience suggests that cone -beam  CT of the foot or ankle  of pediatric  patients  is a viable  lower -
dose alternative  to multidetector  CT [26]. 
MRI Foot  
MRI is not routinely  used as the first imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the foot in the setting  of 
peripheral  neuropathy,  penetrating  trauma , or polytrauma .

Guideline: ACR acute trauma to foot.pdf, Page: 4
Page Content: Radiography Foot  with  Weightbearing  
If there are clinical  signs  of a Lisfranc  injury , obtaining  weight bearing  radiographs  is recommended  when  
possible  because nonweightbearing  radiographs  are not reliable  for detection  of subtle  injuries.  Weightbearing  
views have  been  shown  to increase the abnormal  alignment  at the Lisfranc joint, thus making it easier  to identify  a 
Lisfranc injury  [16,19] . The inclusion  of both feet on AP radiographs  can help in the detection  of subtle  
malalignment  when  compared  with the uninjured side [20]. 
CT Foot  
CT is commonly used in evaluating  the true extent  of osseous injury  in complex fractures and at times  is used as 
the initial imaging  study  in polytrauma  patients  and in complex  regions  such as the midfoot  [21,22] . CT is not 
routinely  used as the first imaging study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the foot with positive  Ottawa rules

Metatarsal -Phalangeal  Joint Injury  
The best initial imaging study  for evaluating  hallux  plantar  plate  disruption  after metatarsal -phalangeal  (MTP)  
joint injury  is weightbearing  AP, lateral,  and sesamoid  axial  views,  with addition  of comparison  radiographs  of 
the contralateral  foot [29].  Radiographs  may also indirectly  evaluate lesser  metatarsophalangeal  plantar  plate  
injury  [30]. The combination  of a positive  drawer  test coupled with transverse deviation  of the third  MTP  joint on 
radiographs  can be used to diagnose  high-grade  plantar  plate  tear of the second  MTP joint [31]. 
A forced  dorsiflexion lateral  view of the hallux  MTP  joint is recommended  if there is clinical  suspicion  of plantar  
plate  injury  of the first MTP joint [29]. 
Radiography Foot  with  Weightbearing  
The best initial imaging study  for evaluating  hallux  plantar  plate  disruption after MTP joint injury  is 
weightbearing  AP, lateral,  and sesamoid  axial  views  with addition  of comparison radiographs  of the contralateral  
foot [29,32] . 
CT Foot  
Studies  report  moderate to poor sensitivity  (25%–33%)  of radiographs  in detection  of midfoot  fractures [21] in 
Level  1 trauma  patients.  A study of 49 patients  with acute hyperflexion injuries  to the foot concluded that 
conventional  radiographs  including  weightbearing  images are not sufficient  for routine  diagnostic  workup and CT 
should serve as the primary  imaging  technique  for such patients  [33]. 
MRI Foot  
MRI is the most  sensitive modality  for the detection  of occult  fracture  and acute bone  stress changes [34,35] . MRI  
is not routinely  used as the first imaging study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the foot in setting  of suspected  
MTP joint injury  or occult  fracture.  Both  MRI and US are used in evaluating  soft-tissue injuries  of the foot in the 
setting  of acute trauma,  especially  when  radiographs  are noncontributory.  Both  modalities  have  a similar  
sensitivity  for acute soft-tissue  trauma  about  the ankle  and foot such as ligamentous  and tendinous  disruption [36-
38]. 
US Foot  
US is not routinely  used as the first imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the foot in the setting  of 
suspected  MTP joint injury  or occult  fracture.  US has been  shown  to be sensitive for the diagnosis  of acute tendon  
rupture  or tendon dislocation  in the foot [36,39,40] . 
Fluoroscopy  Foot  
In addition  to routine  radiographs , fluoroscopy  has been  suggested  in assessment  of a hallux  MTP joint injury  
with direct  fluoroscopic  evaluation  of sesamoid  tracking  distally  with great  toe extension  at the MTP joint on 
forced  dorsiflexion lateral  view or fluoroscopy  [29]. 
Variant  5: Adult  or child older  than  5 years of age. Acute trauma  to the foot.  Suspect  Lisfranc injury, 
tendon injury, or occult  fracture or dislocation. Radiographs  are normal  or equivocal. Next  imaging  study. 
CT Foot  
Lisfranc  Injury  
CT has been  advocated  as the primary  imaging  technique  in acute hyperflexion  injury  and high-energy  
polytrauma  (especially  if the patient is not able to bear weight)  [33,38,41- 45].

Guideline: ACR acute trauma to foot.pdf, Page: 7
Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 7 Acute Trauma to the Foot  injuries  in midtarsal  (Chopart) sprains,  which  frequently  accompany  acute ankle  injuries  [52,53] . If radiographs  
are negative,  MRI can be obtained in select  patients  with forefoot  pain because of its increased  sensitivity  for the 
early  detection  of metatarsal  head  subchondral  fracture  [54]. 
Lisfranc  Injury  
MRI has been  advocated  as a sensitive diagnostic  test in evaluation  of Lisfranc ligamentous  complex  (especially  
if the patient  is not able to bear weight),  and 3-D volumetric  acquisitions  have  proven superiority  over orthogonal  
proton  density  fat-suppressed  imaging [33,38,41- 45]. There is a high correlation  between  MRI and intraoperative  
findings  for an unstable  Lisfranc injury  [44]. In the patient  with a suspected  Lisfranc injury  and normal  
radiographs,  the literature  supports  further advanced  imaging  by MRI  and CT [21,33,43,46] . 
Turf Toe and Plantar  Plate Injuries 
MRI is the preferred  imaging method for evaluating  suspected  “turf  toe” and lesser  metatarsal  plantar  plate  injury  
by directly  evaluating  the soft-tissue structures of the capsuloligamentous  complex  as well as assessing  chondral  
and osteochondral  lesions [29,55,56] . 
Acute  Tendinous  Rupture  
MRI tends  to be used as a screening  tool when  one is not certain  of the specific tendon injury  or if concomitant  
osseous injury  is suspected.  Both  MRI and US have  been  shown  to be sensitive  for the diagnosis  of acute tendon  
rupture  or dislocation  in the foot [39]. In a surgically  confirmed  study,  MRI was shown  to have  83% sensitivity  
for diagnosing tendon and ligament  traumatic  injuries  about  the foot and ankle  [37]. 
US Foot  
The importance  of focused  US examinations  is emphasized  in the literature  [57,58] . Protocol -based  US evaluation  
identified  97.4%  of symptomatic abnormalities  in the distal  extremities  (including the foot),  with additional  
accuracy  obtained  with focused  examination  [57]. 
Lisfranc  Injury  
Although  the literature  evidence is limited, US may hold promise  as an alternative method to accurately  evaluate 
for a significant  Lisfranc injury  providing direct  and indirect  assessment  of the Lisfranc ligamentous  complex  as 
well as dynamic  evaluation  with weightbearing  as demonstrated  in a series of 10 patients  [59].  Dorsal  component  
of Lisfranc ligament  is amenable to direct  US evaluation  [59,60] , although this structure may not be critical  for 
stability  for the Lisfranc joint [20,32] . The physiologic  deformation of the dorsal  Lisfranc ligament  resulting  from  
functional  loading emphasized  the need  for normative  US data as well as proper  positioning  when  bilateral  
evaluation  is performed  [61,62] .

US in the sagittal  plane  best visualizes  the plantar  plate  between  the flexor  tendon and hyaline  cartilage of the 
metatarsal  head  [63]. US has shown  a 96% sensitivity  compared  with 87% sensitivity  for MRI  for the detection  of 
lesser  toe plantar  plate  tears;  however , both modalities  have  poor specificity  [64].  
Acute  Tendinous  Rupture  
Both  MRI and US have  been  shown  to be sensitive for the diagnosis  of acute tendon  rupture  or dislocation  in the 
foot [39].

2. Analysis of appropriate imaging recommendations:
Based on the context information, MRI is an accurate method used in the evaluation of soft-tissue, osseous, and neural injuries after knee dislocation. MRI can diagnose the patterns and severity of bone marrow contusions that frequently have an association with the specific mechanisms of injury and can predict associated soft-tissue injuries.

3. Recommendation:
Classification: USUALLY APPROPRIATE
Explanation: MRI of the left knee is usually appropriate for the evaluation of soft-tissue, osseous, and neural injuries after knee dislocation. It can provide detailed information about any bony or soft tissue injury in the knee.

Summary  of Recommendations 
• Variant  1: Knee radiographs  may be appropriate  for the initial imaging  of patients  5 years of age or older  for 
the evaluation  of a fall or acute twisting  trauma  to the knee  when  there is no focal  tenderness,  no effusion,  and 
they are able to walk .

Guideline: ACR acute trauma to knee.pdf, Page: 8
Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 8 Acute  Trauma  to the Knee  Variant  3: Adult  or skeletally  mature  child.  Fall or acute twisting  trauma  to the knee.  No fracture  seen on 
radiographs.  Suspect  occult  fracture or internal derangement.  Next  study. 
CT Knee  
CT may be performed  as the next imaging  study  for the evaluation  of suspected  radiographically occult  knee  
fractures.  
Several  studies reported  CT to be superior  to knee  radiographs  in detection  and classification  of fractures.  In a study 
by Mustonen  et al [12],  CT showed  100%  and radiographs  83% sensitivity  in detection  of tibial plateau fractures , 
and CT was superior  in further  characterization  of fracture  severity . 
In the setting  of acute knee  trauma,  Mui et al [13] reported  80% sensitivity  and 98% specificity  of the CT 
examination  in detecting  bony  avulsion  fractures and a high negative  predictive  value  for excluding  ligamentous  
injuries , but MRI remained  necessary  for the preoperative  detection  of meniscal  injury . 
Peltola  et al [14] compared  dual-energy  CT examinations  with MRI  studies as a reference standard  in 18 patients  
with acute knee  trauma  and reported  dual-energy  CT had 79% sensitivity  and 100%  specificity  in detecting  anterior  
cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures  [14]. 
In a study  by Heffernan  et al [15], 64-channel  multidetector  CT showed  87.5% to 100%  sensitivity  and 100%  
specificity  for detection  of the ACL  tears.  As on MRI,  secondary  signs,  such as buckling  of the posterior  cruciate 
ligament , were also useful  in their diagnosis.  In this study , multidetector  CT showed a low sensitivity  for other  soft-
tissue injuries  at the knee;  however,  its high specificity  indicated  that apparent  posterior  cruciate  ligament , meniscal,  
and collateral  ligament  tears can reliably  be treated  as true-positive  findings  [15]. 
The dual-energy  CT virtual  noncalcium  technique  can subtract  calcium  from  cancellous bone,  allowing  detection  
[16-18] and possibly grading of the post-traumatic  bone  marrow  contusions  [18]. 
However,  MRI is superior  to CT in detection  of bone  marrow  abnormalities  and meniscal  and ligamentous  injuries  
and may be subsequently  performed  as clinically  indicated. 
MR Arth rography  Knee  
With  negative radiographs,  MR arthrography  is not routinely  used as the next imaging study  for the evaluation  of 
suspected  occult  knee  fractures or internal  derangement . 
MRA Knee  
With  negative radiographs,  MRA  is not routinely  used as the next imaging study  for the evaluation  of suspected  
occult  knee  fractures or internal  derangement . 
MRI Knee  
MRI has many  distinct advantages for the evaluation  of the injured  knee  in the setting  of negative  radiographs.  
The majority  of patients  (93.5%)  who present  with acute  knee  injuries  in the emergency  department  sustained  soft-
tissue injuries  rather  than osseous injuries  [19].  MRI  is a proven valuable  tool in the treatment  decision -making  
process,  allowing  earlier  surgical  intervention  by obtaining  a more  accurate diagnosis  [20,21] . Frobell et al [22] 
reported  a low diagnostic  benefit  of the initial clinical  examination  in the setting  of acute knee  trauma  with higher -
than-suspected  incidence of the ACL  injuries  on MRI.

painful or asymptomatic knee not significantly different in patients 45 to 55 years of age [20,21]. 
Bone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the 
subchondral bone.  New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or 
patients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee 
pain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the 
origin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. 
Subchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed 
spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to 
elderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs 
often initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, 
and progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is 
suspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria
® 
topic on “ Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae ” [28]. 
Some patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using 
quantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs 
exhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ]. 
Patellofemoral car tilage loss is also associated with chronic knee pain , with active knee pain correlated with 
BMLs [30,31]. Similar to CT, MRI can calculate various anatomic measurements associated with patellofemoral 
subluxation/dislocation and lateral patellofemoral friction syndrome [32-34]. Bone marrow edema in the classic 
location for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also 
differentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise 
therapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. 
Other etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat 
pad impingement syndromes, Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome, adhesive 
capsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes , 
and osteonecrosis [15, 19,36-45].  
MRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a 
joint effusion. However, contrast -enhanced images ma y be more accurate in diagnosing other causes of chronic 
knee pain , such as Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome, and adhesive 
capsulitis [15].  In particular, enh ancing synovitis thicker than 2 mm in Hoffa’s fat is correlated with peripatellar 
pain [46]. Contrast -enhanced MRI is also useful in quantifying the degree of synovitis and in evaluating 
conditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis [ 17,42,47,48].  
MR Arthrography  Knee  
MR arthrography performed with an intra -articular injection of dilute gadolinium solution is typically not 
indicated as a second exam ination  but rather reserved for patients with known prior meniscal surgery, chondral 
and osteochondral lesions , and suspected loose bodies  [10].

Arteriography  Lower Extremity  
Vascular  injury  may be found in about  30% of patients  following  posterior  knee  dislocation  [56]. Injuries  of the 
popliteal artery  require  prompt  surgical  intervention to help limb preservation . Associated  peroneal  and tibial nerve  
injuries  may cause significant  morbidity and require  an understanding of their pathophysiologic  implications  to 
maximize  limb functionality  [57]. Angiography  has been  the reference standard  in the evaluation  of vascular  injuries  
associated  with knee  dislocations  [58]. However,  this is an invasive  procedure  with associated  risk, and with the 
excellent  performance of CTA and MRA, it is usually  performed  in selected  cases  [58]. 
CT Knee  
CT is not routinely  used as the initial imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the knee.  CT is superior  
to knee  radiographs  in detection  and classification  of fractures [12]; however,  without  IV contrast , CT cannot  detect  
vascular  injuries. 
CTA Lower Extremity  
With  suspected  vascular  injuries  in the setting  of knee  dislocation, CTA  is frequently  used because it is less invasive  
and has a similar ly high accuracy  as conventional  angiography [58-60]. 
MR Arthrography  Knee  
In patients  with significant  acute knee  trauma  with suspected  or possible  dislocation , MR arthrography  of the knee 
is not routinely used as the initial imaging  study.  
MRA Knee  
MRI is an accurate method used in the evaluation  of soft-tissue,  osseous,  and neural  injuries  after knee  dislocation  
[61]. MRA  may be performed  simultaneously  with MRI  for evaluation  of internal  derangement  and vascular  injuries  
with less morbidity  compared  with conventional  angiography  [62]. Potter  et al [61] reported  their experience with 
popliteal fossa MRA  with encouraging  results and complete agreement  between  the MRA  and conventional  
angiography in patients  who had both studies.  Similarly, in a study  by Tocci  et al [62], MRA  has been  shown  to be 
as accurate and useful  as conventional  angiography in the evaluation  of popliteal  artery  injuries  of patients  with 
knee  dislocations.  
MRI Knee  
With  its superb  contrast  resolution  and multiplanar  imaging capability , MRI is proven to be a highly  accurate  
imaging modality  in the evaluation  of bone  marrow  contusions  and occult  fractures [27-29] as well as meniscal  
[21,26]  and ligamentous  injuries  [21,31,32] . It can be performed  in conjunction  with MRA  for evaluation  of internal  
derangement  and vascular  injuries  with less morbidity  compared  with conventional  angiography [62]. 
Radiography Knee  
In the setting  of significant  acute trauma  to the knee , radiographs  should  be the first imaging study.

A retrospective study  by Cecava et al [25] showed  that knee  radiography  is a highly specific screening  test for 
internal  derangement  in patients  <40 years old with acute knee injury.  In this patient population,  knee  effusion  >10 
mm on lateral  radiograph  should prompt  consideration  for the knee  MRI examination , which  can potentially  
decrease delayed  diagnosis,  improve  patient  outcomes,  and decrease  disability  [25].

Summary of Literature Review  
Background/Introduction 
Chronic knee pain affects tens of millions of people  in the United States annually , with the pain sometimes highly 
disabling and often negatively impacting the patient’s quality of life. Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and 
it can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain 
with the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. 
Typically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain 
persists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  
imaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated 
that approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the 
prior year) radiographs [2 ]. 
This document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  ≥5 years of age.  The 
variants discussed include: (1) initial exam ination ; (2) initial radiograph is normal or demonstrates a joint 
effusion; (3) initial radiogr aph demonstrates osteochondritis dissecans (OCD), loose bodies or history of cartilage,  
or meniscal repair; (4) initial radiograph demonstrates osteoarthritis or chondrocalcinosis; and (5)  initial 
radiograph demonstrates signs of prior (chronic) knee injur y (ie, Segond fract ure, tibial spine avulsion, etc ).  
To evaluat e knee pain associated with other conditions, please refer to the following ACR Appropriateness 
Criteria® topic on:  “Osteonecrosi s of the Hip ” [3] for osteonecrosis,  “Acute Trauma to the Knee ” for acute knee 
injuries  [4], “Imaging After Total Knee Arthroplasty ” for patients with total knee arthroplasty  [5], “Soft-Tissue 
Masses ” for a patient with a suspected soft -tissue mass [6], “Primary Bone Tumors ” for a patient with a suspected 
or known bone tumor [ 7], and “ Chronic Extremity Joint Pain -Suspected Inflammatory Arthritis ” for patient with 
suspected arthritis  or synovitis [ 8]. 
Special Imaging  Considerations  
Knee radiographs  should include at least one frontal projection of one or both knees (anteroposterior, Rosenberg, 
or tunnel), a tangential patellar view , and a lateral view of the affected knee [2,9]. Standing radiographs more 
accurately reflect medial and lateral compartment cartilage loss than supine radiographs with the posteromedial and posterolateral joint compartments  more accurately assessed using a weight -bearing flexion posteroanterior 
radiograph [9,10].

quantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs 
exhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ].

Guideline: ACR chronic knee pain.pdf, Page: 8
Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 8 Chronic Knee Pain  CT Knee  
Dual -energy CT without  IV contrast may be indicated if gout  or mixed crystal disease is a consideration.  
Otherwise, CT i s not commonly used as a diagnostic test to evaluate patients with osteoarthritis or 
chondrocalcinosis.  Limited CT without IV contrast can be used for surgical planning.  
CT Arthrography  Knee  
CT arthrography is not commonly utilized as a second test in pati ents with arthritis even though CT is the most 
accurate method for evaluating cartilage abnormalities extending to the articular surface that is  due to the high 
spatial resolution between the contrast and the cartilage [11].  
MRI Knee  
MRI without IV contrast is not usually indicated in patients for whom radiographs are diagnostic of osteoarthritis 
unless symptoms are not explained by the radiographic findings (eg, s tress fractures) or the appropriate treatment 
option requires additional imaging [11, 19]. 
Given the increased sensitivity of MRI for osteoarthritis, MRI may be indicated when more accurate or serial 
cartilage measurements are desired [10 ,55,56]. In patients >70 years of age, a higher correlation with the 
“abnormal” knee being painful is present when structural abnormalities are unilateral on either radiographs or 
MRI. S ince bilateral structural abnormalities can be present with primarily unilateral symptoms, the ability to 
discriminate painful from nonpainful knees is limited [57] . This persists even when using the MRI presence of 
synovitis or effusion and/or a Kellgren and Lawrence score of ≥ 2; findings were reported to be the best 
discriminators between painful and asymptomatic knees [19].  
Patellofemoral cartilage loss is closely associated with chronic knee pain with active knee pain correlated with BMLs [56]. Since MRI is more accurate than physical examination in identifying severe grades of 
chondromalacia patellae, it may be an appropriate screening tool prior to arthroscopy [58 ]. 
MRI with and without IV contrast is indicated when performing semiquantitative assessment of knee 
osteoarthritis using various scoring systems to include cartilage, synovitis, ligaments, BMLs , and menisci [18].  In 
obese patients with osteoarthritis on contrast -enhanced images, increased perfusion in Hoffa’s fat is associated 
with more severe anterior knee pain [59 ].  
MR Arthrography  Knee  
MR arthrography is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with osteoarthritis or chondrocalcinosis.  
US Knee  
US is not often useful as a screening test or a comprehensive examination.  US can detect synovial pathology, 
effusions , and cortical erosive changes [11]. Power Doppler US  can demonstrate increased synovial blood flow 
that is associated with knee pain and can demonstrat e reduced blood flow , which correlates with reduced knee 
pain following joint injections [60]. US can also demonstrate meniscal extrusion , a finding th at suggests an 
underlying meniscal tear , and , on occasion , chondrocalcinosis and peripheral meniscal tears [11].  
Bone Scan Knee  
Radionuclide bone scan  is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with chronic knee pain given the low 
specificity and decreased anatomic resolution compared to CT or MRI [11].  However, i t may help distinguish 
between bone and soft -tissue origins for pain as well as localize pain to one or more joints [11].  
Image -Guided Aspiration Knee  
If an effusion is present, US - or fluoroscopically guided joint aspiration can be performed for synovial fluid 
analysis if there is concern for crystal disease or infection.  Corticosteroid injections can also be performed as they 
may result in a 1  to 2 week reduction in synovitis on MR I in two -thirds of patients. MRI also demonstrates a 
subsequent increase in the synovial volume in approximately 70% of patients that develop recurrent pain [61 ].

He felt a pop sensation and has swelling, effusion, and tenderness on examination. X-rays did not show any fracture or dislocation. An MRI without IV contrast is ordered to assess for ligamentous and meniscal injury. MRI is an accurate method for evaluating soft-tissue, osseous, and neural injuries after knee trauma, and it is commonly used in cases like this to assess ligamentous and meniscal injuries.

Page Content: US is an excellent  imaging  modality  for the diagnosis  of quadriceps tendon tears 
[42] with good performance  in the evaluation  of the meniscal  [44-46] and ligamentous  [47-49] injuries. However,

CT Knee  
In patients  with radiographic  diagnosis  of the tibial plateau  fracture,  CT is frequently  performed  for further  
classification  and characterization  of the fracture  severity  [12,52]  and may predict  or diagnose  ligamentous  injuries  
[13-15,50,51]  and predict  meniscal  injuries  [15,50] . A study by Spiro  et al [50] found  that the amount  of articular  
surface depression  on CT is a predictor  of meniscal  and ligamentous  injuries  and can suggest  when  an MRI is 
indicated  to confirm  or exclude  meniscal  and ligamentous  injuries  [50]. In a study  by Mustonen et al [12], CT 
showed  100%  sensitivity  and radiographs  83% sensitivity  in detection  of tibial plateau  fractures , and CT was 
superior  in further  characteri zation  of fracture  severity . Chang  et al [52] reported  that CT-reconstructed  images

A retrospective study  by Cecava et al [25] showed  that knee  radiography  is a highly specific screening  test for 
internal  derangement  in patients  <40 years old with acute knee injury.  In this patient population,  knee  effusion  >10 
mm on lateral  radiograph  should prompt  consideration  for the knee  MRI examination , which  can potentially  
decrease delayed  diagnosis,  improve  patient  outcomes,  and decrease  disability  [25].  
Magee et al [26] reported  96% sensitivity  and 97% specificity  of 3T MRI in the detection  of meniscal  tears in

Several  studies reported  CT to be superior  to knee  radiographs  in detection  and classification  of fractures.  In a study 
by Mustonen  et al [12],  CT showed  100%  and radiographs  83% sensitivity  in detection  of tibial plateau fractures , 
and CT was superior  in further  characterization  of fracture  severity . 
In the setting  of acute knee  trauma,  Mui et al [13] reported  80% sensitivity  and 98% specificity  of the CT 
examination  in detecting  bony  avulsion  fractures and a high negative  predictive  value  for excluding  ligamentous  
injuries , but MRI remained  necessary  for the preoperative  detection  of meniscal  injury . 
Peltola  et al [14] compared  dual-energy  CT examinations  with MRI  studies as a reference standard  in 18 patients  
with acute knee  trauma  and reported  dual-energy  CT had 79% sensitivity  and 100%  specificity  in detecting  anterior  
cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures  [14]. 
In a study  by Heffernan  et al [15], 64-channel  multidetector  CT showed  87.5% to 100%  sensitivity  and 100%  
specificity  for detection  of the ACL  tears.  As on MRI,  secondary  signs,  such as buckling  of the posterior  cruciate 
ligament , were also useful  in their diagnosis.  In this study , multidetector  CT showed a low sensitivity  for other  soft-
tissue injuries  at the knee;  however,  its high specificity  indicated  that apparent  posterior  cruciate  ligament , meniscal,  
and collateral  ligament  tears can reliably  be treated  as true-positive  findings  [15]. 
The dual-energy  CT virtual  noncalcium  technique  can subtract  calcium  from  cancellous bone,  allowing  detection  
[16-18] and possibly grading of the post-traumatic  bone  marrow  contusions  [18]. 
However,  MRI is superior  to CT in detection  of bone  marrow  abnormalities  and meniscal  and ligamentous  injuries  
and may be subsequently  performed  as clinically  indicated.

MRI has many  distinct advantages for the evaluation  of the injured  knee  in the setting  of negative  radiographs.  
The majority  of patients  (93.5%)  who present  with acute  knee  injuries  in the emergency  department  sustained  soft-
tissue injuries  rather  than osseous injuries  [19].  MRI  is a proven valuable  tool in the treatment  decision -making  
process,  allowing  earlier  surgical  intervention  by obtaining  a more  accurate diagnosis  [20,21] . Frobell et al [22] 
reported  a low diagnostic  benefit  of the initial clinical  examination  in the setting  of acute knee  trauma  with higher -
than-suspected  incidence of the ACL  injuries  on MRI.

With  negative radiographs,  CT may be performed  as the next imaging study  for the evaluation  of suspected  
radiographically  occult  knee  fractures  [12] and bone  marrow  contusions  [16-18]. CT may diagnose  or predict  
ligamentous  injuries  [14,15,50,51]  and predict  menisc al [15,50,51]  injuries. However,  MRI is superior  to CT in

Even-Sapir et al [37] showed  promising results of a SPECT study  in diagnosis  of the ACL  and meniscal  tears and 
the associated  bone  contusions  in patients with acute knee trauma  with arthroscopic  and MRI correlation . However,

Arteriography  Lower Extremity  
Vascular  injury  may be found in about  30% of patients  following  posterior  knee  dislocation  [56]. Injuries  of the 
popliteal artery  require  prompt  surgical  intervention to help limb preservation . Associated  peroneal  and tibial nerve  
injuries  may cause significant  morbidity and require  an understanding of their pathophysiologic  implications  to 
maximize  limb functionality  [57]. Angiography  has been  the reference standard  in the evaluation  of vascular  injuries  
associated  with knee  dislocations  [58]. However,  this is an invasive  procedure  with associated  risk, and with the 
excellent  performance of CTA and MRA, it is usually  performed  in selected  cases  [58]. 
CT Knee  
CT is not routinely  used as the initial imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the knee.  CT is superior  
to knee  radiographs  in detection  and classification  of fractures [12]; however,  without  IV contrast , CT cannot  detect  
vascular  injuries. 
CTA Lower Extremity  
With  suspected  vascular  injuries  in the setting  of knee  dislocation, CTA  is frequently  used because it is less invasive  
and has a similar ly high accuracy  as conventional  angiography [58-60].

In patients  with significant  acute knee  trauma  with suspected  or possible  dislocation , MR arthrography  of the knee 
is not routinely used as the initial imaging  study.  
MRA Knee  
MRI is an accurate method used in the evaluation  of soft-tissue,  osseous,  and neural  injuries  after knee  dislocation  
[61]. MRA  may be performed  simultaneously  with MRI  for evaluation  of internal  derangement  and vascular  injuries  
with less morbidity  compared  with conventional  angiography  [62]. Potter  et al [61] reported  their experience with 
popliteal fossa MRA  with encouraging  results and complete agreement  between  the MRA  and conventional

2. Analysis of appropriateness based on the context:
According to the ACR Appropriateness Criteria for Chronic Ankle Pain, MRI is not routinely used as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain. However, if the patient has a focal soft-tissue abnormality or if there is concern for an initially missed fracture, MRI can be considered. MRI is effective in detecting osseous stress injuries and can globally evaluate all anatomic structures, including bone marrow.

3. Recommendation:

There is no r elevant literature  to support the use of MRI as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot

Radiography Foot  
Conventional radiography can be useful to distinguish among different causes of chronic foot pain and is usually 
the first imag ing study in evaluating patients with chronic foot pain.  
The value of radiographs in the diagnosis of tarsal coalitions has been extensively demonstrated. Overall 
sensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs 
in the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral 
and oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar 
coalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs 
on the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have 
been found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable 
methods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  
Radiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review 
by Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for 
radiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.  
Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  
usually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, 
osteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite 
versus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess 
with radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton’s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other 
causes of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg’s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals 
or soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . 
Though radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in 
patients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The 
combination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a 
specificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15]. 
US Foot  
Ultrasound (US) is usually not indicate d as the first imaging  study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain, but may 
be performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of pathologic conditions of the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, 
and other conditions such as tarsal tunnel syndrome, Morton’s  neuroma , plantar plate tears,  and intermetatarsal 
bursitis. 
Variant 2: Persistent posttraumatic foot pain. Radiographs negative or equivocal. Clinical concern includes 
complex regional pain syndrome type I. Next imaging study.  
3-Phase Bone Scan Foot  
A 3-phase bone scan may be useful in cases of suspected complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type I reflex 
sympathetic dystrophy , and several imaging findings have been described.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Ankle pain is considered chronic when symptoms persist > 6 weeks. Chronic ankle  pain can be caused by a variety 
of osseous or soft -tissue abnormalities, either alone or in combination. For assessing chronic ankle pain, there are 
multiple imaging options, including radiography, stress radiography,  computed tomography (CT)  radionuclide 
bone scanning, ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and various injection procedures. Injection 
proce dures include arthrography, CT arthrography, MR arthrography, and diagnostic injection with anesthetic 
agents. Although there are numerous causes for chronic ankle pain, common etiologies include osteoarthritis, 
osteochondral injury, tendon abnormalities, ligament abnormalities and instability, and impingement.  
Overview of Imaging Modalities  
Radiography Radiographs can provide information about the osseous and soft -tissue structures about the ankle. Routine 
radiographs of the ankle typically include anteroposterior, lateral, and mortise views, the latter obtained by internally rotating the foot 15 to 20 degrees.  Stress radiographs can be used to assess ankle instability  [1,2]; 
however , some have questioned their accuracy [3 ,4]. 
CT 
CT is not routinely used as a first -line imaging tool in chronic ankle pain, but it is more sensitive than 
radiographs, particularly for osseous abnormalities  [5]. CT arthrography may be more accurate than MR 
arthrography for the identification of osteochondral abnormalities  [6]. 
Bone Scan  
Conventional planar bone scintigraphy can assess osseous pathology.  More recently, single -photon emission 
computed tomogr aphy (SPECT)  combined with CT has been shown to provide additional information compared 
with clinical diagnosis and conventional bone scintigraphy for the evaluation of impingement syndromes and soft -
tissue pathology [7]. In addition, SPECT/CT abnormalities have been shown to significantly correlate with pain  in 
osteochondral lesions  [8]. 
US 
US can be used to evaluate for soft -tissue abnormalities, including tendon and ligament tears. In inflammatory 
arthritis, it can help in the assessment of disease activity and severity as well as detect subclinical pathology in 
early disease or after treatment [9 ]. US is ideal for dynamic assessment of peroneal tendon instability [10] and can 
be used to guide interventions  [11]. Compared with some other modalities, US is less prone to artifacts, such as 
susceptibility, motion, magic angle , and streak artifact, but dynamic assessment may be limited in cases of pain.  
MRI  
MRI is the imaging test that globally evaluates all anatomic structures, including ligaments, tendons, cartilage, 
and bone  [12,13]. Most studies have shown that MRI is highly accurate for evaluation of ligament, tendon,  and

abnormalities on MR I as compared to arthroscopy [ 17]. MRI can  identify synovitis and impingement lesions, 
which  can contribute to patient symptoms  [18].  
Discussion of Procedures  by Variant  
Variant 1: Chronic ankle pain. Initial imaging . 
Radiography 
Radiography should be considered as the initial imaging study . Radiographs may reveal osteoarthritis, calcified or 
ossif ied intra -articular bodies, osteochondral abnormalities, stress fractures,  or evidence of prior trauma. Ankle 
effusions may also be identified in the anterior ankle joint recess by radiography with 53% to 74% accuracy  [19]. 
They are often associated with ligamentous injury or fracture [19]. The presence of ossific fragments can indicate 
ligamentous injury or retinaculum avulsion [20], whereas periostitis can occur adjacent to tenosynovitis. 
Radiographs can also identify synovial osteochondromatosis and erosions from chronic synovitis.  
CT 
CT is not routinely used as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain.  
MRI  
MRI is not routinely used as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain.  
US 
US is not routinely used  as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain.  
Bone Scan  
Bone scan is not routinely used as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain.  
Variant 2: Chronic ankle pain. M ultiple sites of degenerative joint disease in the hindfoot  detected by ankle 
radiographs.  Next study.  
When multiple sites of osteoarthritis  are present, it may be important to determine which joint is the cause of 
symptoms.  
Image-guided Anesthetic Injection  
Several reports have indicated the effectiveness of fluo roscopic , CT, or US-guided anesthetic  [11] with or without 
corticosteroid injection of joints to identify a source  of pain, which aids in surgical planning [ 21-25].  
MRI  
When degenerative changes of the ankle joint are diagnosed based on radiographs, MRI may be considered as the 
next best examination to evaluate cartilage integrity, bone marrow, and associated soft tissues, such as ligaments 
and tendons, if these injuries are clinically suspected [13-15].  
CT 
CT without  contrast may be helpful to visualize subchondral cysts [5 ]. 
US 
US is not routinely used for the evaluation of degenerative joint disease.  
Bone Scan  
Bone scan is not routinely used for the evaluation of degenerative joi nt disease.  
Arthrography  
Arthrography is not routinely used for the evaluation of degenerative joint disease.  
MR Arthrography  
MR arthrography is not routinely used for the evaluation of degenerative joint disease.  
CT Arthrography  
CT arthrography is not rou tinely used for the evaluation of degenerative joint disease.  
Variant 3: Chronic ankle pain. Ankle radiographs normal, suspected osteochondral lesion. Next study . 
Osteochondral injuries may involve the talar dome and,  less commonly , the tibial plafond and tarsal navicular 
bone [5,26,27]. If this inju ry is associated with fracture, osseous cyst, or osteochondral defect, radiography may 
show the abnormality; however, radiography often fails to show the extent of the osteochondral injury and will be

Possible tendon abnormalities include tenosynovitis, tendinopathy, tendon tear (partial or complete), and tendon 
subluxation or dislocation.  Both MRI and US can effectively demonstrate ankle tendon abnormalities, although 
US results are more dependent on operator skill and expertise [ 10,35]. For the assessment , it is assumed the 
procedure is performed and interpreted by an expert.

If the patient has a focal soft -tissue abnormality , MRI can be considered.  Peripheral nerve-related symptoms can 
be evaluated with US or MRI; however, US has the benefit of higher resolution. If symptoms are believed to 
originate from osseous structures, MRI can be considered if there is concern for an initially missed fracture [80]. MRI is effective in detecting osseous stress injuries [81]. Overall, MRI is the imaging test that globally evaluates 
all anatomic str uctures, including bone marrow [13, 82].  
US 
US is best used as a focal examination and should not be used  for comprehensive evaluation of the ankle when no 
particular pathology is suspected.  If the patient has a focal soft -tissue abnormality , US can be considered. 
Peripheral nerve-related symptoms can be evaluated with US or MRI; however, US has the benefit o f higher 
resolution. US with dynamic evaluation should be considered when symptoms are only present during specific movements or positions [83 ,84].

If symptoms are believed to originate from osseous structures, CT can be considered if there is concern for an initially missed fracture [80].  CT has been shown to be superior to radiography  for fracture detection  [85].  
Bone Scan with SPECT or SPECT/CT  
SPECT/CT is an emerging imaging modality for evaluation of ankle pathology and can detect osteochondral 
lesions, osteoarthritis, tarsal coalition, occult fractures, or pa inful accessory bones [86].

2. Analysis of appropriateness based on the context:
According to the ACR Appropriateness Criteria for Chronic Ankle Pain, initial imaging for chronic ankle pain should be radiography. MRI is not routinely used as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain. However, in this case, the patient has already undergone X-ray which showed no fracture or dislocation but revealed mild ankle degeneration. Therefore, the next appropriate study would be MRI to assess for osteochondral lesion.

3. Recommendation:
Classification: USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE
Explanation: MRI is not usually the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain. However, in this case, the patient has already undergone X-ray which did not reveal any fracture or dislocation but showed mild ankle degeneration. Therefore, MRI is being ordered to assess for osteochondral lesion.

41% of osteochondral abnormalities of the ankle were missed on radiography.  
MRI  
In one multimodality study, MRI performed similar ly to arthroscopy for the evaluation of osteochondral 
abnorm alities of the ankle [5]. Although MRI had the highest sensitivity (96%), it was less specific than CT [5 ]. 
MRI is effective in determining osteochondral injury instability (sensitivity 97%), most commonly appearing as a 
high signal line deep to the os teochondral lesion on T2-weighted images or less commonly as a focal defect, an 
articular fracture, or an adjacent cyst [28]. MRI has also been used to stage these lesions preoperatively with an 
accuracy of 81% [29] and to assess osteochondral abnormalities after cartilage repair [30]. Although MRI may be 
less reliable than CT arthrography for talar cartilaginous lesions (accuracy between 76 % to 88%) [6], high-
resolution MRI using a microscopy coil (e g, a 4 -cm receive-only surface coil) can assist in detecting small, 
clinically relevant features of talar osteochondral lesions that may be missed on standard MRI, including 
osteochondral junction separation due to focal collapse of the subchondral bone, reparative cartilage hypertrophy, 
and bone separation in the absence of cartilage fracture [31].  
CT Arthrography  
The introduction of contrast into the ankle joi nt prior to CT will outline a cartilage surface defect, assisting in 
lesion detection and assessment for instability. One study comparing CT arthrography and MR arthrography for 
talar cartilaginous lesions found an accuracy between 76 % to 88% using MR arthrography compared to 90% to 
92% for CT arthrography, suggesting that CT arthrography may be more reliable [6 ]. 
MR Arthrography  
The introduction of contrast into the  ankle joint prior to MRI will outline a cartilage surface defect, assisting in 
lesion detection and assessment for instability. One study comparing CT arthrography and MR arthrography for talar cartilaginous lesions found an accuracy between 76 % to 88% us ing MR arthrography compared to 90% to 
92% for CT arthrography, suggesting that CT arthrography may be more reliable [6 ]. 
CT 
In one multimodality study, CT (noncont rast, multidetector with multiplanar reformatted images) performed 
similar ly to arthroscopy for the evaluation of osteochondral abnormalities of the ankle  [5]. However, CT was 
more specific (99%) but less sensitive then MRI [5 ]. 
Bone Scan  with SPECT or  SPECT /CT 
When osteochondral injuries are associated with fracture, osseous cyst, or osteochondral defect, bone scans may 
show the abnormality. One study evaluating the role of SPECT/CT in assessing osteochondral defects in the ankle 
found that this study affected the surgeon’s ultimate decision regarding treatment in 48 % to 52% of cases , as it 
allowed for improved evaluation of the subchondral bone and subchondral bone plate [32]. SPECT/CT abnormalities have also been shown to significantly correlate with pain in the setting of osteochondral lesions [8 ] 
and to precisely  localize the painful regions in the setting of multiple lesions  [33,34]. 
US 
US is not routinely  used for the evaluation of osteochondral lesions in the ankle.

subtalar motion after a period of immobilizat ion [49]. 
CT with IV contrast is not ind icated in this scenario because soft-tissue abnormalities and fluid collections can be 
identified on noncontr ast high -resolution CT studies. 
MRI Ankle  
MRI of the ankle without IV contrast is most sensitive for evaluation of occult fractures with associated bone 
marrow edema patterns, particularly in inversion injuries and persistent lateral ankle pain, as well  as presence and 
extent of soft -tissue injuries  [29]. Stress injuries of bone , including those of the weekend warrior , are best depicted 
by MRI  [50]. 
MRI is the reference standard for ligamentous injury and assessment of stability , which is particularly important in 
athletes, in whom determination of grade ( 1, 2, or 3) of syndesmotic ligament, anterior tibiofibular ligament , and 
deltoid injuries is critical for treatment planning and return to sport assessment [51]. High -resolution evaluation of 
the tendons and ligaments allows distinction between tendinopathy, sprain, and partial or complete tears.  
Ligament and tendon  injuries can occur without fracture on radiography . Gross terlinden et al [52] compared MR I 
and radiography and showed that 15% of ligamentous injuries ( including sprains , partial tears, and complete tears) 
at the syndesmosis in acute ankle injuries on MRI demonstrated no fracture on radiography. Presence o f bone bruise 
and adjacent soft -tissue edema have shown a higher association with acute ligamentous injuries ( anterior talofibular 
ligament most common) and tendon abnormalities [53,54]  in patients with negative radiographs.  MRI can also help 
exclude Salter 1 fractures in the pediatric population [55]. 
Radiography Ankle  
Repeat radiograph s are not typically the next study but may be of use to identify early callous formation at an occult 
fracture line or possible mineralization at a site of intramuscular hematoma if contusion occurred during trauma. 
Radiographs with better technique may assist in diagnosis of subtle injuries such as the lateral talar process avulsion , 
which  may erroneously be diagnosed as  a lateral ankle sprain  [37]. 
Radiography Ankle Stress Views  
Although ankle stress views are not the typical next best study for this patient group, if  there is clinical evidence of 
instability on physician maneuvers, ankle stress views may be of benefit for identification of occult avulsion injury 
at ligamentous attachments that may contribute t o widening of the joint spac e on radiographic stress views.  
US Ankle  
US is not typically  the next imaging study . US may be useful as a secondary evaluation modality for focuse d 
evaluation of underlying soft -tissue injuries  and ligaments, with the added benefit of dynamic imaging. This 
includes f ocused high-resolution US of the peroneal tendons and th e superior peroneal retinaculum  [56], stress US 
(during anterior drawer) to assess joint laxity or chondral avulsion fra ctures associated with lateral ligament injury 
in children with negative radiographs [57,58] , and potential detection of superficial occult fractures at the base of 
the fifth metatarsal, lateral malleolus,  and malleolus [41] .

abnormalities on MR I as compared to arthroscopy [ 17]. MRI can  identify synovitis and impingement lesions, 
which  can contribute to patient symptoms  [18].  
Discussion of Procedures  by Variant  
Variant 1: Chronic ankle pain. Initial imaging . 
Radiography 
Radiography should be considered as the initial imaging study . Radiographs may reveal osteoarthritis, calcified or 
ossif ied intra -articular bodies, osteochondral abnormalities, stress fractures,  or evidence of prior trauma. Ankle 
effusions may also be identified in the anterior ankle joint recess by radiography with 53% to 74% accuracy  [19]. 
They are often associated with ligamentous injury or fracture [19]. The presence of ossific fragments can indicate 
ligamentous injury or retinaculum avulsion [20], whereas periostitis can occur adjacent to tenosynovitis. 
Radiographs can also identify synovial osteochondromatosis and erosions from chronic synovitis.

CT is not routinely used as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain.  
MRI  
MRI is not routinely used as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain.  
US 
US is not routinely used  as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain.  
Bone Scan  
Bone scan is not routinely used as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain.  
Variant 2: Chronic ankle pain. M ultiple sites of degenerative joint disease in the hindfoot  detected by ankle 
radiographs.  Next study.  
When multiple sites of osteoarthritis  are present, it may be important to determine which joint is the cause of 
symptoms.  
Image-guided Anesthetic Injection  
Several reports have indicated the effectiveness of fluo roscopic , CT, or US-guided anesthetic  [11] with or without 
corticosteroid injection of joints to identify a source  of pain, which aids in surgical planning [ 21-25].  
MRI  
When degenerative changes of the ankle joint are diagnosed based on radiographs, MRI may be considered as the 
next best examination to evaluate cartilage integrity, bone marrow, and associated soft tissues, such as ligaments 
and tendons, if these injuries are clinically suspected [13-15].  
CT 
CT without  contrast may be helpful to visualize subchondral cysts [5 ]. 
US 
US is not routinely used for the evaluation of degenerative joint disease.  
Bone Scan  
Bone scan is not routinely used for the evaluation of degenerative joi nt disease.

Variant 3: Chronic ankle pain. Ankle radiographs normal, suspected osteochondral lesion. Next study . 
Osteochondral injuries may involve the talar dome and,  less commonly , the tibial plafond and tarsal navicular 
bone [5,26,27]. If this inju ry is associated with fracture, osseous cyst, or osteochondral defect, radiography may 
show the abnormality; however, radiography often fails to show the extent of the osteochondral injury and will be

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 10 Acute Trauma to the Ankle  Rare pantalar dislocations without associated talar or other fracture can be assessed on CT or MRI and have high 
rates of osteonecrosis, osteoarthritis, and infection  [71]. 
MRI Ankle  
MRI is the reference standard for ligamentous injury and assessment of stability , which is particularly important in 
athletes, in whom determination of grade (1, 2,  or 3) of syndesmotic ligament, anterior tibiofibular ligament , and 
deltoid injuries is critica l for treatment planning and return to sport assessment [51] . 
Ligamentous injuries can occur without fracture on radiography. Grossterlinden et al  [52] compared MRI and 
radiography and showed that 15% of ligamentous injuries (including sprains, partial tears, and complete tears) at 
the syndesmosis in acute ankle injuries on M RI demonstra ted no fracture on radiography.  
Rare pantalar dislocations without associated talar or other fracture can be assessed on CT or MRI and have high 
rates of osteonecrosis, osteoarthritis, and infection  [71]. 
Radiography Ankle Stress Views  
Stress radiograph s may be useful in assessing syndesmotic instability, particularly in supination external rotation 
ankle injuries according to the Lauge -Hansen classification. Lee et al [72]  noted that tibiotalar tilt angle and anterior 
tibiofibular space measurements were affected when the anterior tibiofibular and posterior talofibular ligaments 
were injured (confirmed on MRI) in 299 patients . Lateral stress testing with widening of the tibiofibular clear space 
has been shown to be  an indicator of syndesmotic injury , with the traditional external rotation stress test shown to 
be a poor indicator when t he deltoid ligament is injured [73] . 
Radiography Leg 
Maisonneuve fracture (syndesmotic injury of the ankle in combination with a proximal fibular fracture) may be 
overlooked as a result of  lack of pain at the fibula. Careful palpation of the proximal fibula should be performed 
with radiographic evaluation of the entire tibia and fibular if focal tenderness is present [74] . 
US Ankle  
US is not typically the next line of evaluation  of syndesmotic injuries. Although some studies have suggested 
focused US could be beneficial for ligamentous evaluation, others have shown limited utility in lateral ankle 
ligament spr ains [75]. 
Summary of Recommendations  
Variant 1: Ankle radiographs are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of patients 5 years of age or older with 
acute trauma to the ankle or acute trauma to the ankle with persistent pain for more than 1 week but less than 3 
weeks with no exclusionar y criteria present and the OAR  are positive : 1. Inability to bear weight immediately after 
the injury, OR  2. Point tenderness over the medial malleolus, the posterior edge or inferior tip of the lateral 
malleolus, talus, or calcaneus, OR  3. Inability to ambulate for 4 steps in the emergency department.  
Variant 2: Imaging is usually not appropriate for patients 5 years of age or older with a cute trauma to the ankle 
when the patient is able  to walk  and there are no exclusionary criteria present (eg, neurologically intact (includ ing 
no peripheral neuropathy )) and  the OAR  are negative: No point tenderness over the malleoli, talus, or calcaneus on 
physical examination.  
Variant 3: Ankle radiographs are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of patients 5 ye ars of age or older  with 
acute trauma to the ankle when exclusionary criteria are present (eg, neurologic disorder, neuropathy, or other) and 
the patient does not meet requirements for evaluation by the OAR . 
Variant 4: MRI ankle without IV contrast or CT a nkle without IV contrast  are usually appropriate  for patients 5 
years of age or older with acute trauma to the ankle with persistent pain for more than 1 week but less than 3 weeks 
that had negative initial radiographs and no exclusionary criteria are present.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 8 Chronic Wrist Pain  abnormalities responsible for pain when there is no ligament or TFCC abnormality. Because of these limitations, 
arthrography  has now largely been supplanted by cross-sectional imaging. Fluoroscopic -guided intra -articular 
injections are chiefly used as a first step when performing arthrographic  computed tomography ( CT) and 
magnetic resonance imaging (MR I) studies [8]. 
MRI  
Wrist MRI accurately depicts abnormalities of the bones and bone marrow, articular cartilage, intrinsic and 
extrinsic ligaments, TFCC, synovium, tendons, and neurovascular structures, making it a powerful study for 
chronic pai n caused by diverse etiologies.  
A dedicated receiver coil or transmit -receive coil is necessary to provide the signal -to-noise ratio needed for high-
resolution, high-contrast MRI of the wrist [9 ]. MR arthrography —either with direct contrast injection into one  or 
more wrist compartments or performed indirectly after intravenous (IV) contrast administration —can enhance the 
yield of the study for diagnosing internal wrist derangements, especially abnormalities of the ligaments, articular cartilage, and TFCC of the wrist. MRI performed with a 3.0 T magnet and a dedicated coil provides better signal -
to-noise ratio and better contrast compared with wrist MR I performed with 1.5 T  or lower field strength systems 
[10,11]. 
CT 
CT of the wr ist is used primarily when high-det ail imaging of bone cortex or trabeculae is needed. In patients with 
chronic wrist pain and prior fractures, CT is typically the study of choice to evaluate fracture healing and joint 
congruence. When a radiographically occult fracture is suspected as the cause of a patient’s chronic pain, either 
CT or MRI can be used [12]. Advantages of CT over MRI for the wrist include  its ability to obtain high -resolution 
images of both wrists simultaneously and the much shorter acquisition times for CT. These factors make CT the 
preferred examination for suspected distal radioulnar joint subluxation, where images of both wrists can be  
obtained in both supination and pronation [1 ,13]. A disadvantage of CT  is its lower sensitivity to soft -tissue 
abnormalities  compared with MRI.  
High-resolution (typically multidetector) CT of the wrist following contrast injection into one or more wrist 
compartments (CT arthrography) is a powerful tool for diagnosing intra -articular abnormalities [14,15]. The 
intraobserver agreement on CT arthrogram images is extremely high and better than that reported for MRI 
[14,16]. 
US 
US of the wrist is useful for examining extra -articular soft tissues, such as suspected ganglion cyst s [17], because 
its accuracy is similar to that of MRI. US can also be used to diagnose abnormalities of the flexor and extensor 
tendons and tendon sheaths. For de Quervain disease (stenosing tenosynovitis of the abductor pollicis lon gus and 
extensor pollicis brevis tendon compartment), preoperative identification of a septum or subcompartmentalization 
within the first dorsal compartment with US  may affect surgical management [18 ,19]. 
In patients with suspected or established rheumatoid arthritis (RA), US examination of the wrist and selected 
finger joints can identify erosions and active synovit is (with the use of power Doppler), findings that influence 
early diagnosis and treatment decisions [20]. Using US to measure the size of the median nerve is a  validated  
technique in patients with clinical symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome [21-24].  
In addition, w rist US is a useful technique to guide therapeutic intr a-articular and other soft -tissue injections [25].

T2-weighted  MR neurography is the reference standard  for imaging  ulnar  nerve  entrapment  (UNE)  [48-50]. Most  
common  findings  include  high signal  intensity  and nerve  enlargement  [50]. Diagnostic confidence can be increased  
with the use of diffusion -tensor  imaging  [49,51] . Diffusion -tensor  imaging  and tractography  also provide  
quantitative  information  in 3-D perspective [47,49] . Howev er, 3T MRI has only fair-to-moderate agreement  for 
localization  of compression  points  in UNE  [52,53] . Radial  nerve,  median  nerve,  and other  entrapment  syndromes  
can also be evaluated  with MRI [54,55] . 
US Elbow  
US elbow  is another  option  for evaluation  of UNE.  Assessment  of cross-sectional  area/ner ve thickness has high 
accuracy  rates [48,56-58] . US also accurately  demonstrates  hourglass  constriction  of the nerve  [59]. Dynamic  US 
is helpful  in demonstrating  nerve  dislocation  in ulnar  nerve  neuropathy and snapping triceps syndrome  [59-62]. 
Shear -wave elastography is a newer  method used for the diagnosis  of ulnar  neuropathy  at the elbow.  Values of 
100%  specificity,  sensitivity, and both positive  and negative  predictive  value  have  been  reported  [63,64] . 
Summary  of Recommendations 
• Variant 1 : Radiography elbow  is usually appropriate for the initial imaging of  chronic elbow pain.  
• Variant 2 : In the setting of chronic elbow pain with mechanical symptoms such as locking, clicking, or limited 
range of motion with normal or nonspecific radiographs, MR arthrography elbow or MRI elbow without IV 
contrast or CT arthrography elbow or CT elbow without IV contrast  is usually appropriate as the next imaging 
study for suspect intra-articular pathology such as osteocartilaginous body, osteochondral lesion, or synovial 
abnormality. These procedures are equivalent altern atives (ie, only one procedure will be ordered to provide 
the clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).

will be ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care). Although the panel 
did not agree on recommending 3-phase bone scan elbow, because there is insufficient medical literature to 
conclude whether these patients would benefit from the procedure, its use may be appropri ate. 
• Variant 4 : In the setting of chronic elbow pain with normal or nonspecific radiographs,  US elbow or MRI 
elbow without IV contrast is usually appropriate  as the next imaging study for suspected chronic epicondylalgia

the trochlea [16]. 
MRI Elbow  
MRI elbow  may detect  loose  bodies,  and this is enhanced  in the presence of joint fluid.  Thus,  T2-weighted  images  
are recommended for the evaluation  of loose  bodies  in the elbow  [17]. MRI may also show  the presence of enlarged  
plica,  which  can result  in symptoms  of locking  and/or  pain with extension  [15]. MRI is often  suggested  as the initial  
study to assess for osteochondral  lesion  [12,17] . MRI  is less sensitive  than radiographs  in the detection  of 
heterotopic  ossification/calcification  [18]. Similar  to MR arthrography,  MRI elbow  is limited  in the evaluation  of 
cartilage defects [16]. 
US Elbow  
Although US may demonstrate  early -stage osteochondral  lesions and medial  epicondylar  fragmentation  [10], the 
details  of an osteochondral  lesion  are better  defined  by CT arthrography or MR arthrography.  Because of 
shadowing,  evaluation  of heterotopic  ossification  and loose  bodies  is limited  on US. 
Variant  3: Chronic  elbow  pain.  Suspect  occult  stress fracture or other bone  abnormality. Radiographs  
normal  or nonspecific . Next  imaging  study. 
3-Phase  Bone  Scan  Elbow  
Bone  scan is extremely  sensitiv e for detection  of stress fractures  and trauma  related  fractures [19-21] . 
Radiopharmaceutical  uptake  occurs in areas  of active bone  turnover , and thus, imaging  may be positive  in the 
presymptomatic  stage of stress injuries  [20]. 
CT Arthrography  Elbow  
There is limited  evidence to the support  the use of CT arthrography  elbow  for the detection  of occult  fractures  
following  radiographs.  
CT Elbow  
CT elbow  is helpful  in identifying  complex  fracture  patterns,  the origin  of dislocated  fragments,  and position s of

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  elbow  pain is a common  patient  complaint  in the primary  care setting. Patients  may report  symptoms  of 
swelling,  pain,  restricted  range  of motion,  stiffness,  and numbness  or tingling  [1]. There is a wide  differential  
diagnosis  for chronic  elbow  pain, including osseous,  soft tissue,  cartil aginous , and nerve -related  abnormalities.  
Epicondylalgia , caused  by tendinosis  of the common  extensor  tendon laterally  (“tennis elbow”)  or medially  the 
common  flexor  tendon  (“golfer’s  elbow ”), is the most  common  cause of chronic  elbow  pain,  estimated  to occur in 
1% to 3% of the population  [2]. Epicondylalgia  is associated  with lost workdays  and a significant  economic  burden  
[3]. Both  occupational  and recreational  causes play a role in development  of epicondylalgia  as well as other  causes  
of chronic  elbow  pain,  including  biceps tendinopathy,  osteochondral  injuries, collateral  ligament  tears,  and cubital  
tunnel  syndrome.  
Imaging plays  an important  role in assessment  of chronic  elbow  pain.  Electromyography  assists in the workup 
related  to nerve  symptoms.  Management  for epicondylalgia  and osteoarthritis  includes  conservative measures such 
as rest, activity  modification, analgesia,  physical  therapy,  and corticosteroid  injections. Surgery  may be indicated  
for more  severe or refractory  cases and cases of collateral  ligament  injury,  biceps injury, cubital  tunnel  syndrome,  
or osteochondral  abnormalities.  
Special Imaging  Considerations  
Stress radiographs  to detect  medial  joint line opening  and/or  asymmetry  to the contralateral  elbow  are available to 
evaluate valgus  instability  of the elbow.  
Initial Imaging  Definition 
Initial imaging  is defined  as imaging  at the beginning of the care episode for the medical  condition defined  by the 
variant.  More  than one procedure  can be considered  usually  appropriate  in the initial imaging  evaluation  when : 
• There are procedures  that are equivalent  alternatives (ie, only one procedure  will be ordered  to 
provide  the clinical  information  to effectively  manage the patient’s  care)  
OR 
• There are complementary  procedures  (ie, more  than one procedure  is ordered  as a set or 
simultaneously  where each procedure  provides  unique  clinical  information  to effectively  manage  
the patient’s  care).

MRI has high inter- and intraobserver  reliability  for the diagnosi s of epicondylalgia  [26]. It also has a sensitivity  of 
90% to 100%  and a specificity  of 83% to 100%  [27]. The most  specific findings  of medial  epicondylalgia  include  
interm ediate to high T2 signal  or high T2 signal  within  the common  flexor  tendon  and paratendinous  soft tissue  
edema [28]. MRI has the benefit  of demonstrating associated  findings  in epicondylalgia , including radial  collateral  
and lateral  UCL  injuries  [26]. MRI may also facilitate  surgical  planning [29]. 
MRI is useful  for the diagnosis  of biceps  tendon injury.  Sensitivity  and specificity  are reported  at 92.4%  and 100%,  
respectively,  in detecting  distal  biceps tendon  ruptures  and 59.1%  and 100%,  respectively  for partial  tears [30]. 
US Elbow  
US elbow  has moderate agreement  with MR elbow  for the diagnosis  and grading of common  extensor  tendon tears.  
US sensitivity, specificity,  and accuracy  are reported  at 64.25%,  85.19%,  and 72.73% , respectively  [31]. Recently,  
sonoelastography  has shown more  promising outcomes for detection  of medial  epicondylalgia  with a sensitivity,  
specificity,  accuracy,  positive  predictive  value , and negative  predictive  value  of 95.2%,  92%,  93.5%,  90.9%,  and 
95.8%,  respectively  [32]. Another  new technique,  superb  microvascular  imaging,  can be used to detect  subtle  low 
blood  flow.  The combination of superb  microvascular  imaging  with conventional  US performed  best for the 
diagnosis  of epicondylalgia , with sensitivity  of 94%,  specificity  of 98%,  accuracy  of 96% [33]. 
US is also useful  for detection  of biceps  tendon abnormalities . It performs  similar  to slightly better  than MRI  for 
the diagnos is of distal  biceps brachii  tendon tear [34]. Reports  show  95% sensitivity, 71% specificity,  and 91% 
accuracy  for the diagnosis  of complete versus partial  distal  biceps tendon tears with US [35].

MRI Elbow  
MRI elbow  may detect  loose  bodies,  and this is enhanced  in the presence of joint fluid.  Thus,  T2-weighted  images  
are recommended for the evaluation  of loose  bodies  in the elbow  [17]. MRI may also show  the presence of enlarged  
plica,  which  can result  in symptoms  of locking  and/or  pain with extension  [15]. MRI is often  suggested  as the initial  
study to assess for osteochondral  lesion  [12,17] . MRI  is less sensitive  than radiographs  in the detection  of

Variant 12: Chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or nonspecific. Suspect carpal tunnel syndrome.  Next 
study. 
US Wrist 
Several meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the 
carpal  tunnel  inlet) is highly accurate for identifying carpal  tunnel syndrome  diagnosed clinically or with the 
combination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US 
varies depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the 
measurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary 
examination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel 
syndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal 
tunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, 
clinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of 
carpal tunnel syndrome. US may be appropriate in cases where this initial evaluation is equivocal.  
MRI Wrist  
Historically, carpal tunnel syndrome has been diagnosed based on clinical signs and sympt oms and confirmed by 
the results of electrodiagnostic studies [67]. MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in cases in which this  
initial evaluation is equivocal. The MRI findings that have been reported in wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome —
including nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing—may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value 
in patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68]. In rare cases of secondary carpal tunnel syndrome, MRI may identify 
a mass lesion compressing the median nerve. There is some evidence that the length of T2 hyperintensity in the 
median nerve can help prognosticate the success of surgery [69] and that the shape and signal of the nerve predict 
clinical response to a steroid injection in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome [70 ]. MR neurography 
may be an option in patients with suspected carpal tunnel syndrome.  The use o f IV contrast does not contribute to 
diagnosis and is usually not appropriate.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
MR arthrography is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.  
CT Wrist  
CT, with or without IV  contrast, is not routinely used to diagnose carpa l tunnel syndrome.  
CT Arthrography  Wrist  
CT arthrography is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.  
Bone Scan  Wrist  
Bone scan is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.  
Arthrography  Wrist  
Radiographic arthrography  is not routinely us ed to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome . 
Summary of Recommendations  
• Wrist radiographs are indicated as the best initial imaging examination in patients with chronic wrist pain. 
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal and a patient has persistent symptoms wi th an unclear diagnosis, 
MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate.  
• In patients with suspected inflammatory arthritis, MRI either with or without IV contrast is usually 
appropriate if guidance for management or prognostication is needed.  
• Patients with  suspected wrist infection should undergo aspiration.  
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal in a patient with ulnar -sided pain, either MRI without IV contrast 
or an MR arthrogram of the wrist is usually appropriate.  
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal in a patient with radial -sided pain, MRI without IV contrast is 
usually appropriate.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 10 Chronic Wrist Pain  importantly, though, the finding of enhancing bone marrow “edema” (osteitis) on MRI studies in patients with 
early RA is proving to be the best single predictor of future disease progression and functional dete rioration, even 
compared to serologies and clinical measures [27, 28,32-34].  
US Wrist  
The diagnosis of a specific inflammatory arthritis is typically established based on clinical and laboratory 
analysis. Advanced imaging is usually performed to determine disease activity, guide management decisions, and prognosticate outcomes. In patients with RA, US  of the wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints can  show 
inflammation  as active synovitis. Identifying active synovitis with power Doppler assessment is a useful adjunct 
in making an early diagnosis of RA when a pati ent with early arthritis does not meet the 2010 criteria established 
by the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism [20]. The presence of 
synovitis predicts progression of erosions [31 ] and erosions themselves [35]. US can also depict small bone 
erosions with high spatial resolution; h owever, US is less sensitive to erosions that occur on the radial or ulnar 
sides of the inner carpal bones because direct scanning of these regions is blocked, unlike the dorsal and volar 
bone surfaces. Furthermore, unlike MRI, US cannot show changes within the bone marrow, which are  the 
strongest prognosticator s for disease progression in RA [27, 28,32-34].  In patients with established inflammatory 
arthritis who are undergoing therapy, judging progression or reduction of synovitis may be more difficult with 
sequential US compared to sequential MRI.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
MR arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected inflammatory 
arthritides. 
CT Wrist  
While CT is more sensitive than radiographs for erosions, CT is not routinely used for the diagnosis and 
management of patients with suspected inflammatory arthritides . 
CT Arthrography  Wrist  
CT arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected inflammatory 
arthritides. 
Bone Scan  Wrist  
Bone scan does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients  with suspected inflammatory 
arthritides. 
Arthrography  Wrist  
Radiographic arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected 
inflammatory arthritides. 
Variant 4: Chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or show nonspecific ar thritis. Exclude infection. Next 
study. 
Aspiration  Wrist  
No literature directly addresses the appropriateness of imaging studies beyond radiographs in patients with 
suspected infection in the wrist. However, generalizing from experience with septic arthrit is in other joints, joint 
aspiration should not be delayed in order to obtain advanced imaging studies. In cases of suspected septic arthritis, 
percutaneous aspiration of the wrist is indicated, even when radiographs appear normal. Aspirates should be 
analyzed by cell count, gram stain, and appropriate cultures. Microscopic crystal analysis should also be obtained 
if there is a possibility of gout, acute pseudogout, or hydroxyapatite deposition disease. Aspiration can be 
performed without imaging guidance i f the joint is distended, but either fluoroscopy or US  may be useful if a 
specific compartment is to be targeted.  
MRI Wrist  
There may be a role for MRI with IV contrast enhancement in the staging of infections (for example, to delineate the location and extent of soft-tissue abscesses)  after aspiration has been performed.  Especially in chronic cases, 
MRI with IV contrast may be useful to identify a fluid collection or joint effusion to target  for aspiration.  
However, MRI is usually not appropriate as the next study after radiographs for suspected wrist infections.

Therefore, ordering an MRI forefoot with and without IV contrast for evaluation of gout is usually not appropriate.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 9 Chronic  Extremity  Joint  Pain Image -Guided Aspiration  Area  of Interest  
Image -guided aspiration  may be helpful  in confirming  and characterizing  crystal  deposition disease and excluding  
infection. The identification  of urate crystals in the aspirate is diagnostic  of gout.  If urate crystals are not seen in the 
aspirate;  however,  this does not necessarily  exclude  gout.  Up to 16% patients  diagnosed with acute gout can have  
negative  aspirates [56]. 
MRI Area  of Interest  Without  and With  IV Contrast  
MRI can show  the presence of tophi,  crystal  induced  synovitis,  and joint damage [57]; however , the 2018 EULAR  
recommendations  state that MRI has limited  utility  for diagnosis  of gout compared  with US and DECT. MRI  with 
or without IV contrast  is not supported for routine  evaluation  of gout in the extremities  following  initial  radiographs

MRI can show  the presence of tophi,  crystal  induced  synovitis,  and joint damage [57]; however , the 2018 EULAR

[55]. 
US Area  of Interest  
The 2018 EULAR  recommendations  favor  US over other  modalities  [55]. The Outcome  Measures in Rheuma tology  
definitions  of US elementary  lesions in gout include  double  contour  sign,  tophus,  aggregates,  and erosions [58]. 
Identification  of the double  contour  sign and soft tissue  tophi  are highly  sensitive,  specific,  and accurate for the 
diagnosis  of gout [59,60] , with double  contour  sign having  excellent  reliability  [61]. US has been  shown  to 
outperform  clinical  assessment  in the diagnosis  of gout [50] and outperforms  radiography in the detection  of 
erosions,  although  limitations  exist  if an erosion  involves  an area of bone  that is inaccessible to US evaluation  [62]. 
There is evidence that US may have  higher  sensitivity  for detection  of gout compared  with DECT  in early  gout 
(duration <1 year)  [63]. US has also been  shown  to be helpful  in assessment  of tophus  resolution  in response to 
treatment  [64,65] . 
Variant  4: Chronic extremity joint pain. Suspect calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (pseudogout). 
Radiographs normal or inconclusive. Next imaging study.  
The EULAR  defines CPPD as a general  term encompassing  variable phenotypes,  including  asymptomatic  
involvement,  acute CPP crystal  arthritis, osteoarthritis  with CPPD, and chronic  CPP crystal  inflammatory  arthritis  
[66]. CPPD  is thought  to have  high prevalence in the elderly  [67] but is underdiagnosed.  CPPD  joint involvement  
as defined  by EULAR  is when  CPP is detected  in the synovial  fluid  from  affected  joints  [66]. Diagnosis is often  
challenging;  however,  because the reference standard  of synovial  fluid  analysis has been  shown  to have  a high 
specificity  (100%)  but a lower  sensitivity  (75%)  [68]. Chondrocalcinosis  is defined  as cartilage calcification  
detected  by imaging  or histological examination  and is most  commonly due to CPPD . However,  the relationship  
between  chondrocalcinosis  and commonly coexisting  conditions  like osteoarthritis  and hemochromatosis  is poorly  
understood.

preferred  method for evaluation  of RA [18]. 
US has been  used to evaluate for osseous abnormalities  in the setting  of chronic  inflammatory  arthritis. Compared  
with radiography,  US has been  shown  to demonstrate a 6.5-fold  increase in the number  of detected  erosions of the 
metacarpophalangeal  joints  [12], but it is less accurate when  compared  with CT [11]. The f alse-positive  rate for US 
in detection  of metacarpophalangeal  joint erosions  has been  reported  as high as 29% [29]. Regardless,  large  erosions  
identified  with US at the second  and third  metacarpophalangeal  joints, the distal  ulna,  and the fifth 
metatarsophalangeal  joint are highly specific for and predictive  of RA [30]. US may also show  imaging  findings  
associated  with enthesitis  [25], with findings  of enthesitis  on power  Doppler  imaging  having  an accuracy  of 85.6% 
in distinguishing  peripheral  spondyloarthritis  versus nonspondyloarthropathy [31]. Studies  have  also found US to 
be helpful  in differentiating  RA and psoriatic  arthritis  [32,33] ; for example,  enthesitis  is a finding often  seen in 
spondyloarthritis  but not seen in RA. Increased  distance between  the nail and distal  phalanx in patients  with psoriatic  
arthritis  and cutaneous  psoriasis is reported  to have  an 80% sensitivity  and a 71% specificity  [34]. 
US is also useful  in the evaluation  for synovitis  and tenosynovitis,  aided  by the detection  of hyperemia via color  or 
Doppler  signal  [23]. Power  Doppler  US is more  accurate for the diagnosis  of synovitis  and has a higher  correlation  
with disease activity  compared  with grayscale US [35,36] . Synovitis  on power  Doppler  US and grayscale US are 
both associated  with the development  of radiographic  erosions  in patients  with RA compared  with grayscale US 
[37,38] . Newer  techniques  for detecting  microvascularization  associated  with joint inflammation  like multimodal  
photoacoustic/ US and ultra-microangiography have  shown  promise  as indicators  of disease activity  [39,40] . 
US also provides  prognostic  information  (such  as detecting  synovitis)  that is linked to disease progression [13], 
although  mild synovial  hypertrophy as an isolated  finding  is not specific and has limited  relevance [41]. In the 
evaluation  of the finger  joints  with US, dorsal  evaluation  is recommended  over palmar  [42]. Abbreviated  US 
scanning  protocols  of the hands,  wrists,  and feet to improve  efficiency  have  been  described  [43-46].

There is no r elevant literature  to support the use of MRI as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot

Radiography Foot  
Conventional radiography can be useful to distinguish among different causes of chronic foot pain and is usually 
the first imag ing study in evaluating patients with chronic foot pain.  
The value of radiographs in the diagnosis of tarsal coalitions has been extensively demonstrated. Overall 
sensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs 
in the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral 
and oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar 
coalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs 
on the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have 
been found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable 
methods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  
Radiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review 
by Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for 
radiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.  
Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  
usually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, 
osteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite 
versus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess 
with radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton’s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other 
causes of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg’s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals 
or soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . 
Though radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in 
patients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The 
combination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a 
specificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15]. 
US Foot  
Ultrasound (US) is usually not indicate d as the first imaging  study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain, but may 
be performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of pathologic conditions of the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, 
and other conditions such as tarsal tunnel syndrome, Morton’s  neuroma , plantar plate tears,  and intermetatarsal 
bursitis. 
Variant 2: Persistent posttraumatic foot pain. Radiographs negative or equivocal. Clinical concern includes 
complex regional pain syndrome type I. Next imaging study.  
3-Phase Bone Scan Foot  
A 3-phase bone scan may be useful in cases of suspected complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type I reflex 
sympathetic dystrophy , and several imaging findings have been described.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic foot pain is a frequent clinical complaint with approximately 14% to 42% of adults in the United States 
reporting foot problems, often with significant impact on mobility, difficulty performing daily activities , and 
increased risk of falling, particularly in older individuals [1,2] . Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a 
significant improvement in health-related quality of life with effective treatment of foot pain [3] . Estimating the 
prevalence of chron ic foot pain is challenging, because there is no consensus regarding the definition of chronic 
pain in the literature. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines chronic pain as any pain persisting 
past the normal healing time, suggesting 3 months in case of chronic pain of benign causes.  
Women are more commonly affected , and forefoot conditions are more frequent. Persistent pain for more than 6  
years has been reported in 51% of women between 70 to 75 years of age [4]. Because of  the wide range of causes 
of chronic foot pain, assessment of these patients with imaging studies in addition to a dedicated clinical 
examination is often needed [1] . 
The guidelines of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons divide heel pain into plantar heel pain,  usually 
related to pathology of the plantar fascia, and posterior heel pain,  usually related to pathology of  the Achilles tendon, 
and treatment options vary from nonoperative treatments to surgical procedures [5] . 
Chronic foot pain in children, symptoms related to soft -tissue or bone neoplasms and pain related to infectious 
conditions, inflammatory arthropathies, or other systemic diseases are beyond the scope of this document. 
Evaluation of patients with neuropathic foot or Charcot arthropathy is addressed in the ACR Appropriateness 
Criteria® topic on “ Suspected Osteomyelitis of the Foot in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus ” [6]. Posttraumatic 
entities affecting the ankle,  including instability, arthrosis, osteochondral defects, osteonecrosis, and tendinop athies,  
are discussed in  ACR Appropriateness Criteria® topic on “Chronic Ankle Pain ” [7]. Infectious and inflammatory 
arthropathies are discussed in ACR Appropriateness Criteria® topic s on “Suspected Osteomyelitis, Septic Arthritis, 
or Soft Tissue Infection (Excluding Spine and Diabetic Foot) ” [8] and “ Chronic Extremity Joint Pain –Suspected 
Inflammatory Arthritis ” [9]. Acute traumatic in juries of the foot including Lisfranc injuries are discussed in  ACR 
Appropriateness Criteria® topic on “Acute Trauma to the Foot ” [10].

early RA is proving to be the best single predictor of future disease progression and functional dete rioration, even 
compared to serologies and clinical measures [27, 28,32-34].  
US Wrist  
The diagnosis of a specific inflammatory arthritis is typically established based on clinical and laboratory 
analysis. Advanced imaging is usually performed to determine disease activity, guide management decisions, and prognosticate outcomes. In patients with RA, US  of the wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints can  show 
inflammation  as active synovitis. Identifying active synovitis with power Doppler assessment is a useful adjunct 
in making an early diagnosis of RA when a pati ent with early arthritis does not meet the 2010 criteria established 
by the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism [20]. The presence of 
synovitis predicts progression of erosions [31 ] and erosions themselves [35]. US can also depict small bone 
erosions with high spatial resolution; h owever, US is less sensitive to erosions that occur on the radial or ulnar 
sides of the inner carpal bones because direct scanning of these regions is blocked, unlike the dorsal and volar 
bone surfaces. Furthermore, unlike MRI, US cannot show changes within the bone marrow, which are  the 
strongest prognosticator s for disease progression in RA [27, 28,32-34].  In patients with established inflammatory 
arthritis who are undergoing therapy, judging progression or reduction of synovitis may be more difficult with 
sequential US compared to sequential MRI.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
MR arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected inflammatory 
arthritides. 
CT Wrist  
While CT is more sensitive than radiographs for erosions, CT is not routinely used for the diagnosis and 
management of patients with suspected inflammatory arthritides . 
CT Arthrography  Wrist  
CT arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected inflammatory 
arthritides. 
Bone Scan  Wrist  
Bone scan does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients  with suspected inflammatory 
arthritides. 
Arthrography  Wrist  
Radiographic arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected 
inflammatory arthritides. 
Variant 4: Chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or show nonspecific ar thritis. Exclude infection. Next 
study. 
Aspiration  Wrist  
No literature directly addresses the appropriateness of imaging studies beyond radiographs in patients with 
suspected infection in the wrist. However, generalizing from experience with septic arthrit is in other joints, joint 
aspiration should not be delayed in order to obtain advanced imaging studies. In cases of suspected septic arthritis, 
percutaneous aspiration of the wrist is indicated, even when radiographs appear normal. Aspirates should be 
analyzed by cell count, gram stain, and appropriate cultures. Microscopic crystal analysis should also be obtained 
if there is a possibility of gout, acute pseudogout, or hydroxyapatite deposition disease. Aspiration can be 
performed without imaging guidance i f the joint is distended, but either fluoroscopy or US  may be useful if a 
specific compartment is to be targeted.  
MRI Wrist  
There may be a role for MRI with IV contrast enhancement in the staging of infections (for example, to delineate the location and extent of soft-tissue abscesses)  after aspiration has been performed.  Especially in chronic cases, 
MRI with IV contrast may be useful to identify a fluid collection or joint effusion to target  for aspiration.  
However, MRI is usually not appropriate as the next study after radiographs for suspected wrist infections.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
MR arthrography is not routinely used to evaluate suspected wrist infection.

pathologic,  and imaging  similarities. Thus , a uniform  approach  in the imaging  workup of these entities  is reasonable.  
Features of osseous erosions  and soft tissue findings  of synovitis  and tenosynovitis  may be seen in both seropositive  
and seronegative inflammatory  arthritis, whereas enthesitis  and dactylitis  are typically  seen only with the 
spondyloarthritis .

it can detect  inflammation  and predict  cortical  erosions  [9,14] . There  is insufficient evidence to support  routine  use

can show  bony erosions  and productive  changes with high diagnostic  confidence , the ability  of CT to identify  and 
characterize associated  inflammatory  soft tissue findings  and bone  marrow  edema is limited. Newer  techniques  of 
iodine -dual -energy CT (DECT ) mapping and high-resolution  peripheral  quantitative  CT have  shown  promise  in 
detection  and quantification  of periarticular/tenosynovial  inflammation  and bony  changes  respectively  [15]. Further

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic foot pain is a frequent clinical complaint with approximately 14% to 42% of adults in the United States 
reporting foot problems, often with significant impact on mobility, difficulty performing daily activities , and 
increased risk of falling, particularly in older individuals [1,2] . Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a 
significant improvement in health-related quality of life with effective treatment of foot pain [3] . Estimating the 
prevalence of chron ic foot pain is challenging, because there is no consensus regarding the definition of chronic 
pain in the literature. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines chronic pain as any pain persisting 
past the normal healing time, suggesting 3 months in case of chronic pain of benign causes.  
Women are more commonly affected , and forefoot conditions are more frequent. Persistent pain for more than 6  
years has been reported in 51% of women between 70 to 75 years of age [4]. Because of  the wide range of causes 
of chronic foot pain, assessment of these patients with imaging studies in addition to a dedicated clinical 
examination is often needed [1] . 
The guidelines of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons divide heel pain into plantar heel pain,  usually 
related to pathology of the plantar fascia, and posterior heel pain,  usually related to pathology of  the Achilles tendon, 
and treatment options vary from nonoperative treatments to surgical procedures [5] . 
Chronic foot pain in children, symptoms related to soft -tissue or bone neoplasms and pain related to infectious 
conditions, inflammatory arthropathies, or other systemic diseases are beyond the scope of this document. 
Evaluation of patients with neuropathic foot or Charcot arthropathy is addressed in the ACR Appropriateness 
Criteria® topic on “ Suspected Osteomyelitis of the Foot in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus ” [6]. Posttraumatic 
entities affecting the ankle,  including instability, arthrosis, osteochondral defects, osteonecrosis, and tendinop athies,  
are discussed in  ACR Appropriateness Criteria® topic on “Chronic Ankle Pain ” [7]. Infectious and inflammatory 
arthropathies are discussed in ACR Appropriateness Criteria® topic s on “Suspected Osteomyelitis, Septic Arthritis, 
or Soft Tissue Infection (Excluding Spine and Diabetic Foot) ” [8] and “ Chronic Extremity Joint Pain –Suspected 
Inflammatory Arthritis ” [9]. Acute traumatic in juries of the foot including Lisfranc injuries are discussed in  ACR 
Appropriateness Criteria® topic on “Acute Trauma to the Foot ” [10].

MRI allows the visualization of bone marrow edema patterns, which improve s the detection of fractures in cases of 
negative or inconclusive radiographs [70] . The utility of MRI in the detection of radiographically occult Chopart 
fractures has been demonstrated by Almeida et al [64] . Baker et al [71]  analyzed 31 occult fractures involving the 
ankle and foot in h ockey players,  finding five occult fractures in the foot, all of which involved the navicular bone. 
Pierre -Jerome et al [72] found 79% of cuboid fractures in the diabetic population that were radiographically occult 
using MRI. MRI is also useful in the detection of occult fractures involving the fifth metatarsal bone (Jones fracture) 
and the subtalar join t [65,73] . There is no evidence in the literature supporting the routine use of contrast in the 
diagnosi s of occult fractures.  
MRI has replaced bone scans in the evaluation of symptomatic accessory ossicles. MRI allows optimal visualization 
of the bone marrow within the ossicle and visualization of the synchondrosis. Accessory ossicles may also be 
associated  with tendon pathology, which is also well assessed on MRI [74]. MRI allows clear demonstration of the 
findings often associated with posterior ankle impingement syndrome [75]. Contrast administration is not routinely 
performed when assessing symptomatic accessory ossicles on MRI; however, contrast within a disrupted 
synchondrosis may be demonstrated on MR arthrography stu dies [69]. 
US Foot   
Although not routinely performed, previous studies have demonstrated the role of US in the detection of occult foot 
fractures. On US, these can be seen as cortical irregularities and are frequently associated with soft -tissue injury in 
the acute or subacute setting. Wang et al [76]  demonstrated 24 cases of radiographically occult ankle and foot 
fractures in 268 patients. Of these, foot fractures were found most frequently in the calcaneus and metatarsals, and 
less frequently in the navicular, cuboid , and cuneiform bones.  
On US, several findings have been reported in cases of painful accessory ossicles, including patients with posterior 
ankle impingement syndrome ; however , optimal characterization of the synchondrosis is difficult on US [62] . High -
resolution US offers some advantages over other imagin g modalities because it allows dynamic exploration of the 
foot with further assessment of stability of the synchondrosis and tendon tears when present as well as direct clinical 
correlation and comparative evaluation with the asymptomatic foot [77] . Power Doppler US has proven useful in 
identifying increased blood supply in the setting of ankle impingement [78,79] . 
Variant 6: Chronic foot pain. Entrapment s yndromes. Radiographs negative or equivocal. Clinical concern 
includes Baxter’s neuropathy. Next imaging study.  
Bone Scan Foot with SPECT/CT  
There is no relevant  literature supporting the use of nuclear medicine studies in the diagnosis of Baxter’s neuropathy.  
CT Foot  
There is no relevant literature supporting the use of CT , either with or without contrast in the diagnosis of Baxter’s  
neuropathy.  
MRI Foot  
Compression of the infe rior calcaneal nerve or Baxter’s neuropathy manifests as denervation changes of the 
abductor digiti minimi muscle. Because of  its ability to demonstrate signal intensity changes in the presence of 
muscle denervation, MRI has been sho wn to be useful in the dia gnosis of patients with Baxter’s neuropathy and in 
the exclusion of other causes of foot pain [23] . However, fatty atrophy of the abductor digiti minimi muscle is not 
a specific sign of Baxter’s neuropathy and can be found in 4% of asymptomatic subjects [80]. Contrast 
administration is not routinely performed in the initial assessment of neuropathic syndromes.  
US Foot  
Compression of the infe rior calcaneal nerve or Baxter’s neuropathy due to calcaneal enthesophytes, plantar fasciitis,  
or varices can result in heel pain.

Variant 1: Chronic foot pain. Unknown etiology. Initial imaging.  
Bone Scan Foot

evaluation of chronic foot pain.  
CT Foot  
There is no relevant literature to support the use of CT as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot

MRI Foot  
There is no r elevant literature  to support the use of MRI as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot

Radiography Foot  
Conventional radiography can be useful to distinguish among different causes of chronic foot pain and is usually 
the first imag ing study in evaluating patients with chronic foot pain.  
The value of radiographs in the diagnosis of tarsal coalitions has been extensively demonstrated. Overall 
sensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs 
in the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral 
and oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar 
coalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs 
on the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have 
been found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable 
methods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  
Radiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review 
by Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for 
radiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.  
Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  
usually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, 
osteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite 
versus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess 
with radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton’s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other 
causes of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg’s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals 
or soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . 
Though radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in 
patients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The 
combination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a 
specificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15]. 
US Foot  
Ultrasound (US) is usually not indicate d as the first imaging  study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain, but may 
be performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of pathologic conditions of the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, 
and other conditions such as tarsal tunnel syndrome, Morton’s  neuroma , plantar plate tears,  and intermetatarsal 
bursitis. 
Variant 2: Persistent posttraumatic foot pain. Radiographs negative or equivocal. Clinical concern includes 
complex regional pain syndrome type I. Next imaging study.  
3-Phase Bone Scan Foot  
A 3-phase bone scan may be useful in cases of suspected complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type I reflex 
sympathetic dystrophy , and several imaging findings have been described.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 6 Chronic Foot Pain  nontumoral conditions affecting the h allucal sesamoids;  however , it could be useful to distinguish between 
sesamoiditis and avascular necrosis [32,33] . 
The most commonly used imaging techniques in the diagnosis of Morton’s  neuroma  are MRI and US. It has been 
shown that MRI has a significant effect in the diagnostic and therapeutic decisions made by orthopedic surgeons 
thanks to an increase in their confidence levels and change in treatment [34] . MRI is believed to be a sensitive and 
reliable method to evaluate patients with metatarsalgia and Morton’s  neuroma  with a sensitivity of 87%, specificity 
of 100%, accuracy of 89%, PPV of 100% , and NPV of 60% in surgically treated patients [35] . In a meta- analysis,  
MRI had  a pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio , and negative likelihood ratio of 93%, 68%, 1.89,  
and 0.19, respectively [36]. Increased fluid within the intermetatarsal bursa, which suggest s bursitis, is well 
demonstrated on MRI [37] . Although the use of gadolinium does not seem essential to detect Morton’s  neuroma s 
[38], it may facilitate its detection  because of  the improved soft -tissue contrast [32,39] . 
MRI is widely accepted as the imaging study  of choice for diagnosis of plantar plate tears. In a prospective study, 
Sung et al [40] found high accuracy (96%), sensitivity (95%), specificity (100%), PPV (100%), and NPV (67%) for 
MRI with surgical correlation. In this study,  moderate concordance was found between tear severity on MR I and 
surgery with greater concordance at higher severity. A meta-analysis showed higher diagnostic accuracy for MRI 
than US for the detection of plantar plate tears with sensitivity and specificity for MRI of 95% and 54%, respectively 
[41]. MR arthrography improves visualization of pericapsular structures when compared to conventional MRI and 
therefore is useful in the diagnosis and characterization of planta r plate tears and abnormalities of related structures 
[42,43] . 
MRI may be helpful to diagnose Freiberg’s infraction and several nonspecific findings have been described in early 
and chronic stages [32,44] . There is no evidence in the literature suppor ting the routine use of contrast in the setting 
of avascular necrosis [45]. 
US Foot  
There is limited information available in the literature regarding the use of US in the diagnosis of sesamoiditis. US 
has been shown to be useful  in diagnosing tears of the sesamoid phalangeal ligament in the setting of t urf toe [46] . 
Morton’s  neuroma  and fluid-filled intermetatarsal bursae can be demonstrated on US. High -resolution US can 
approach the sensitivity of MRI in detecting Morton’s  neuroma s. Similar to MRI, US is considered a reliable method 
to evaluate patients with Morton’s  neuroma . US has the advantage of allowing clinical correlation during 
examination. High sensitivities for US and MRI (83% –96% and 82% –96%, respectively) with no significant 
differences between the two modalities were found in a meta- analysis [36]. Other authors have found higher 
diagnostic capabilities of US over MRI in the diagnosis of Morton’s  neuroma  with pooled sensitivity, specificity, 
positive likeli hood ratio,  and negative likelihood ratio of 90%, 88%, 2.77,  and 0.16 for US and 93%, 68%, 1.89,  
and 0.19 for MRI [47] . 
MRI is generally better , but US is also useful in the diagnosis of plantar plate tears. In a cadaveric study, an accuracy, 
sensitivity , and specificity of 79%, 78% , and 80% , respectively , were found for US [48]. With MRI as the reference 
standard, Gregg et al [49]  showed a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV , and accuracy of 91%, 44%, 93%, 35% , and 
85%, respectively , for US in the detection of metatarsophalangeal plantar plate tears in symptomatic subjects.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 7 Chronic Foot Pain  CT Foot  
There is no relevant literature  to support the routine use of CT in the evaluation of a patient with clinical suspicion 
of pathology of the plantar fascia.  
MRI Foot  
MRI allows accurate characterization of the pl antar fascia and adjacent soft -tissues and bones, and several imaging 
findin gs have been described in patients with plantar fasciitis and partial or complete tears of the plantar fascia on 
MRI [52]. Given that, some of the find ings in patients with plantar fasciitis are nonspecific; these findings can also 
be seen in asymptomatic patients.  MRI should always be correlated with clinical symptoms to avoid overcalling 
plantar fasciitis. Although no significant differences have been found in plantar fascia thickness on US and MRI, 
MRI is currently considered the most sensitive imaging study  in the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis [53]. There is no 
relevant literature supporting the routine use of contrast in the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis or tears.  
US Foot  
US has shown good sensitivity (80%) and specificity (88%) in the dia gnosis of plantar fasciitis when compared to 
MRI [54]. A diagnostic accuracy of 69% for abnormal focal echogenicity within the plantar fascia, 60% for edema 
around the plantar fascia, 78% for perifascial edema, 69% for rupture of the plantar fascia,  and 56% for an associated 
calcaneal spur have been found for US, using MRI as the reference standard [55]. Kapoor et al [56]  showed higher 
sensitivity and specificity of US elastography when compared to US in the detection of plantar fasciitis (95% and 
100% versus 66% and 75%, respectively) , using  MRI as the reference standard. US has been shown to be useful in 
the diagnosis of complete and partial tears of the plantar fascia [57]. Some authors regard US to be superior to MRI 
in differentiating true fiber interruption and tearing of the plantar fascia from edema [58]. 
Variant 5: Nonradiating chronic midfoo t pain of suspected osseous origin. Radiographs negative or 
equivocal. Clinical concern includes occult fracture, or painful accessory ossicles. Next imaging study.  
Bone Scan Foot  
Bone scintigraphy is a sensitive but not specific technique to detect occult  fractures because of  its capability to 
detect increased osteoblastic activity. Although bone scans may reveal focal uptake at the site of a radiographically 
occult fracture, given the anatomical complexity of the foot particularly the midfoot, precise localization may be 
limited [59]. SPECT/CT may improve the diagnosis of patients with suspected fractures because of the more precise 
anatomical localization [60].  
Symptomatic accessory navicular bones were initially studied with Tc-99m -MDP bone scans and were repo rted to 
show increased radiotracer uptake at the synchondrosis,  apparently  due to the chronic stress reaction [61] . A 
negative bone scan can exclude the presence of a symptomatic accessory ossicle, but positive findings lack 
specificity [62]. Isotope bone scans , when combined with CT , may be positive in cases of painful accessory ossicles 
but remain rel ative ly insensitive for some soft -tissue pathology [63].  
CT Foot  
CT is useful for the detection of radiographically occult fractures. Almeida et al [64]  reported visualization of 
Chopart fractures on  CT and/or MRI in one -third of cases initially not diagnosed on radiographs . CT also has utility 
in the diagnosis of occult fractures involving the subtalar joint as demonstrated in the study by Choi et al [6 5]. CT 
is a primary imaging technique in patients with high-energy polytrauma and complex fractures, because radiographs 
have only poor to moderate sensitivity  in this clinical setting [66] . More recently, dual -energy CT has been reported 
as a useful technique in the detection of bone marrow edema , with excellent performance in the appendicular 
skeleton, with a sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 93% [67]. This could potentially aid in the detection of 
radiographically occult fractures.",False

MRI is widely accepted as the imaging study  of choice for diagnosis of plantar plate tears. In a prospective study, 
Sung et al [40] found high accuracy (96%), sensitivity (95%), specificity (100%), PPV (100%), and NPV (67%) for 
MRI with surgical correlation. In this study,  moderate concordance was found between tear severity on MR I and 
surgery with greater concordance at higher severity. A meta-analysis showed higher diagnostic accuracy for MRI 
than US for the detection of plantar plate tears with sensitivity and specificity for MRI of 95% and 54%, respectively 
[41]. MR arthrography improves visualization of pericapsular structures when compared to conventional MRI and 
therefore is useful in the diagnosis and characterization of planta r plate tears and abnormalities of related structures 
[42,43] . 
MRI may be helpful to diagnose Freiberg’s infraction and several nonspecific findings have been described in early 
and chronic stages [32,44] . There is no evidence in the literature suppor ting the routine use of contrast in the setting 
of avascular necrosis [45]. 
US Foot  
There is limited information available in the literature regarding the use of US in the diagnosis of sesamoiditis. US 
has been shown to be useful  in diagnosing tears of the sesamoid phalangeal ligament in the setting of t urf toe [46] . 
Morton’s  neuroma  and fluid-filled intermetatarsal bursae can be demonstrated on US. High -resolution US can 
approach the sensitivity of MRI in detecting Morton’s  neuroma s. Similar to MRI, US is considered a reliable method 
to evaluate patients with Morton’s  neuroma . US has the advantage of allowing clinical correlation during 
examination. High sensitivities for US and MRI (83% –96% and 82% –96%, respectively) with no significant 
differences between the two modalities were found in a meta- analysis [36]. Other authors have found higher 
diagnostic capabilities of US over MRI in the diagnosis of Morton’s  neuroma  with pooled sensitivity, specificity, 
positive likeli hood ratio,  and negative likelihood ratio of 90%, 88%, 2.77,  and 0.16 for US and 93%, 68%, 1.89,  
and 0.19 for MRI [47] . 
MRI is generally better , but US is also useful in the diagnosis of plantar plate tears. In a cadaveric study, an accuracy, 
sensitivity , and specificity of 79%, 78% , and 80% , respectively , were found for US [48]. With MRI as the reference 
standard, Gregg et al [49]  showed a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV , and accuracy of 91%, 44%, 93%, 35% , and 
85%, respectively , for US in the detection of metatarsophalangeal plantar plate tears in symptomatic subjects.

There is no relevant literature  to support the routine use of CT in the evaluation of a patient with clinical suspicion 
of pathology of the plantar fascia.  
MRI Foot  
MRI allows accurate characterization of the pl antar fascia and adjacent soft -tissues and bones, and several imaging 
findin gs have been described in patients with plantar fasciitis and partial or complete tears of the plantar fascia on 
MRI [52]. Given that, some of the find ings in patients with plantar fasciitis are nonspecific; these findings can also 
be seen in asymptomatic patients.  MRI should always be correlated with clinical symptoms to avoid overcalling 
plantar fasciitis. Although no significant differences have been found in plantar fascia thickness on US and MRI, 
MRI is currently considered the most sensitive imaging study  in the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis [53]. There is no 
relevant literature supporting the routine use of contrast in the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis or tears.  
US Foot  
US has shown good sensitivity (80%) and specificity (88%) in the dia gnosis of plantar fasciitis when compared to 
MRI [54]. A diagnostic accuracy of 69% for abnormal focal echogenicity within the plantar fascia, 60% for edema 
around the plantar fascia, 78% for perifascial edema, 69% for rupture of the plantar fascia,  and 56% for an associated 
calcaneal spur have been found for US, using MRI as the reference standard [55]. Kapoor et al [56]  showed higher 
sensitivity and specificity of US elastography when compared to US in the detection of plantar fasciitis (95% and 
100% versus 66% and 75%, respectively) , using  MRI as the reference standard. US has been shown to be useful in 
the diagnosis of complete and partial tears of the plantar fascia [57]. Some authors regard US to be superior to MRI 
in differentiating true fiber interruption and tearing of the plantar fascia from edema [58]. 
Variant 5: Nonradiating chronic midfoo t pain of suspected osseous origin. Radiographs negative or 
equivocal. Clinical concern includes occult fracture, or painful accessory ossicles. Next imaging study.  
Bone Scan Foot  
Bone scintigraphy is a sensitive but not specific technique to detect occult  fractures because of  its capability to 
detect increased osteoblastic activity. Although bone scans may reveal focal uptake at the site of a radiographically 
occult fracture, given the anatomical complexity of the foot particularly the midfoot, precise localization may be 
limited [59]. SPECT/CT may improve the diagnosis of patients with suspected fractures because of the more precise 
anatomical localization [60].  
Symptomatic accessory navicular bones were initially studied with Tc-99m -MDP bone scans and were repo rted to 
show increased radiotracer uptake at the synchondrosis,  apparently  due to the chronic stress reaction [61] . A 
negative bone scan can exclude the presence of a symptomatic accessory ossicle, but positive findings lack 
specificity [62]. Isotope bone scans , when combined with CT , may be positive in cases of painful accessory ossicles 
but remain rel ative ly insensitive for some soft -tissue pathology [63].  
CT Foot  
CT is useful for the detection of radiographically occult fractures. Almeida et al [64]  reported visualization of 
Chopart fractures on  CT and/or MRI in one -third of cases initially not diagnosed on radiographs . CT also has utility 
in the diagnosis of occult fractures involving the subtalar joint as demonstrated in the study by Choi et al [6 5]. CT 
is a primary imaging technique in patients with high-energy polytrauma and complex fractures, because radiographs 
have only poor to moderate sensitivity  in this clinical setting [66] . More recently, dual -energy CT has been reported 
as a useful technique in the detection of bone marrow edema , with excellent performance in the appendicular 
skeleton, with a sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 93% [67]. This could potentially aid in the detection of 
radiographically occult fractures.

meta -analysis showed higher diagnostic accuracy for MRI than US for the detection of plantar plate tears. In this 
meta -analysis the sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio , and negative likelihood ratio were 93%, 33%, 
1.2, and 0.35 , respectively , for US  [41]. 
Variant 4: Chronic plantar heel pain. Radiographs negative or equivocal. Clinical concern includes plantar 
fasciitis or plantar fascia tear. Next imaging study.  
Bone Scan Foot with SPECT or SPECT/CT  
SPECT/CT has been found to be of use when investigating heel pain with increased specificity when compared to 
bone scintigraphy alone , because of  the improved anatomic localization of metabolic activity. Despite the anatomic 
and functional advantages of SPECT/CT, MRI and high-frequency US remain the most frequently used imaging  
modalities in patients with heel pain [50]. A characteristic p attern of abnormal uptake on 3-phase bone scintigraphy 
has been proven helpful to differentiate plantar fasciitis from calcaneal stress or avulsion fractures [51]. There is no 
relevant literature  to support the routine use of nuclear medicine studies to diagnose plantar fascia l tears.

MRI Foot  
There is no r elevant literature  to support the use of MRI as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot

Radiography Foot  
Conventional radiography can be useful to distinguish among different causes of chronic foot pain and is usually 
the first imag ing study in evaluating patients with chronic foot pain.  
The value of radiographs in the diagnosis of tarsal coalitions has been extensively demonstrated. Overall 
sensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs 
in the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral 
and oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar 
coalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs 
on the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have 
been found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable 
methods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  
Radiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review 
by Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for 
radiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.  
Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  
usually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, 
osteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite 
versus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess 
with radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton’s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other 
causes of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg’s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals 
or soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . 
Though radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in 
patients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The 
combination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a 
specificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15]. 
US Foot  
Ultrasound (US) is usually not indicate d as the first imaging  study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain, but may 
be performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of pathologic conditions of the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, 
and other conditions such as tarsal tunnel syndrome, Morton’s  neuroma , plantar plate tears,  and intermetatarsal 
bursitis.

Scan ordered:   ","1. Classification: USUALLY APPROPRIATE
2. Explanation: MRI arthrography of the right wrist is usually appropriate for assessing triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) injury. The patient presents with a 1-year history of right wrist ulnar-sided pain and reduced grip strength, with pain exacerbated by activities. On examination, the patient has a positive fovea sign and pain on ulnar deviation of the wrist. X-rays show non-specific degenerative changes in the wrist. Given these findings, MRI arthrography can accurately depict abnormalities of the bones, ligaments, TFCC, and other structures in the wrist, making it a powerful study for evaluating chronic pain caused by diverse etiologies, including TFCC injury.
3. Recommendation: NO CHANGE REQUIRED",USUALLY APPROPRIATE,MRI arthrography wrist,"Guideline: ACR chronic hand and wrist pain.pdf, Page: 8
Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 8 Chronic Wrist Pain  abnormalities responsible for pain when there is no ligament or TFCC abnormality. Because of these limitations, 
arthrography  has now largely been supplanted by cross-sectional imaging. Fluoroscopic -guided intra -articular 
injections are chiefly used as a first step when performing arthrographic  computed tomography ( CT) and 
magnetic resonance imaging (MR I) studies [8]. 
MRI  
Wrist MRI accurately depicts abnormalities of the bones and bone marrow, articular cartilage, intrinsic and 
extrinsic ligaments, TFCC, synovium, tendons, and neurovascular structures, making it a powerful study for 
chronic pai n caused by diverse etiologies.  
A dedicated receiver coil or transmit -receive coil is necessary to provide the signal -to-noise ratio needed for high-
resolution, high-contrast MRI of the wrist [9 ]. MR arthrography —either with direct contrast injection into one  or 
more wrist compartments or performed indirectly after intravenous (IV) contrast administration —can enhance the 
yield of the study for diagnosing internal wrist derangements, especially abnormalities of the ligaments, articular cartilage, and TFCC of the wrist. MRI performed with a 3.0 T magnet and a dedicated coil provides better signal -
to-noise ratio and better contrast compared with wrist MR I performed with 1.5 T  or lower field strength systems 
[10,11]. 
CT 
CT of the wr ist is used primarily when high-det ail imaging of bone cortex or trabeculae is needed. In patients with 
chronic wrist pain and prior fractures, CT is typically the study of choice to evaluate fracture healing and joint 
congruence. When a radiographically occult fracture is suspected as the cause of a patient’s chronic pain, either 
CT or MRI can be used [12]. Advantages of CT over MRI for the wrist include  its ability to obtain high -resolution 
images of both wrists simultaneously and the much shorter acquisition times for CT. These factors make CT the 
preferred examination for suspected distal radioulnar joint subluxation, where images of both wrists can be  
obtained in both supination and pronation [1 ,13]. A disadvantage of CT  is its lower sensitivity to soft -tissue 
abnormalities  compared with MRI.  
High-resolution (typically multidetector) CT of the wrist following contrast injection into one or more wrist 
compartments (CT arthrography) is a powerful tool for diagnosing intra -articular abnormalities [14,15]. The 
intraobserver agreement on CT arthrogram images is extremely high and better than that reported for MRI 
[14,16]. 
US 
US of the wrist is useful for examining extra -articular soft tissues, such as suspected ganglion cyst s [17], because 
its accuracy is similar to that of MRI. US can also be used to diagnose abnormalities of the flexor and extensor 
tendons and tendon sheaths. For de Quervain disease (stenosing tenosynovitis of the abductor pollicis lon gus and 
extensor pollicis brevis tendon compartment), preoperative identification of a septum or subcompartmentalization 
within the first dorsal compartment with US  may affect surgical management [18 ,19]. 
In patients with suspected or established rheumatoid arthritis (RA), US examination of the wrist and selected 
finger joints can identify erosions and active synovit is (with the use of power Doppler), findings that influence 
early diagnosis and treatment decisions [20]. Using US to measure the size of the median nerve is a  validated  
technique in patients with clinical symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome [21-24].  
In addition, w rist US is a useful technique to guide therapeutic intr a-articular and other soft -tissue injections [25].

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
In patients with chronic wrist pain, imaging studies are  an important adjunct to history, physical examination, 
laboratory testing, and electrophysiology studies. The choice of imaging modality depends on the patient’s 
presentation and the clinical questions being asked. There are scenarios in which no imaging beyond baseline 
radiographs is necessary, but in other situations advanced imaging has added value for diagnostic eva luation and 
treatment planning.  
Overview of Imaging Modalities  
Radiographs  
Imaging evaluation of the painful wrist should begin with radiog raphs [1,2]. This simple study may establish a 
specific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, 
impaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -
anterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or 
more oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling 
[3]. A v ariety of stress positions and maneuvers can be performed to elicit dynamic instability that is not visible 
on standard radiographs [ 4]. Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. 
Additionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ]. 
In the past , fluoroscopic observation was used to establish the diagnosis of dynamic wrist inst ability. However, in 
most practices,  fluoroscopy is used either for g uidance during wrist injections  or as an adjunct to arthrography.  
Percutaneous aspiration of the wrist —which is indicated in cases of suspected septic arthritis or to assess for intra-
articular crystals—can be carried out with either fluoroscopic or ultrasound (US) guidance  if needed . 
Scintigraphy  
Bone scintigraphy has been used for diagnosing occult wrist fractures and as a screening procedure in patients 
with wrist pain and negative radi ographs. However, while it is sensitive to bone abnormalities, scintigraphy 
suffers from a lack of specificity [6 ]. Furthermore, bone scans cannot detect soft -tissue abnormalities  such as  
lesions of the ligaments, tendons, and cartilage, all of which are often responsible for chronic wrist pain.  
Arthrography  
Conventional (x-ray) arthrography can be performed with contrast injection into the radiocarpal joint al one or into 
the radiocarpal, mi dcarpal, and distal radioulnar joints ( 3-phase technique) for the diagnosis of triangular 
fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tear and intrinsic ligament perforations. A recent meta -analysis found only 
moderate pooled sensitivity (76%) for the detection of full -thickness TFCC tears (82% for 3 -phase technique and 
72% for single -injection arthrograms)  [7]. However, arthrography is unable to reliably show the size, shape, and 
stability of TFCC defects and is insensitive to partial-thickness tears.

While CT with IV contrast enhancement can depict abscesses, it is usually not appropriate  for evaluation of 
suspected wrist infections.  
CT Arthrography  Wrist  
CT arthrography is not routinely used to eval uate suspected wrist infection.  
US Wrist  
There may be a role for US in the staging of infections (for example, to delineate the location and e xtent of soft -
tissue abscesses) after aspiration has been performed.  Alternatively, US may be used in conjunction with 
aspiration as a method to first identify collections and then as the imaging method to guide aspiration.

Arthrography  Wrist  
Radiographic arthrography  is not routinely used to eval uate suspected wrist infection.  
Variant 5:  Ulnar -sided chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or nonspecific . Next study.  
MRI Wrist  
Both traumatic and degenerative lesions of the TFCC can produce chronic, ulnar -sided wrist pain . MRI is highly 
accurate for lesions involving the radial (central) zone of the disc, especially with the use of high -resolution fast 
spin-echo or 3-D grad ient-recalled pulse sequences [36]. There is some evidence suggesting that MRI performed 
with a 3.0 T system is even more accurate than MRI performed with a 1.5 T system for TFCC lesions [37], but 
there are no studies comparing the accuracy of the two field s trengths in the same patients. The sensitivity for 
tears of the ulnar attachment of the disc and the peripheral attachments (the ulnocarpal ligaments) are only fair 
with noncontrast -enhanced wrist MRI [ 12,36]. IV contrast seldom provides added benefit in patients with ulnar -
sided wrist pain but may increase sensitivity for TFCC lesions if MR arthrography is desired but direct joint 
injection is not feasible. 
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
Direct MR arthrography (performed with contrast injection of the radiocarpal or distal radioulnar compartments, 
alone or in combination) does result in better diagnostic accuracy for the T FCC compared with conventional MRI, 
especially for ulnar -sided lesions [26, 38], even when compared to conventio nal MRI performed with a 3.0 T 
magnet [7,8,39]. The same is true for intrinsic ligament injuries, such as those of the lunotriquetral ligament, 
which can produce ulnar -sided pain [7 ,8,39]. Performing either MR arthrography or noncontrast -enhanced MRI is 
usually appropriate in this scenario.  
CT Arthrography  Wrist  
The accuracy of CT arthrography is superior to MRI  and similar to that  of MR arthrography for TFCC and 
intrinsic ligament lesions [8,40]. In addition, CT arthrography appears to be mor e accurate than either MRI or  MR 
arthrography for identifying articular cartilage defects in the wrist [38]. In contrast to MRI and MR arthrography, 
CT arthrography is less sensitive to lesions occurring outside of the joint (like abnormalities of the extensor carpi 
ulnaris tendon) that can result in ulnar -sided pain.  For these reasons, CT arthrography may be appropriate in this 
setting , especially if there is a contraindication to MRI or if artifact from metallic implants produce too much 
artifact on MRI.

3. Recommendation:
Classification: May be appropriate
Explanation: Both US wrist and MRI wrist without IV contrast are considered appropriate initial examinations for evaluating carpal tunnel syndrome. US wrist is useful for examining extra-articular soft tissues, such as suspected ganglion cysts, with similar accuracy to MRI. MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in cases where the initial evaluation is equivocal.

both the flexor and extensor wrist compartments [46]. Occult ganglion cysts are also easily identified with MRI, 
but some authors recommend use of IV contrast to distinguish ganglia from synovitis [ 47]. For noncystic soft-
tissue masses, MRI may demonstrate findings that are diagnostic for certain benign conditions (eg, lipomas, 
hemangiomas, benign nerve sheath tumors), and can stage the extent of involvement for nonspecific masses ( see 
the ACR Appropriateness Criteria® topic on “ Soft-Tissue Masses ” [48]). 
US Wrist  
Wrist US or MRI (without or without  and with IV contrast) are alternative initial examinations that are usually 
appropriate in this setting. US  is useful for examining extra -articular soft tissue s, such as suspected ganglion cysts 
[17],  with an accuracy similar to that  of MRI.  
CT Wrist  
There is no support in the literature for CT in the initial diagnosis of a palpable mass or suspected ganglion cyst 
with normal or nonspecific radiologic findings. CT may have a role in cases in which calcification or ossification 
is demo nstrated radiologically, or in the staging of a lesion that is first evaluated by MRI or US , but CT with or 
without IV contrast are usually not appropriate initial examinations for a suspected soft -tissue mass.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
MR arthrography is not routinely used to evaluate a palpable mass or ganglion cyst.  
CT Arthrography  Wrist  
CT arthrography is not routinely used to evaluate a palpable mass or ganglion cyst.  
Bone Scan  Wrist

Variant 10: Chronic wrist pain. Suspect occult fracture or stress fracture. Radiographs nondiagnostic. 
Next study.  
MRI Wrist  
Either MRI without I V contrast or CT without IV contrast is usually appropriate in this scenario. MRI is highly 
sensitive to changes in bone marrow composition, and thus is frequently used to identify radiographically occult 
acute fractures throughout the skeleton, including in the wrist (see the ACR Appropriateness Criteria® topic on 
“Acute Hand and Wrist Trauma” [49]). In patients with persistent symptoms thought to be due to an occult wrist 
fracture, MRI can be used as an alternative to presumptive casting and repeat radiographs [ 12]. MRI is also 
sensitive to stress fractures and stress injuries of the physes, for example, in gymnasts [50].  IV contrast does not 
add to the examination and is usually not appropriate.  
CT Wrist  
Either CT without IV contrast or MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate in this scenario. CT can provide high-detail imaging of bone cortex a nd trabeculae and thus can be used to identify radiographically occult  
fractures and stress fractures. Acquisition times are shorter for CT compared to MRI, and CT may be easier to 
perform in patients who are casted. However, MRI’s sensitivity for bone bru ises and soft -tissue injuries is greater 
than CT. In specific circumstances—like suspected fractures of the hook of the hamate— CT may be preferable to 
MRI.  IV contrast does not add to the examination and is usually not appropriate.  
Radiography Wrist  
If not  obtained as part of the initial radiographic series, additional views such as a carpal tunnel or semipronated 
oblique projection  (a “scaphoid view”) may show an otherwise radiographically  occult fracture, and may be 
appropriate . 
Bone Scan  Wrist  
Bone scans are frequently positive for occult fractures by the time of clinical presentation , typically  1 to 2 weeks 
before radiographs.

Once a scaphoid fracture is identified, Radiographic arthrography does not contribute to the evaluation for 
complications of the fracture.  
Variant 12: Chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or nonspecific. Suspect carpal tunnel syndrome.  Next 
study. 
US Wrist 
Several meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the 
carpal  tunnel  inlet) is highly accurate for identifying carpal  tunnel syndrome  diagnosed clinically or with the 
combination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US 
varies depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the 
measurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary 
examination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel 
syndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal 
tunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, 
clinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of 
carpal tunnel syndrome. US may be appropriate in cases where this initial evaluation is equivocal.  
MRI Wrist  
Historically, carpal tunnel syndrome has been diagnosed based on clinical signs and sympt oms and confirmed by 
the results of electrodiagnostic studies [67]. MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in cases in which this  
initial evaluation is equivocal. The MRI findings that have been reported in wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome —
including nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing—may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value 
in patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68]. In rare cases of secondary carpal tunnel syndrome, MRI may identify 
a mass lesion compressing the median nerve. There is some evidence that the length of T2 hyperintensity in the 
median nerve can help prognosticate the success of surgery [69] and that the shape and signal of the nerve predict 
clinical response to a steroid injection in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome [70 ]. MR neurography 
may be an option in patients with suspected carpal tunnel syndrome.  The use o f IV contrast does not contribute to 
diagnosis and is usually not appropriate.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
MR arthrography is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.  
CT Wrist  
CT, with or without IV  contrast, is not routinely used to diagnose carpa l tunnel syndrome.

Summary of Recommendations  
• Wrist radiographs are indicated as the best initial imaging examination in patients with chronic wrist pain. 
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal and a patient has persistent symptoms wi th an unclear diagnosis, 
MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate.  
• In patients with suspected inflammatory arthritis, MRI either with or without IV contrast is usually 
appropriate if guidance for management or prognostication is needed.  
• Patients with  suspected wrist infection should undergo aspiration.  
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal in a patient with ulnar -sided pain, either MRI without IV contrast 
or an MR arthrogram of the wrist is usually appropriate.  
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal in a patient with radial -sided pain, MRI without IV contrast is 
usually appropriate.

arthrography  has now largely been supplanted by cross-sectional imaging. Fluoroscopic -guided intra -articular 
injections are chiefly used as a first step when performing arthrographic  computed tomography ( CT) and 
magnetic resonance imaging (MR I) studies [8]. 
MRI  
Wrist MRI accurately depicts abnormalities of the bones and bone marrow, articular cartilage, intrinsic and 
extrinsic ligaments, TFCC, synovium, tendons, and neurovascular structures, making it a powerful study for 
chronic pai n caused by diverse etiologies.  
A dedicated receiver coil or transmit -receive coil is necessary to provide the signal -to-noise ratio needed for high-
resolution, high-contrast MRI of the wrist [9 ]. MR arthrography —either with direct contrast injection into one  or 
more wrist compartments or performed indirectly after intravenous (IV) contrast administration —can enhance the 
yield of the study for diagnosing internal wrist derangements, especially abnormalities of the ligaments, articular cartilage, and TFCC of the wrist. MRI performed with a 3.0 T magnet and a dedicated coil provides better signal -
to-noise ratio and better contrast compared with wrist MR I performed with 1.5 T  or lower field strength systems 
[10,11]. 
CT 
CT of the wr ist is used primarily when high-det ail imaging of bone cortex or trabeculae is needed. In patients with 
chronic wrist pain and prior fractures, CT is typically the study of choice to evaluate fracture healing and joint 
congruence. When a radiographically occult fracture is suspected as the cause of a patient’s chronic pain, either 
CT or MRI can be used [12]. Advantages of CT over MRI for the wrist include  its ability to obtain high -resolution 
images of both wrists simultaneously and the much shorter acquisition times for CT. These factors make CT the 
preferred examination for suspected distal radioulnar joint subluxation, where images of both wrists can be  
obtained in both supination and pronation [1 ,13]. A disadvantage of CT  is its lower sensitivity to soft -tissue 
abnormalities  compared with MRI.  
High-resolution (typically multidetector) CT of the wrist following contrast injection into one or more wrist 
compartments (CT arthrography) is a powerful tool for diagnosing intra -articular abnormalities [14,15]. The 
intraobserver agreement on CT arthrogram images is extremely high and better than that reported for MRI 
[14,16]. 
US 
US of the wrist is useful for examining extra -articular soft tissues, such as suspected ganglion cyst s [17], because 
its accuracy is similar to that of MRI. US can also be used to diagnose abnormalities of the flexor and extensor 
tendons and tendon sheaths. For de Quervain disease (stenosing tenosynovitis of the abductor pollicis lon gus and 
extensor pollicis brevis tendon compartment), preoperative identification of a septum or subcompartmentalization 
within the first dorsal compartment with US  may affect surgical management [18 ,19]. 
In patients with suspected or established rheumatoid arthritis (RA), US examination of the wrist and selected 
finger joints can identify erosions and active synovit is (with the use of power Doppler), findings that influence 
early diagnosis and treatment decisions [20]. Using US to measure the size of the median nerve is a  validated  
technique in patients with clinical symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome [21-24].  
In addition, w rist US is a useful technique to guide therapeutic intr a-articular and other soft -tissue injections [25].

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 10 Chronic Wrist Pain  importantly, though, the finding of enhancing bone marrow “edema” (osteitis) on MRI studies in patients with 
early RA is proving to be the best single predictor of future disease progression and functional dete rioration, even 
compared to serologies and clinical measures [27, 28,32-34].  
US Wrist  
The diagnosis of a specific inflammatory arthritis is typically established based on clinical and laboratory 
analysis. Advanced imaging is usually performed to determine disease activity, guide management decisions, and prognosticate outcomes. In patients with RA, US  of the wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints can  show 
inflammation  as active synovitis. Identifying active synovitis with power Doppler assessment is a useful adjunct 
in making an early diagnosis of RA when a pati ent with early arthritis does not meet the 2010 criteria established 
by the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism [20]. The presence of 
synovitis predicts progression of erosions [31 ] and erosions themselves [35]. US can also depict small bone 
erosions with high spatial resolution; h owever, US is less sensitive to erosions that occur on the radial or ulnar 
sides of the inner carpal bones because direct scanning of these regions is blocked, unlike the dorsal and volar 
bone surfaces. Furthermore, unlike MRI, US cannot show changes within the bone marrow, which are  the 
strongest prognosticator s for disease progression in RA [27, 28,32-34].  In patients with established inflammatory 
arthritis who are undergoing therapy, judging progression or reduction of synovitis may be more difficult with 
sequential US compared to sequential MRI.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
MR arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected inflammatory 
arthritides. 
CT Wrist  
While CT is more sensitive than radiographs for erosions, CT is not routinely used for the diagnosis and

CT Arthrography  Wrist

Variant 4: Chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or show nonspecific ar thritis. Exclude infection. Next 
study. 
Aspiration  Wrist  
No literature directly addresses the appropriateness of imaging studies beyond radiographs in patients with 
suspected infection in the wrist. However, generalizing from experience with septic arthrit is in other joints, joint 
aspiration should not be delayed in order to obtain advanced imaging studies. In cases of suspected septic arthritis, 
percutaneous aspiration of the wrist is indicated, even when radiographs appear normal. Aspirates should be 
analyzed by cell count, gram stain, and appropriate cultures. Microscopic crystal analysis should also be obtained 
if there is a possibility of gout, acute pseudogout, or hydroxyapatite deposition disease. Aspiration can be 
performed without imaging guidance i f the joint is distended, but either fluoroscopy or US  may be useful if a 
specific compartment is to be targeted.  
MRI Wrist  
There may be a role for MRI with IV contrast enhancement in the staging of infections (for example, to delineate the location and extent of soft-tissue abscesses)  after aspiration has been performed.  Especially in chronic cases, 
MRI with IV contrast may be useful to identify a fluid collection or joint effusion to target  for aspiration.  
However, MRI is usually not appropriate as the next study after radiographs for suspected wrist infections.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
MR arthrography is not routinely used to evaluate suspected wrist infection.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
In patients with chronic wrist pain, imaging studies are  an important adjunct to history, physical examination, 
laboratory testing, and electrophysiology studies. The choice of imaging modality depends on the patient’s 
presentation and the clinical questions being asked. There are scenarios in which no imaging beyond baseline 
radiographs is necessary, but in other situations advanced imaging has added value for diagnostic eva luation and 
treatment planning.  
Overview of Imaging Modalities  
Radiographs  
Imaging evaluation of the painful wrist should begin with radiog raphs [1,2]. This simple study may establish a 
specific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, 
impaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -
anterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or 
more oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling 
[3]. A v ariety of stress positions and maneuvers can be performed to elicit dynamic instability that is not visible 
on standard radiographs [ 4]. Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. 
Additionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ]. 
In the past , fluoroscopic observation was used to establish the diagnosis of dynamic wrist inst ability. However, in 
most practices,  fluoroscopy is used either for g uidance during wrist injections  or as an adjunct to arthrography.  
Percutaneous aspiration of the wrist —which is indicated in cases of suspected septic arthritis or to assess for intra-
articular crystals—can be carried out with either fluoroscopic or ultrasound (US) guidance  if needed . 
Scintigraphy  
Bone scintigraphy has been used for diagnosing occult wrist fractures and as a screening procedure in patients 
with wrist pain and negative radi ographs. However, while it is sensitive to bone abnormalities, scintigraphy 
suffers from a lack of specificity [6 ]. Furthermore, bone scans cannot detect soft -tissue abnormalities  such as  
lesions of the ligaments, tendons, and cartilage, all of which are often responsible for chronic wrist pain.  
Arthrography  
Conventional (x-ray) arthrography can be performed with contrast injection into the radiocarpal joint al one or into 
the radiocarpal, mi dcarpal, and distal radioulnar joints ( 3-phase technique) for the diagnosis of triangular 
fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tear and intrinsic ligament perforations. A recent meta -analysis found only 
moderate pooled sensitivity (76%) for the detection of full -thickness TFCC tears (82% for 3 -phase technique and 
72% for single -injection arthrograms)  [7]. However, arthrography is unable to reliably show the size, shape, and 
stability of TFCC defects and is insensitive to partial-thickness tears.

Summary  of Recommendations 
• Variant 1 : Radiography pelvis and Radiography hip are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of chronic 
hip pain. These procedures are complementary (ie, more than one procedure is ordered as a set or simultaneously 
in which each procedure provides unique clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 2 : In the setting of chronic hip pain with negative or nondiagnostic radiographs, MRI hip  without IV 
contrast or US hip  is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for suspected noninfectious extra -articular 
abnormality, such as tendonitis or bursitis.  These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure 
will be ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 3 : In the setting of chronic hip pain with negative or nondiagnostic radiographs, MR arthrography hip 
or MRI hip without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for suspected impingement or 
dysplasia. These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be ordered to provide the 
clinical informatio n to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 4 : In the setting of chronic hip pain with negative or nondiagnostic radiographs, MR arthrography hip 
or MRI hip without IV contrast is usually appropriate to evaluate for a labral  tear. These procedures  are 
equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 5 : In the setting of chronic hip pain with equivocal or mild osteoarthritis by radiographs , MR 
arthr ography hip or MRI hip without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study to assess 
articular cartilage integrity. These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be ordered 
to provide the clinical information to  effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 6 : In the setting of chronic hip pain,  MRI hip without and with IV contrast or MRI hip without IV 
contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study when radiographs are suspicious for intra -articular 
synovial hyperplasia or neoplasia , including nodular synovitis, diffuse tenosynovial giant cell tumor, 
osteochondromatosis, or other synovial neoplasm . These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one 
procedure will be ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 7 : In the setting of concomitant chronic hip pain with low back or knee pathology or pain, Image -
guided anesthetic +/ - corticosteroid injection of the hip joint or surrounding st ructures is usually appropriate as 
the next imaging study to quantify the amount of pain arising from the hip when radiographs also demonstrate 
hip osteoarthritis.

knees may be obtained  as part of the hip CT to evaluate for femoral  version;  occasionally  knee  pathology may be 
identified  on these images  as a possible  cause of the patient’s  hip pain [49]. 
Fluoride  PET/CT Skull Base to Mid-Thigh 
One study demonstrated  the potential use of fluoride  PET to demonstrate increased  bone  turnover  in the setting  of 
chronic  hip pain and FAI [50]. One other  study  demonstrated  that fluoride  PET can demonstrate acetabular  
contrecoup injuries  in patients  with FAI [51]. However,  increased  radiotracer  uptake  is a nonspecific  finding,  and, 
overall,  there is insufficient  literature  to support  the use of fluoride  PET/CT skull base to mid-thigh in the evaluation  
of chronic  hip pain thought  to be due to hip impingement  and/or  dysplasia.  
Image -Guided Anesthetic +/- Corticosteroid  Injection  Hip Joint  or Surrounding  Structures  
Fluoroscopic -, CT-, or US-guided anesthetic and/or  corticosteroid  injections  can be a useful  tool for clarifying  the 
source of a patient’s  chronic  hip pain.  In addition  to intra-articular  injections, selective trochanteric  and iliopsoas  
bursal/peritendinous  injections  can be performed  for both diagnostic  or therapeutic purposes  using anesthetic and/or  
corticosteroid  injectate,  respectively.  Symptomatic  relief  following  selective injection  of particular  structure(s)  can 
help to define  the etiology  of the patient’s symptoms  and can guide  future  therapy  [19-22].

chronic  hip pain [35-37]. 
US Hip 
The literature  indicates that US is useful  for the evaluation  of extra -articular  soft tissues in the region of the hip 
[23]. US can also nicely  demo nstrate fluid  collections  around the hip, such as bursitis  and paralabral  cysts.  Tendon  
pathology,  such as tendinosis , tears,  or snapping iliopsoas tendons  can also be identified  with US [38-41]. US may 
also be useful  for the dynamic  evaluation  of the iliopsoas  tendon,  such as in snapping  hip syndrome.  
Variant  3: Chronic  hip pain. Suspect  impingement  or dysplasia . Radiographs  negative  or nondiagnostic.  
Next  imaging  study.  
Bone  Scan  Hip 
There is no relevant  literature  to support  to the use of bone  scan of the hip in the evaluation  of suspected  hip 
impingement.  
CT Arthrography  Hip 
Pathology  associated  with femoracetabular  impingement  (FAI) may be both intra- and extra-articular . CT is often  
used for preoperative assessment  of bony anatomy  in the setting  of FAI and hip dysplasia [42-44]. CT arthrography  
has been  shown  to be sensitive  for detection  of acetabular  labral  tears [17], which  may be associated  with FAI. CT 
arthrography has also been  shown  to be more  helpful  in identifying  chondral  lesions [16] when  compared  to MRI.  
However,  arthrography does not offer an advantage  over noncontrast  CT for the detection  of extra-articular  
impingement  (eg, ischiopelvic,  ischiotrochanteric,  subspinous,  and femoropelvic).  
CT Hip With  IV Contrast  
CT without  IV contrast  is often  used for preoperative  assessment  of bony anatomy  in the setting  of FAI and hip 
dysplasia [42-44]. However,  IV contrast  administration  does not confer  an additional  advantage  for evaluation  of 
hip impingement.  
CT Hip Without  and With  IV Contrast  
Noncontrast  CT is often  used for preoperative assessment  of bony  anatomy  in the setting  of FAI and hip dysplasia  
[42-44]. IV contrast  administration  is not warranted  for evaluation  of hip impingement.  
CT Hip Without  IV Contrast  
FAI is associated  with both intra- and extra-articular  pathology.  Noncontrast  CT is often  used for preoperative  
assessment  of bony  anatomy  in the setting  of FAI and hip dysplasia [42-44]. CT without  IV contrast  is not; however,  
helpful  in the assessment  of the articular  cartilage or labral  status.  Volume  rendered  3-D reconstructions  generated  
from  noncontrast  CT data are useful  for quantifying the femoral  head -neck  morphology and providing a noninvasive  
assessment  of hips at risk of FAI [62].  Some  centers evaluate the shape and contours  of the femoral  neck  by 
employing radial  imaging  or radial  reconstructions.  Software programs  can use CT data to generate virtual models  
of the hip that can detect  the presence of impingement  throughout  a hip’s  range  of motion.  CT can also be helpful  
in identifying  extra-articular  impingement  (ischiopelvic,  ischiotrochanteric,  subspinous,  and femoropelvic)  [45,46] .

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 10 Chronic  Hip Pain Radiography Hip Additional Views 
For further evaluation  of disorders  such as dysplasia or FAI, specialized  views such as the false  profile  or elongated  
femoral  neck  lateral  (Dunn)  views  can provide  more  detailed  evaluation  of the anatomy  of the femoral  head  and 
neck  and the degree of acetabular  coverage of the femoral  head  [47]. 
US Hip 
In general,  US is limited  in its use for evaluating  osseous structures.  However,  there is limited  literature  that 
demonstrates that US can be used to evaluate osseous features of FAI such as the alpha -angle  [73]. However,  US is 
not able to adequately  evaluate osseous abnormalities  deep  to the cortex.  One of the advantages  of US is its ability  
to dynamically  evaluate for extra-articular  soft tissue  impingement.  US is not as sensitive as MRI or CT 
arthrography  for the detection  of labral  tears  [17], but it can be useful  for the detection  and localization  of paralabral  
cysts for aspiration  and injection  [39,41] . 
Variant  4: Chronic  hip pain. Suspect  labral tear.  Radiographs  negative  or nondiagnostic. Next  imaging  
study. 
Bone  Scan  Hip 
There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of bone  scan of the hip for the workup of an acetabular  labral  tear 
in a patient  with chronic  hip pain.  
CT Arthrography  Hip 
Some  authors  have  shown  that CT arthrography  can be useful  in the detection  of acetabular  labral  tears [17,74] , 
which  may be associated  with FAI, but other  authors  have  shown  that CT arthrography is not very good for the 
detection  of labral  tears [18].  
CT Hip With  IV Contrast  
There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of CT hip with IV contrast  for the workup  of an acetabular  labral  
tear in a patient  with chronic  hip pain.  
CT Hip Without  and With  IV Contrast  
There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of CT hip without and with IV contrast  for the workup  of an 
acetabular  labral  tear in a patient  with chronic  hip pain.  
CT Hip Without  IV Contrast  
Because of  its inherent  poor contrast  resolution,  there  is no relevant  literature  support ing the use of CT hip without  
IV contrast  for the workup of an acetabular  labral  tear in a patient  with chronic  hip pain.  
Fluoride  PET/CT Skull Base to Mid-Thigh 
There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of fluoride  PET/CT skull base to mid-thigh in the evaluation  of 
chronic  hip pain thought  to be due to a labral  tear. 
Image -Guided Anesthetic +/- Corticosteroid  Injection  Hip Joint  or Surrounding  Structures  
Diagnostic joint injections  are safe and useful  tools  for confirming  the etiology  of pain, such as a labral  tear or 
symptomatic  paralabral  cyst [20-22]. 
MR Arthrography  Hip 
Direct  MR arthrography,  with the intraarticular  injection  of a 1:200 solution  of gadolinium  chelate in saline,  has 
been  established  as a reliable  technique  for diagnosing acetabular  labral  tears [75-80]  that are frequently  associated  
with FAI [81,82] . MR arthrography has been  shown  to have  a sensitivity  of 94.5%  and a specificity  of 100%  for 
the detection  of labral  tears [52].

pathology because of  the inherent  poor soft tissue contrast  of CT. Within  the limitation  of CT; however,  some  extra-

Radiography Hip 
The literature  indicates that radiography  is a first-line screening  tool, and hip radiographs  are useful  in the initial 
imaging  workup of chronic  hip pain [12]. Oftentimes  a pelvic radiograph,  which  includes  imaging  of both hips,  
may be obtained concurrently with additional  dedicated  collimated  radiograph(s)  of the affected  hip(s). Findings  on 
hip radiographs  can result  in an imaging  diagnosis  such as osteoarthritis  or can lead to more  advanced  workups  of 
less common causes of chronic  hip pain such as primary  bone  tumors.  The results of screening  hip radiographs  can 
help guide  the use of additional  imaging  studies such as more  specialized  radiographic  views  or more  advanced  
modalities  such as CT, ultrasound (US), MRI,  radionuclide  bone  scans,  and fluoride  PET [13-15]. 
Radiography Pelvis  
The literature  indicates that radiography  is a first-line screening  tool, and pelvic  radiographs  are useful  in the initial 
imaging  workup of chronic  hip pain [12]. A pelvic  radiograph  is an excellent  initial examination  because it allows  
for evaluation  of both hip joints  on a single  radiographic  image,  allowing  for comparison  of the ipsilateral  and 
contralateral  hips.  Oftentimes,  a pelvic  radiograph may be obtained concurrently with additional  dedicated  
radiograph(s)  of the affected  hip. Findings  on pelvic  radiographs  can result  in an imaging  diagnosis  such as 
osteoarthritis  or may lead to more  advanced  workups  of less common  causes of chronic  hip pain such as primary  
bone  tumors.

Summary  of Recommendations 
• Variant 1 : Radiography pelvis and Radiography hip are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of chronic 
hip pain. These procedures are complementary (ie, more than one procedure is ordered as a set or simultaneously 
in which each procedure provides unique clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 2 : In the setting of chronic hip pain with negative or nondiagnostic radiographs, MRI hip  without IV 
contrast or US hip  is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for suspected noninfectious extra -articular 
abnormality, such as tendonitis or bursitis.  These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure 
will be ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 3 : In the setting of chronic hip pain with negative or nondiagnostic radiographs, MR arthrography hip 
or MRI hip without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for suspected impingement or 
dysplasia. These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be ordered to provide the 
clinical informatio n to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 4 : In the setting of chronic hip pain with negative or nondiagnostic radiographs, MR arthrography hip 
or MRI hip without IV contrast is usually appropriate to evaluate for a labral  tear. These procedures  are 
equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 5 : In the setting of chronic hip pain with equivocal or mild osteoarthritis by radiographs , MR 
arthr ography hip or MRI hip without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study to assess 
articular cartilage integrity. These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be ordered 
to provide the clinical information to  effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 6 : In the setting of chronic hip pain,  MRI hip without and with IV contrast or MRI hip without IV 
contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study when radiographs are suspicious for intra -articular 
synovial hyperplasia or neoplasia , including nodular synovitis, diffuse tenosynovial giant cell tumor, 
osteochondromatosis, or other synovial neoplasm . These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one 
procedure will be ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 7 : In the setting of concomitant chronic hip pain with low back or knee pathology or pain, Image -
guided anesthetic +/ - corticosteroid injection of the hip joint or surrounding st ructures is usually appropriate as 
the next imaging study to quantify the amount of pain arising from the hip when radiographs also demonstrate 
hip osteoarthritis.

US Hip 
In general,  US is limited  in its use for evaluating  osseous structures.  However,  there is limited  literature  that 
demonstrates that US can be used to evaluate osseous features of FAI such as the alpha -angle  [73]. However,  US is 
not able to adequately  evaluate osseous abnormalities  deep  to the cortex.  One of the advantages  of US is its ability  
to dynamically  evaluate for extra-articular  soft tissue  impingement.  US is not as sensitive as MRI or CT 
arthrography  for the detection  of labral  tears  [17], but it can be useful  for the detection  and localization  of paralabral  
cysts for aspiration  and injection  [39,41] .

Some  authors  have  shown  that CT arthrography  can be useful  in the detection  of acetabular  labral  tears [17,74] , 
which  may be associated  with FAI, but other  authors  have  shown  that CT arthrography is not very good for the 
detection  of labral  tears [18].

Diagnostic joint injections  are safe and useful  tools  for confirming  the etiology  of pain, such as a labral  tear or 
symptomatic  paralabral  cyst [20-22]. 
MR Arthrography  Hip 
Direct  MR arthrography,  with the intraarticular  injection  of a 1:200 solution  of gadolinium  chelate in saline,  has 
been  established  as a reliable  technique  for diagnosing acetabular  labral  tears [75-80]  that are frequently  associated  
with FAI [81,82] . MR arthrography has been  shown  to have  a sensitivity  of 94.5%  and a specificity  of 100%  for 
the detection  of labral  tears [52].

US Hip 
The literature  indicates that US is useful  for the evaluation  of extra -articular  soft tissues in the region of the hip 
[23]. US can also nicely  demo nstrate fluid  collections  around the hip, such as bursitis  and paralabral  cysts.  Tendon  
pathology,  such as tendinosis , tears,  or snapping iliopsoas tendons  can also be identified  with US [38-41]. US may 
also be useful  for the dynamic  evaluation  of the iliopsoas  tendon,  such as in snapping  hip syndrome.

CT Arthrography  Hip 
Pathology  associated  with femoracetabular  impingement  (FAI) may be both intra- and extra-articular . CT is often  
used for preoperative assessment  of bony anatomy  in the setting  of FAI and hip dysplasia [42-44]. CT arthrography  
has been  shown  to be sensitive  for detection  of acetabular  labral  tears [17], which  may be associated  with FAI. CT 
arthrography has also been  shown  to be more  helpful  in identifying  chondral  lesions [16] when  compared  to MRI.  
However,  arthrography does not offer an advantage  over noncontrast  CT for the detection  of extra-articular  
impingement  (eg, ischiopelvic,  ischiotrochanteric,  subspinous,  and femoropelvic).  
CT Hip With  IV Contrast  
CT without  IV contrast  is often  used for preoperative  assessment  of bony anatomy  in the setting  of FAI and hip 
dysplasia [42-44]. However,  IV contrast  administration  does not confer  an additional  advantage  for evaluation  of 
hip impingement.  
CT Hip Without  and With  IV Contrast  
Noncontrast  CT is often  used for preoperative assessment  of bony  anatomy  in the setting  of FAI and hip dysplasia  
[42-44]. IV contrast  administration  is not warranted  for evaluation  of hip impingement.  
CT Hip Without  IV Contrast  
FAI is associated  with both intra- and extra-articular  pathology.  Noncontrast  CT is often  used for preoperative  
assessment  of bony  anatomy  in the setting  of FAI and hip dysplasia [42-44]. CT without  IV contrast  is not; however,  
helpful  in the assessment  of the articular  cartilage or labral  status.  Volume  rendered  3-D reconstructions  generated  
from  noncontrast  CT data are useful  for quantifying the femoral  head -neck  morphology and providing a noninvasive  
assessment  of hips at risk of FAI [62].  Some  centers evaluate the shape and contours  of the femoral  neck  by 
employing radial  imaging  or radial  reconstructions.  Software programs  can use CT data to generate virtual models  
of the hip that can detect  the presence of impingement  throughout  a hip’s  range  of motion.  CT can also be helpful  
in identifying  extra-articular  impingement  (ischiopelvic,  ischiotrochanteric,  subspinous,  and femoropelvic)  [45,46] .

Explanation: 
Based on the patient's symptoms of bilateral knee pain, worse on the right, and the presence of bilateral knee crepitus and small joint effusions, further imaging is warranted to assess for degenerative changes. MRI is a suitable imaging modality for evaluating the knee joint and can provide detailed information about the cartilage, ligaments, and other structures. The addition of IV contrast can help in the assessment of synovitis, ligaments, and bone marrow lesions.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 8 Chronic Knee Pain  CT Knee  
Dual -energy CT without  IV contrast may be indicated if gout  or mixed crystal disease is a consideration.  
Otherwise, CT i s not commonly used as a diagnostic test to evaluate patients with osteoarthritis or 
chondrocalcinosis.  Limited CT without IV contrast can be used for surgical planning.  
CT Arthrography  Knee  
CT arthrography is not commonly utilized as a second test in pati ents with arthritis even though CT is the most 
accurate method for evaluating cartilage abnormalities extending to the articular surface that is  due to the high 
spatial resolution between the contrast and the cartilage [11].  
MRI Knee  
MRI without IV contrast is not usually indicated in patients for whom radiographs are diagnostic of osteoarthritis 
unless symptoms are not explained by the radiographic findings (eg, s tress fractures) or the appropriate treatment 
option requires additional imaging [11, 19]. 
Given the increased sensitivity of MRI for osteoarthritis, MRI may be indicated when more accurate or serial 
cartilage measurements are desired [10 ,55,56]. In patients >70 years of age, a higher correlation with the 
“abnormal” knee being painful is present when structural abnormalities are unilateral on either radiographs or 
MRI. S ince bilateral structural abnormalities can be present with primarily unilateral symptoms, the ability to 
discriminate painful from nonpainful knees is limited [57] . This persists even when using the MRI presence of 
synovitis or effusion and/or a Kellgren and Lawrence score of ≥ 2; findings were reported to be the best 
discriminators between painful and asymptomatic knees [19].  
Patellofemoral cartilage loss is closely associated with chronic knee pain with active knee pain correlated with BMLs [56]. Since MRI is more accurate than physical examination in identifying severe grades of 
chondromalacia patellae, it may be an appropriate screening tool prior to arthroscopy [58 ]. 
MRI with and without IV contrast is indicated when performing semiquantitative assessment of knee 
osteoarthritis using various scoring systems to include cartilage, synovitis, ligaments, BMLs , and menisci [18].  In 
obese patients with osteoarthritis on contrast -enhanced images, increased perfusion in Hoffa’s fat is associated 
with more severe anterior knee pain [59 ].  
MR Arthrography  Knee  
MR arthrography is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with osteoarthritis or chondrocalcinosis.  
US Knee  
US is not often useful as a screening test or a comprehensive examination.  US can detect synovial pathology, 
effusions , and cortical erosive changes [11]. Power Doppler US  can demonstrate increased synovial blood flow 
that is associated with knee pain and can demonstrat e reduced blood flow , which correlates with reduced knee 
pain following joint injections [60]. US can also demonstrate meniscal extrusion , a finding th at suggests an 
underlying meniscal tear , and , on occasion , chondrocalcinosis and peripheral meniscal tears [11].  
Bone Scan Knee  
Radionuclide bone scan  is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with chronic knee pain given the low 
specificity and decreased anatomic resolution compared to CT or MRI [11].  However, i t may help distinguish 
between bone and soft -tissue origins for pain as well as localize pain to one or more joints [11].  
Image -Guided Aspiration Knee  
If an effusion is present, US - or fluoroscopically guided joint aspiration can be performed for synovial fluid 
analysis if there is concern for crystal disease or infection.  Corticosteroid injections can also be performed as they 
may result in a 1  to 2 week reduction in synovitis on MR I in two -thirds of patients. MRI also demonstrates a 
subsequent increase in the synovial volume in approximately 70% of patients that develop recurrent pain [61 ].

Summary of Literature Review  
Background/Introduction 
Chronic knee pain affects tens of millions of people  in the United States annually , with the pain sometimes highly 
disabling and often negatively impacting the patient’s quality of life. Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and 
it can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain 
with the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. 
Typically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain 
persists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  
imaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated 
that approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the 
prior year) radiographs [2 ]. 
This document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  ≥5 years of age.  The 
variants discussed include: (1) initial exam ination ; (2) initial radiograph is normal or demonstrates a joint 
effusion; (3) initial radiogr aph demonstrates osteochondritis dissecans (OCD), loose bodies or history of cartilage,  
or meniscal repair; (4) initial radiograph demonstrates osteoarthritis or chondrocalcinosis; and (5)  initial 
radiograph demonstrates signs of prior (chronic) knee injur y (ie, Segond fract ure, tibial spine avulsion, etc ).  
To evaluat e knee pain associated with other conditions, please refer to the following ACR Appropriateness 
Criteria® topic on:  “Osteonecrosi s of the Hip ” [3] for osteonecrosis,  “Acute Trauma to the Knee ” for acute knee 
injuries  [4], “Imaging After Total Knee Arthroplasty ” for patients with total knee arthroplasty  [5], “Soft-Tissue 
Masses ” for a patient with a suspected soft -tissue mass [6], “Primary Bone Tumors ” for a patient with a suspected 
or known bone tumor [ 7], and “ Chronic Extremity Joint Pain -Suspected Inflammatory Arthritis ” for patient with 
suspected arthritis  or synovitis [ 8]. 
Special Imaging  Considerations  
Knee radiographs  should include at least one frontal projection of one or both knees (anteroposterior, Rosenberg, 
or tunnel), a tangential patellar view , and a lateral view of the affected knee [2,9]. Standing radiographs more 
accurately reflect medial and lateral compartment cartilage loss than supine radiographs with the posteromedial and posterolateral joint compartments  more accurately assessed using a weight -bearing flexion posteroanterior 
radiograph [9,10]. 
Discussion of Pro cedures by Variant  
Variant 1:  Adult or child greater than or equal to 5  year s of age . Chronic knee pain. Initial imaging.  
Radiography Knee 
Radiographs  should be the initial imaging study for chronic knee pain. In elderly patients, the most common 
source of  chronic knee pain is osteoarthritis.

Guideline: ACR chronic knee pain.pdf, Page: 6
Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 6 Chronic Knee Pain  of age having an asymptomatic meniscal tear , and the likelihood of a meniscal tear being present in either a 
painful or asymptomatic knee not significantly different in patients 45 to 55 years of age [20,21]. 
Bone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the 
subchondral bone.  New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or 
patients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee 
pain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the 
origin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. 
Subchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed 
spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to 
elderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs 
often initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, 
and progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is 
suspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria
® 
topic on “ Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae ” [28]. 
Some patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using 
quantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs 
exhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ]. 
Patellofemoral car tilage loss is also associated with chronic knee pain , with active knee pain correlated with 
BMLs [30,31]. Similar to CT, MRI can calculate various anatomic measurements associated with patellofemoral 
subluxation/dislocation and lateral patellofemoral friction syndrome [32-34]. Bone marrow edema in the classic 
location for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also 
differentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise 
therapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. 
Other etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat 
pad impingement syndromes, Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome, adhesive 
capsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes , 
and osteonecrosis [15, 19,36-45].  
MRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a 
joint effusion. However, contrast -enhanced images ma y be more accurate in diagnosing other causes of chronic 
knee pain , such as Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome, and adhesive 
capsulitis [15].  In particular, enh ancing synovitis thicker than 2 mm in Hoffa’s fat is correlated with peripatellar 
pain [46]. Contrast -enhanced MRI is also useful in quantifying the degree of synovitis and in evaluating 
conditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis [ 17,42,47,48].  
MR Arthrography  Knee  
MR arthrography performed with an intra -articular injection of dilute gadolinium solution is typically not 
indicated as a second exam ination  but rather reserved for patients with known prior meniscal surgery, chondral

Radiography Hip 
An ipsilateral hip radiograph is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with osteochondritis dissecans ( OCD) , 
loose bodies , or history of cartilage repair.  
CT Knee  
CT without IV contrast may be  indicated  to evaluate patients with OCD or a history of cartilage repair , especially 
to confirm loose bodies or when MRI is not definitive.  
CT with IV contrast is not usually indicated to evaluate patients with OCD, loose bodies,  or history of cartilage 
repair.  
CT without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated to evaluate pati ents with OCD, loose bodies,  or history of 
cartilage repair.  
CT Arthrography  Knee  
CT arthrography may be used instead of MRI to evaluate the menisci, articular cartilage, and the presence of loose 
bodies [16].  
MRI Knee  
In patients with OC D or subchondral insufficiency fracture on radiographs, MRI without IV contrast may be 
indicated if an additional injury is suspected clinically or to clarify the status of the overlying articular cartilage 
[41]. A hyperintense rim or cysts at the osteochondral fragment periphery on MRI are less specific for OCD fragment instability in children compared to adults; however, MRI is still useful to determine the best method of 
treatment [41,50]. Following cartilage repair, MRI can grade the repair site and even guide the retrograde drilling 
of the OCD l esion [51-54] . 
MRI with and without IV contrast is not usually indicated  to evaluate patients with OCD, loose bodies,  or history 
of cartilage repair because of the  usual larger volume of joint fluid, the lesser degree of synovial invagination,  and 
the longer time required to achieve steady state gadolinium in the joint compared to the shoulder [16].  
MR Arthrography  Knee  
MR arthrography is typically  reserved for patients with known prior meniscal surgery, chondral and 
osteochondral lesions, prior cartilage repair procedures, or suspected loose bodies [10, 16]. 
US Knee  
US is not often useful as a screening test or a comprehensive examination.  It may be appropriate to localize 
suspected loose bodies, especially if the loose bodies might be within a popliteal cyst , lateral recess, or 
suprapatellar recess.  
Bone Scan Knee  
Radionuclide bone scan is usually not indicated to evaluate patients with OCD, loose bodies,  or history of 
cartilage repair.

Bone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the 
subchondral bone.  New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or 
patients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee 
pain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the 
origin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. 
Subchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed 
spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to 
elderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs 
often initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, 
and progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is 
suspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria
® 
topic on “ Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae ” [28]. 
Some patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using 
quantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs 
exhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ]. 
Patellofemoral car tilage loss is also associated with chronic knee pain , with active knee pain correlated with 
BMLs [30,31]. Similar to CT, MRI can calculate various anatomic measurements associated with patellofemoral 
subluxation/dislocation and lateral patellofemoral friction syndrome [32-34]. Bone marrow edema in the classic 
location for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also 
differentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise 
therapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. 
Other etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat 
pad impingement syndromes, Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome, adhesive 
capsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes , 
and osteonecrosis [15, 19,36-45].  
MRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a 
joint effusion. However, contrast -enhanced images ma y be more accurate in diagnosing other causes of chronic 
knee pain , such as Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome, and adhesive 
capsulitis [15].  In particular, enh ancing synovitis thicker than 2 mm in Hoffa’s fat is correlated with peripatellar 
pain [46]. Contrast -enhanced MRI is also useful in quantifying the degree of synovitis and in evaluating 
conditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis [ 17,42,47,48].  
MR Arthrography  Knee  
MR arthrography performed with an intra -articular injection of dilute gadolinium solution is typically not 
indicated as a second exam ination  but rather reserved for patients with known prior meniscal surgery, chondral 
and osteochondral lesions , and suspected loose bodies  [10].

Summary of Literature Review  
Background/Introduction 
Chronic knee pain affects tens of millions of people  in the United States annually , with the pain sometimes highly 
disabling and often negatively impacting the patient’s quality of life. Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and 
it can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain 
with the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. 
Typically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain 
persists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  
imaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated 
that approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the 
prior year) radiographs [2 ]. 
This document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  ≥5 years of age.  The 
variants discussed include: (1) initial exam ination ; (2) initial radiograph is normal or demonstrates a joint 
effusion; (3) initial radiogr aph demonstrates osteochondritis dissecans (OCD), loose bodies or history of cartilage,  
or meniscal repair; (4) initial radiograph demonstrates osteoarthritis or chondrocalcinosis; and (5)  initial 
radiograph demonstrates signs of prior (chronic) knee injur y (ie, Segond fract ure, tibial spine avulsion, etc ).  
To evaluat e knee pain associated with other conditions, please refer to the following ACR Appropriateness 
Criteria® topic on:  “Osteonecrosi s of the Hip ” [3] for osteonecrosis,  “Acute Trauma to the Knee ” for acute knee 
injuries  [4], “Imaging After Total Knee Arthroplasty ” for patients with total knee arthroplasty  [5], “Soft-Tissue 
Masses ” for a patient with a suspected soft -tissue mass [6], “Primary Bone Tumors ” for a patient with a suspected 
or known bone tumor [ 7], and “ Chronic Extremity Joint Pain -Suspected Inflammatory Arthritis ” for patient with 
suspected arthritis  or synovitis [ 8]. 
Special Imaging  Considerations  
Knee radiographs  should include at least one frontal projection of one or both knees (anteroposterior, Rosenberg, 
or tunnel), a tangential patellar view , and a lateral view of the affected knee [2,9]. Standing radiographs more 
accurately reflect medial and lateral compartment cartilage loss than supine radiographs with the posteromedial and posterolateral joint compartments  more accurately assessed using a weight -bearing flexion posteroanterior 
radiograph [9,10].

ligamentous  injuries  [14,15,50,51]  and predict  menisc al [15,50,51]  injuries. However,  MRI is superior  to CT in

CT Knee  
CT may be performed  as the next imaging  study  for the evaluation  of suspected  radiographically occult  knee  
fractures.  
Several  studies reported  CT to be superior  to knee  radiographs  in detection  and classification  of fractures.  In a study 
by Mustonen  et al [12],  CT showed  100%  and radiographs  83% sensitivity  in detection  of tibial plateau fractures , 
and CT was superior  in further  characterization  of fracture  severity . 
In the setting  of acute knee  trauma,  Mui et al [13] reported  80% sensitivity  and 98% specificity  of the CT 
examination  in detecting  bony  avulsion  fractures and a high negative  predictive  value  for excluding  ligamentous  
injuries , but MRI remained  necessary  for the preoperative  detection  of meniscal  injury . 
Peltola  et al [14] compared  dual-energy  CT examinations  with MRI  studies as a reference standard  in 18 patients  
with acute knee  trauma  and reported  dual-energy  CT had 79% sensitivity  and 100%  specificity  in detecting  anterior  
cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures  [14]. 
In a study  by Heffernan  et al [15], 64-channel  multidetector  CT showed  87.5% to 100%  sensitivity  and 100%  
specificity  for detection  of the ACL  tears.  As on MRI,  secondary  signs,  such as buckling  of the posterior  cruciate 
ligament , were also useful  in their diagnosis.  In this study , multidetector  CT showed a low sensitivity  for other  soft-
tissue injuries  at the knee;  however,  its high specificity  indicated  that apparent  posterior  cruciate  ligament , meniscal,  
and collateral  ligament  tears can reliably  be treated  as true-positive  findings  [15]. 
The dual-energy  CT virtual  noncalcium  technique  can subtract  calcium  from  cancellous bone,  allowing  detection  
[16-18] and possibly grading of the post-traumatic  bone  marrow  contusions  [18]. 
However,  MRI is superior  to CT in detection  of bone  marrow  abnormalities  and meniscal  and ligamentous  injuries  
and may be subsequently  performed  as clinically  indicated.

tissue injuries  rather  than osseous injuries  [19].  MRI  is a proven valuable  tool in the treatment  decision -making

US is reported  to be 98% sensitive and 94% specific for calcium  hydroxyapatite  in the rotator  cuff tendons  [71], 
although  identification  may be challenging if the area of calcium  deposition  is small . At times  US may have  
difficulty  distinguishing calcific  deposits  from  heterotopic  ossification  because both can result  in dense shadowing  
at US. US can be used if there  is concern  for concomitant  rotator  cuff tendon tear and may be a better  modality  than 
MRI in this situation  given the difficulty  of distinguishing  calcium  from  normal  tendon at MRI.  
Variant  4: Chronic  shoulder  pain. Suspect  labral pathology  or shoulder  instability.  Initial radiographs  
normal  or inconclusive. Next  imaging  study.  
Bone  Scan  Shoulder  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of bone  scan shoulder  in the evaluation  of chronic  shoulder  pain 
when  labral  pathology  or shoulder  instability  is suspected.  
CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
CT arthrograms  have  been  shown  to be an accurate modality  in the assessment  of shoulder  instability  because of  its 
depiction  of osseous,  cartilaginous,  and labroligamentous  injuries  [18,72] . Labral  evaluation  in the postoperative  
setting  may be better  with CT arthrography than MRI  in patients  with metallic  suture  anchors  [73] and has been  
used to evaluate for healing  after superior  labrum  anterior -to-posterior  (SLAP)  repair  [74]. Dual -energy  CT 
arthrography  has a similar  diagnostic  performance  as MR arthrography  [75]. Although CT arthrography aids in the 
evaluation  of underlying soft tissues,  the injected  contrast  may limit evaluation  of the underlying osseous structures,  
and cortical  fragments in the injected  contrast  solution  often  have a similar  attenuation  to cortical  bone  [76]. Other  
limitations  include  the need  for an invasive  arthrography procedure  and poor assessment  of bone  marrow  edema  
[72]. 
CT Shoulder  With  IV Contrast  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of CT shoulder  with IV contrast  in the evaluation  of chronic  
shoulder  pain when  labral  pathology or shoulder  instability  is suspected.

There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of CT shoulder  without  and with IV contrast  in the evaluation  of 
chronic  shoulder  pain when  labral  pathology or shoulder  instability  is suspected.  
CT Shoulder  Without  IV Contrast  
CT is helpful  for assessing  bony  glenoid deficiency  as well as the size of a Hill-Sachs deformity  when  surgery  is a 
consideration  but is not effective at evaluating  the labrum.  CT is often  preferable  to MRI when  evaluating  for small  
fracture  fragments of the glenoid rim and assessing  bone  stock  in patients  with recurrent  dislocation  [77-79]. Three-
dimensional  reconstructions  can be used to quantify  osseous defect  width  and glenoid  surface area [80,81] . CT can 
also be used to measure the size of a Hill-Sachs defect  [82,83] , which  has become more  important  with the 
development  of the glenoid track  concept  for determining  instability  [84,85] . In the postoperative  setting, CT can 
be used to evaluate integration  of bone  graft  from  a coracoid  transfer  with the underlying glenoid [86,87] .

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 15 Chronic Shoulder Pain  Radiography Shoulder  Additional Views  
Glenohumeral  osteoarthritis  is typically  well visualized  on conventional  radiographic  views,  without  the need  for 
special  views.  A standard  axillary  view can demonstrate posterior  subluxation of the humeral  head  and abnormal  
glenoid morphology in patients with severe osteoarthritis  [145-147] . A measurement  of the critical shoulder  angle  
can be drawn  on routine  AP radiographs  by measuring  the angle  between  a line along the glenoid  surface and a line 
from  the inferior glenoid to the lateral  acromial  margin;  patients  with a higher  measurement  may be at high risk of 
having a full thickness rotator  cuff tear [148] . 
US Shoulder  
Although secondary  signs  of osteoarthritis  such as osteophytes,  joint effusion , and intra-articular  bodies  can be seen 
with US [142] , it is not typically  performed  for this indication.

with a history  of prior  rotator  cuff repair  when  rotator  cuff disorder  or subacromial  subdeltoid bursitis  is suspected.  
CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
As in the native  shoulder,  CT arthrography can be used to evaluate for rotator  cuff tear after surgery . In patients  
with metal  in the shoulder , CT arthrography can be beneficial  in detecting  supraspinatus  tears that may be obscured  
by metal  artifact  [73]. Gadolinium  contrast  can potentially  be drawn  up into a mixture  with iodinated  contrast  at the 
time of the arthrogram  procedure,  thus allowing  for a shift from  MRI  to CT if artifact  on MRI preclude s evaluation.

shoulder  pain with a history  of prior  rotator  cuff repair  when  rotator  cuff disorder  or subacromial  subdeltoid bursitis  
is suspected.

There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of MRI shoulder  without  IV contrast  in the initial evaluation  of 
chronic  shoulder  pain.  
Radiography Shoulder  
Most  literature  suggests that radiographs  should be the initial imaging  study  in patients  with shoulder  pain [1,10] . 
Standard  radiographic  exam ination  consists of a combination  of different  projections  typically  including  
anteroposterior  (AP) internal  rotation,  AP external  rotation,  Grashey  (oblique  AP in the plane  of the glenohumeral  
joint), scapular  “Y,” and axillary  views [10]. Radiographs  can evaluate for unexpected  fracture,  unsuspected  
aggressive bony lesion,  osteoarthritis, inflammatory  arthropathy,  osteonecrosis,  or calcium  hydroxyapatite  
deposition.  Accurate  interpretation  of radiographs  can often  obviate  additional  imaging  or be complementary  to 
subsequent  imaging studie s. A high-riding  humeral  head  on radiographs  is highly associated  with chronic  rotator  
cuff tear [11], particularly  if seen in combination with sclerosis of the inferior acromion,  greater  tuberosity  cysts,  a 
lateral  acromial  spur, and cortical  irregularity  or sclerosis of the greater  tuberosity  [12-14]. 
US Shoulder  
The literature  suggests that radiographic  evaluation  should  generally  be the first imaging  study  ordered  in patients  
with shoulder  pain [1,10-14] . Some practitioners  may use ultrasound (US) as an initial imaging  study when  rotator  
cuff disease/impingement  is suggested  by the clinical  exam ination .

Bone  Scan  Shoulder  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of bone  scan shoulder  in the evaluation  of chronic  shoulder  pain 
when  rotator  cuff disorder  or subacromial  subdeltoid bursitis  is suspected . 
CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
CT arthrography  has shown  good diagnostic  performance for depicting  rotator  cuff tendon  tears with a reported  
respective sensitivity  and specificity  of 99% and 100%  for the supraspinatus  tendon,  97.4%  and 99.5%  for the 
infraspinatus  tendon,  and 64.7%  and 98.2%  for the subscapularis tendon  [15]. CT arthrography provides  a 
comparable alternative  to MR arthrography in the evaluation  of rotator  cuff tendon tears [16,17] . CT arthrography 
is able to detect  very subtle  articular  surface cuff defects,  but, because of lack of contrast  extension  from  the 
glenohumeral  joint space,  it is less effective at demonstrating bursal  surface or intrasubstance tears,  which  are 
typically  well seen with MRI or US [18]. 
CT Shoulder  With  IV Contrast  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of CT shoulder  with IV contrast  in the evaluation  of chronic  
shoulder  pain when  rotator  cuff disorder  or subacromial  subdeltoid bursitis  is suspected.  
CT Shoulder  Without  and With  IV Contrast  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of CT shoulder  without  and with IV contrast  in the evaluation  of 
chronic  shoulder  pain when  rotator  cuff disorder  or subacromial  subdeltoid  bursitis  is suspected.  
CT Shoulder  Without  IV Contrast  
CT shoulder  without  IV contrast  is of limited  utility  when  evaluating  for rotator  cuff tear or subacromial  subdeltoid  
bursitis. Noncontrast  CT can sometimes  demonstrate fatty infiltration  of rotator  cuff muscles with a corresponding 
rotator  cuff tear, although  the overall  sensitivity  of this finding  is low [19]. CT may demonstrate a high-riding  
humeral  head  or remodeling  of the acromial  undersurface in patients  with large  rotator  cuff tears.  However,  this 
finding  is generally  seen on initial radiographs , and CT does not allow  for characterization  of the underlying tear 
because CT lacks the soft-tissue contrast  resolution  necessary  to adequately  evaluate the rotator  cuff tear itself.  CT 
may be able to directly  demonstrate  some  large rotator  cuff tears  as well as fatty infiltration  of the rotator  cuff 
musculature;  however , it was found to have  a sensitivity  of 20% for full thickness  rotator  cuff tears in one small  
study [19]. Large  amounts  of fluid  in the subacromial  subdeltoid  bursa  can sometimes be visualized  with CT.

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  shoulder  pain lasting  >6 months  is a common  presenting  complaint , particularly  in patients  ≥40 years of 
age [1]. Along with a thorough history and physical  examination,  imaging  plays  a critical  role in determining the 
source of chronic  shoul der pain.  Common pain generators in the shoulder  include  the rotator  cuff tendons,  biceps 
tendon,  labrum,  glenohumeral  articular  cartilage,  acromioclavicular  joint, bones,  suprascapular  and axillary  nerves,  
and the joint capsule/synovium.  Imaging  can help to guide  appropriate  therapy , which  can range  from  conservative  
measures such as physical  therapy  and cortico steroid  injections  to more  invasive  procedures  such as arthroscopy or 
surgery . This document  focuses on the imaging approach  to patients  with suspected  chronic  mechanical  shoulder  
pain. See the separate ACR Appropriateness Criteria® topics  on “Chronic  Extremity  Joint  Pain-Suspected  
Inflammatory  Arthritis ” [2], “Imaging After  Shoulder  Arthroplasty ” [3], “Primary  Bone  Tumors ” [4], “Soft-Tissue 
Masses ” [5], and “Shoulder  Pain-Traumatic ” [6] if further guidance  is needed  for potential alternative  causes of 
shoulder  pain.  
Special Imaging  Considerations   
Several  studies have  looked for ways to shorten  typical  shoulder  conventional  MRI or MR arthrogram  protocols  
while  maintaining  diagnostic  accuracy.  Isotropic  3-D imaging has been  increasingly  used as a substitute  for 
conventional  multiplanar  2-D MRI,  with a similar  sensitivity  and specificity  for rotator  cuff tear and labral  
abnormalities  at a lower  scan time [7,8] . Faster  scans can also be performed  using 2-D fast spin echo  sequences  
with parallel  imaging , which  produce  similar  findings  as seen on conventional  MRI [9]. 
Initial Imaging  Definition 
Initial imaging  is defined  as imaging  at the beginning of the care episode for the medical  condition defined  by the 
variant.  More  than one procedure  can be considered  usually  appropriate  in the initial imaging  evaluation  when : 
• There are procedures  that are equivalent  alternatives (ie, only one procedure  will be ordered  to 
provide  the clinical  information  to effectively  manage the patient’s  care)  
OR 
• There are complementary  procedures  (ie, more  than one procedure  is ordered  as a set or 
simultaneously  where each procedure  provides  unique  clinical  information  to effectively  manage  
the patient’s  care).

subsequent  arthroscopy  in a study  consisting  mostly  of patients  who underwent  CT arthrography.  CT arthrography

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 12 Chronic Shoulder Pain  Image -Guided Anesthetic +/- Corticosteroid  Injection  Shoulder  or Surrounding  Structures  
Image -guided injection  of the glenohumeral  joint for adhesive capsulitis  can be performed  with either  fluoroscopy 
or US guidance . Image -guided cortico steroid  injection  has been  shown  to have  a significant  reduction in pain and 
an improvement  in the range  of motion  for patients  with adhesive capsulitis  [105,106] . Use of US guidance  for 
glenohumeral  cortico steroid  injection  may be more  accurate and produce  a greater  improvement  in pain and 
functional  scores relative  to blind  injection  [107] . Patients  with adhesive capsulitis  have  been  found to be the only 
group with a statistically  better  outcome  after glenohumeral  joint injection  than other  patients;  thus a positive  
response to a glenohumeral  injection  can be suggestive  of the presence of adhesive capsulitis  in the appropriate  
clinical  context  [23]. Fluoroscopic  injection  can also demonstrate diagnostic  findings  suggestive of adhesive  
capsulitis  including  joint space capacity  <10 mL, diminished axillary  recess,  and irregularity  of the capsular  margin  
[108] . 
MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
Mengiardi  et al [109]  reported  that thickening  of the coracohumeral  ligament  (specificity  95%,  sensitivity  59%),  
thickening  of the joint capsule (specificity  86%,  sensitivity  64%) , and obliteration  of the subcoracoid  triangle  
(specificity  100%,  sensitivity  32%)  are characteristic  MR arthrograph y findings  in adhesive capsulitis . However,  
fluid  within  the rotator  interval  or along  the axillary  recess due to the arthrogram  injection  itself  can serve as a 
limitation  to detecting  findings  of adhesive capsulitis  on MRI arthrography.  
MRI Shoulder  Without  and With  IV Contrast  
Contrast -enhanced  MRI can increase the conspicuity of axillary  recess capsular  thickening [110]  and rotator  interval  
soft-tissue thickening [111] , although there  are conflicting  data on the relationship  of this capsular  enhancement  
with patient  symptoms  [112] . 
MRI Shoulder  Without  IV Contrast  
Zhao  et al [113]  showed  that coracohumeral  ligament thickening,  anterior  capsule thickening,  and obliteration  of 
the subcoracoid  fat are the most  characteristic findings  of adhesive capsulitis  on conventional  MRI.  Chi et al [114]  
found a sensitivity  of 77% and a specificity  of 53% for adhesive capsulitis  with only coracohumeral  ligament  
thickening  on noncontrast  MRI,  with a lower  sensitivity  (23%)  but a higher  specificity  (87%)  in patients  who had 
all 3 findings  of adhesive capsulitis , including  coracohumeral  ligament  thickening,  rotator  interval  infiltration, and 
axillary  recess thickening.

There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of additional  radiographic  views in the evaluation  of chronic  
shoulder  pain when  adhesive capsulitis  is suspected.  
US Shoulder  
US in the setting  of potential adhesive capsulitis  is often  used to exclude rotator  cuff tear. Although there are several  
US findings  that can be seen in patients  with adhesive capsulitis,  US is not typically  performed  specifically  for this 
indication. Thickening of the coracohumeral  ligament, increased  rotator  interval  soft tissue,  and decrease d external  
rotation  on dynamic  US are all highly sensitive and specific findings  for adhesive capsulitis  [115].

tears after prior  labral  repair  is challenging,  MR arthrography is particularly  helpful  in this scenario  in which discrete  
fluid  or gadolinium  signal  within  or underlying  the labrum,  absent  labrum,  and paralabral  cyst are all highly  
suggestive  of recurrent  tear [94], with a greater  sensitivity  than seen with conventional  MRI [73]. 
MRI Shoulder  Without  and With  IV Contrast  
IV injection  of gadolinium  can be used to enhance the highly vascular  synovium  producing an indirect  arthrogram  
effect  [34]. Indirect  arthrography has been  found to have  a sensitivity  of 74% and a specificity  of 67% for SLAP 
tear, which is lower  than for direct  MR arthrography [89]. Although the accuracy  of indirect  MR arthrography has 
been  described  in the literature,  it is not commonly used in clinical  practice.  
MRI Shoulder  Without  IV Contrast  
Conventional  MRI with 3T imaging  is highly  accurate for the detection  of a labral  tear, with a sensitivity  of 83% 
and a specificity  of 99% to 100%  for a labral  tear [90]. MR arthrogra phy adds additional  benefit  to conventional  
shoulder  MRI  because it may identify  some  labral  tears that are not seen with conventional  MRI  [95]. The increased  
accuracy  with MR arthrog raphy should be balanced  against  the need  for an invasive  arthrogram  procedure.  
Although evaluation  of glenoid bony integrity  is typically  better  with CT imaging,  some  practitioners have  used 
ultrashort  or zero echo  time sequences [96-98], 3-D sequences  [99], or conventional  MRI  sequences  [100]  to 
measure glenoid bone  loss with a high concordance  to CT images.  
Radiography Shoulder  Additional Views  
There are several  options  for additional  radiographic  views in patients  with suspected  instability  [1]. The West  Point  
and Garth  views can demonstrate the anterior  inferior glenoid at a better  advantage  in patients  with a suspected  
Bankart  fracture.  A Stryker  notch  view can sometimes demonstrate  a Hill-Sachs lesion  that is difficult  to see on 
conventional  projections.  Although these additional  projections  are used by some  practitioners , they do not usually  
alleviate  the need  for advanced  imaging.  
US Shoulder  
The posterior  labrum  can be reliably  visualized  with US, with posterior  labral  tears potentially  visualized  
particularly  if the joint is distended  [101] . However,  US is of limited  benefit  in assessing  the anterior  
labroligamentous  complex,  superior  labrum,  articular  surface,  and subchondral  bone.

Explanation: According to the ACR Appropriateness Criteria, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of MRI shoulder without and with IV contrast in the evaluation of chronic shoulder pain with a history of prior rotator cuff repair when a rotator cuff disorder or subacromial subdeltoid bursitis is suspected. MRI is useful in the evaluation of the postoperative rotator cuff, but for patients with metallic suture anchors, there are commercially available metal artifact reduction sequences that can limit artifact. Additionally, ultrasound (US) provides an excellent method to assess repair integrity in patients who have undergone rotator cuff repair.

There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of MRI  shoulder  without  and with IV contrast  in the evaluation  of 
chronic  shoulder  pain with a history  of prior  rotator  cuff repair  when  a rotator  cuff disorder  or subacromial

MRI Shoulder  Without  IV Contrast  
MRI is useful  in the evaluation  of the postoperative  rotator  cuff. The shift from  metallic  to bioabsorbable  suture  
anchors  tends  to result  in fewer  cases  with metal  artifact  implications  [153] . For patients  with meta llic suture  
anchors,  there are a variety  of commercially  available metal  artifact  reduction sequences,  which  can limit artifact.  
MRI can demonstrate  complications  with suture  anchors  such as osteolys is or migration  [154] , even  if the suture  
anchors  are nonmetallic . MRI can also demonstrate potential improvements  in muscle  atrophy and fatty infiltration  
after rotator  cuff repair  [155,156] .  
Radiography Shoulder  Additional Views  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of additional  radiographic  views in the evaluation  of chronic  
shoulder  pain with a history  of prior  rotator  cuff repair  when  rotator  cuff disorder  or subacromial  subdeltoid bursitis  
is suspected.  
US Shoulder  
An advantage  of US evaluation  of the postoperative  shoulder  is the absence  of metal -induced artifact  when  
examining the rotator  cuff and adjacent  soft tissues.  Patients  who have  undergone  rotator  cuff repair  may show  
discrete defects on US imaging  that may persist  for years with some  potential for delayed  healing  [157] . Despite  
these limitations, US still provides  an excellent  method  to assess repair  integrity, with a high sensitivity  (80.8%)  
and specificity  (100%)  for recurrent  rotator  cuff tear [158] . The ability  to perform  provocative  maneuvers can 
further demonstrate abnormalities  that other  forms  of imaging  would be incapable  identifying.  
Summary  of Recommendations 
• Variant 1 : Radiography is usually appropriate for the initial imaging of chronic shoulder pain.  
• Variant 2 : US or MR arthrography or MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study 
in the evaluation of chronic shoulder pain when  radiographs are normal or inconclusive and rotator cuff 
disorders or subacromial subdeltoid bursitis (no prior surgery)  is suspected . These procedures are equivalent 
alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage 
the patient’s care).  
• Variant 3 : Image -guided anesthetic +/ - corticosteroid injection  is usually appropriate as the next imaging study 
in the evaluation of chronic shoulder pain when radiographs demonstrate calcific tendinopathy or calcific bursitis. 
• Variant 4 : MR arthrography or MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study in the 
evaluation of chronic shoulder pain when radiographs are normal or inconclusive and labral pathology or shoulder instability is suspected.  These procedures a re equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be 
ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 5 : Image -guided anesthetic +/ - corticosteroid injection or MRI without IV contrast is usually 
appropri ate as the next imaging study in the evaluation of chronic shoulder pain when radiographs are normal 
or inconclusive and adhesive capsulitis is suspected.  These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one 
procedure will be ordered to provide the c linical information to effectively manage the patient’s care). Although 
the panel did not agree on recommending US because there is insufficient medical literature to conclude whether these patients would benefit from the procedure, its use may be appropri ate.

IV injection  of gadolinium  can be used to enhance the highly vascular  synovium  producing an indirect  arthrogram  
effect  [34]. Indirect  MR arthrography has been  shown  to have  a slightly  higher  specificity  for diagnosing articular -
surface partial thickness tears  of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus  tendons,  as well as a greater  specificity  for 
diagnosing subscapularis tendon tears [35], relative  to noncontrast  MRI,  and has shown  high accuracy  relative  to 
arthroscopy [36]. Although the accuracy  of indirect  MR arthrography has been  descr ibed in the literature, it is not 
commonly used in clinical  practice.  
MRI Shoulder  Without  IV Contrast  
MRI of the shoulder  is a highly  accurate tool in the assessment  of the rotator  cuff. MRI findings  of tendinopathy  
consist  of intermediate increased  signal  and tendon thickening [28]. Rotator  cuff tears,  particularly  full thickness  
tears,  can be reliably  identified  using conventional  MRI  with high sensitivity  and specificity  [37-39]. Sensitivity  
and specificity  for detecting  partial  thickness bursal  surface  tears is similar  for conventional  MRI and MR 
arthrography  [27]. Although MR arthrography may have  a slightly  higher  sensitivity  and specificity  than 
conventional  MRI for diagnosing  rotator  cuff tears,  particularly  partial  thickness articular  surface tears,  this 
difference in accuracy  must  be weighed  against  the need  for an invasive  arthrogram  procedure  [29]. Tendon 
retraction,  muscle atrophy,  and fatty infiltration  are associated  important  findings  that are well seen on MRI  and 
predict  reparability  of rotator  cuff tear [40]. Axial  images  can be helpful  in determining  rotator  cuff tear shape  [41], 
which  can aid in the selection  of a particular  surgical  technique.  In addition  to evaluating  the rotator  cuff itself , MRI  
can detect  extra-articular  abnormalities  that may predispose  to shoulder  impingemen t such as acromioclavicular  
degenerative change  or a subacromial  spur. Fluid  accumul ation  within  the subacromial  subdeltoid  bursa  is 
visualized  on MRI and is often  a nonspecific finding  seen with a rotator  cuff tear or an underlying  inflammatory  
disorder  [42]. 
Radiography Shoulder  Additional Views  
The rotator  cuff tendons  cannot  be directly  assessed  radiographically,  regardless of the view.  Secondary  findings  of 
rotator  cuff tear such as a high-riding  humeral  head  or changes at the greater  tuberosity  can be seen on standard  
radiographic  views.  There have  been  several  reports  assessing  special  views for the evaluation  of potential  
impingement  from  the anterior  acromion.  Outlet  views  can be used to determine acromial  shape  and have  been  
shown  to be more  accurate than a single -slice MRI [43]. The Rockwood  and cassette tilt views  are angled  frontal  
projection s that can be used to detect  anterior  acromial  osteophyte s [44]. The subacromial  subdeltoid bursa  is a soft-
tissue potential space and is not directly  visualized  on radiographs.  There is a peribursal  fat plane  between  the 
rotator  cuff tendons  and the deltoid  muscle;  however , obliteration  of the peribursal  fat stripe  is not a specific  
indicator  of shoulder  pathology and may be seen in normal  subjects [42].

Glenohumeral  osteoarthritis  is typically  well visualized  on conventional  radiographic  views,  without  the need  for 
special  views.  A standard  axillary  view can demonstrate posterior  subluxation of the humeral  head  and abnormal  
glenoid morphology in patients with severe osteoarthritis  [145-147] . A measurement  of the critical shoulder  angle  
can be drawn  on routine  AP radiographs  by measuring  the angle  between  a line along the glenoid  surface and a line 
from  the inferior glenoid to the lateral  acromial  margin;  patients  with a higher  measurement  may be at high risk of 
having a full thickness rotator  cuff tear [148] . 
US Shoulder  
Although secondary  signs  of osteoarthritis  such as osteophytes,  joint effusion , and intra-articular  bodies  can be seen 
with US [142] , it is not typically  performed  for this indication.

CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
As in the native  shoulder,  CT arthrography can be used to evaluate for rotator  cuff tear after surgery . In patients  
with metal  in the shoulder , CT arthrography can be beneficial  in detecting  supraspinatus  tears that may be obscured  
by metal  artifact  [73]. Gadolinium  contrast  can potentially  be drawn  up into a mixture  with iodinated  contrast  at the 
time of the arthrogram  procedure,  thus allowing  for a shift from  MRI  to CT if artifact  on MRI preclude s evaluation.

CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
CT arthrography  has shown  good diagnostic  performance for depicting  rotator  cuff tendon  tears with a reported  
respective sensitivity  and specificity  of 99% and 100%  for the supraspinatus  tendon,  97.4%  and 99.5%  for the 
infraspinatus  tendon,  and 64.7%  and 98.2%  for the subscapularis tendon  [15]. CT arthrography provides  a 
comparable alternative  to MR arthrography in the evaluation  of rotator  cuff tendon tears [16,17] . CT arthrography 
is able to detect  very subtle  articular  surface cuff defects,  but, because of lack of contrast  extension  from  the 
glenohumeral  joint space,  it is less effective at demonstrating bursal  surface or intrasubstance tears,  which  are 
typically  well seen with MRI or US [18]. 
CT Shoulder  With  IV Contrast  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of CT shoulder  with IV contrast  in the evaluation  of chronic  
shoulder  pain when  rotator  cuff disorder  or subacromial  subdeltoid bursitis  is suspected.  
CT Shoulder  Without  and With  IV Contrast  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of CT shoulder  without  and with IV contrast  in the evaluation  of 
chronic  shoulder  pain when  rotator  cuff disorder  or subacromial  subdeltoid  bursitis  is suspected.  
CT Shoulder  Without  IV Contrast  
CT shoulder  without  IV contrast  is of limited  utility  when  evaluating  for rotator  cuff tear or subacromial  subdeltoid  
bursitis. Noncontrast  CT can sometimes  demonstrate fatty infiltration  of rotator  cuff muscles with a corresponding 
rotator  cuff tear, although  the overall  sensitivity  of this finding  is low [19]. CT may demonstrate a high-riding  
humeral  head  or remodeling  of the acromial  undersurface in patients  with large  rotator  cuff tears.  However,  this 
finding  is generally  seen on initial radiographs , and CT does not allow  for characterization  of the underlying tear 
because CT lacks the soft-tissue contrast  resolution  necessary  to adequately  evaluate the rotator  cuff tear itself.  CT 
may be able to directly  demonstrate  some  large rotator  cuff tears  as well as fatty infiltration  of the rotator  cuff 
musculature;  however , it was found to have  a sensitivity  of 20% for full thickness  rotator  cuff tears in one small  
study [19]. Large  amounts  of fluid  in the subacromial  subdeltoid  bursa  can sometimes be visualized  with CT. 
FDG -PET/CT  Skull Base to Mid-Thigh

in evaluation  for recurrent  cuff tear, but it may be of use for diagnosis  in patients with suspected  subacromial

and improved  signal -to-noise  ratio [150] . Of note,  contrast within  the subacromial  subdeltoid bursa  on routine  and 
MR arthrogram  examinations is a nonspecific finding  that can potentially  be seen in a nonwatertight  rotator  cuff 
repair  [151] . T2 hyperintensity of the repaired  rotator  cuff tendon is a common postoperative  finding,  particularly  
in the first 2 years after surgery,  and does not reflect  adequacy  of tendon healing  or clinical  outcome  [152] .",True

The presence  of glenohumeral  osteoarthritis  on initial radiographs  does not typically  require  additional  imaging  
unless additional pathology  is suspected,  such as a rotator  cuff tear or surgery  is a consideration . 
Bone  Scan  Shoulder  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of bone  scan shoulder  in the evaluation  of chronic  shoulder  pain 
when  initial radiographs  demonstrate  osteoarthritis.  
CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
CT arthrography  can be helpful  in the preoperative  planning  of total shoulder  arthroplasty  in patients  with severe 
glenohumeral  arthritis. CT arthrography  provides  excellent  imaging  of osseous detail allowing  for characterization  
of glenoid morphology,  version,  and bone  loss. Unlike  nonarthrogram  CT, CT arthrography  allows for adequate  
characterization  of a rotator  cuff tear [16,17] , which  may alter the chosen  arthroplasty  type. Arthrogram  contrast  
also outlines  the articular  cartilage surface,  demonstrating areas of cartilage  loss, which  cannot  be directly  visualized

CT can be helpful  in evaluating  osseous morphology in cases in which arthroplasty  surgery  is under  consideration  
for treatment  of severe glenohumeral  arthritis. CT images are commonly obtained to classify  the morphology of the 
glenoid according  to the Walch  classification  system  [140] . CT measurements of glenoid version,  glenoid  bone  
loss, and humeral  head  subluxation demonstrate  high interrater  reliability  [141] . CT can potentially  demonstrate  
rotator  cuff muscle  fatty infiltration, which  is often  associated  with rotator  cuff tears;  however , overall  sensitivity  
for full thickness rotator  cuff tears is only 20% for noncontrast  CT [19].

Intra -articular  cortico steroid  injection  using either  fluoroscopy or US guidance  is often  used in the conservative 
management  of glenohumeral  arthritis  [122]  and may be performed  in some  situations  before  advanced  imaging  is 
obtained.  The diagnostic  utility  of glenohumeral  cortico steroid  injection  for confirming osteoarthritis  as a source of 
pain is limited, because patients with osteoarthritis  have  a similar  degree of pain improvement  (74%  rate of clinically  
relevant  improvement  at 1 month)  as patients  with other  underlying  causes of shoulder  pain [23].

complications  associated  with reverse total shoulder  arthroplasties  are scapular  notching,  dislocation,  periprosthetic  
fractures,  glenoid baseplate failure,  and acromial  fractures [8,9] . 
Symptoms  relate d to postoperative  difficulties  include  activity -related  pain,  decreased  range  of motion,  and 
apprehension.  Some  patients  report  immediate  and persistent  dissatisfaction,  although others  report  a symptom -free  
postoperative  period followed  by increasing  pain and decreasing  shoulder  function and mobility  [10]. 
Imaging can play an important role in diagnosing  postoperative  complications  of shoulder  arthroplasties.  The 
imaging  algorithm  should  always begin with an assessment  of the hardware components,  alignment, and

Glenohumeral  osteoarthritis  is typically  well visualized  on conventional  radiographic  views,  without  the need  for 
special  views.  A standard  axillary  view can demonstrate posterior  subluxation of the humeral  head  and abnormal  
glenoid morphology in patients with severe osteoarthritis  [145-147] . A measurement  of the critical shoulder  angle  
can be drawn  on routine  AP radiographs  by measuring  the angle  between  a line along the glenoid  surface and a line 
from  the inferior glenoid to the lateral  acromial  margin;  patients  with a higher  measurement  may be at high risk of 
having a full thickness rotator  cuff tear [148] .

The presence  of glenohumeral  osteoarthritis  on initial radiographs  does not typically  require  additional  imaging  
unless additional pathology  is suspected,  such as a rotator  cuff tear or surgery  is a consideration . 
Bone  Scan  Shoulder  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of bone  scan shoulder  in the evaluation  of chronic  shoulder  pain 
when  initial radiographs  demonstrate  osteoarthritis.  
CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
CT arthrography  can be helpful  in the preoperative  planning  of total shoulder  arthroplasty  in patients  with severe 
glenohumeral  arthritis. CT arthrography  provides  excellent  imaging  of osseous detail allowing  for characterization  
of glenoid morphology,  version,  and bone  loss. Unlike  nonarthrogram  CT, CT arthrography  allows for adequate  
characterization  of a rotator  cuff tear [16,17] , which  may alter the chosen  arthroplasty  type. Arthrogram  contrast  
also outlines  the articular  cartilage surface,  demonstrating areas of cartilage  loss, which  cannot  be directly  visualized  
with conventional  CT. 
CT Shoulder  With  IV Contrast  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of CT shoulder  with IV contrast  in the evaluation  of chronic  
shoulder  pain when  initial radiographs  demonstrate  osteoarthritis.  
CT Shoulder  Without  and With  IV Contrast  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of CT shoulder  without  and with IV contrast  in the evaluation  of 
chronic  shoulder  pain when  initial radiographs  demonstrate osteoarthritis. 
CT Shoulder  Without  IV Contrast  
CT can be helpful  in evaluating  osseous morphology in cases in which arthroplasty  surgery  is under  consideration  
for treatment  of severe glenohumeral  arthritis. CT images are commonly obtained to classify  the morphology of the 
glenoid according  to the Walch  classification  system  [140] . CT measurements of glenoid version,  glenoid  bone  
loss, and humeral  head  subluxation demonstrate  high interrater  reliability  [141] . CT can potentially  demonstrate  
rotator  cuff muscle  fatty infiltration, which  is often  associated  with rotator  cuff tears;  however , overall  sensitivity  
for full thickness rotator  cuff tears is only 20% for noncontrast  CT [19]. 
FDG -PET/CT  Skull Base to Mid-Thigh 
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of FDG -PET/CT skull  base to mid-thigh  in the evaluation  of chronic  
shoulder  pain when  initial radiographs  demonstrate  osteoarthritis.  
Image -Guided Anesthetic +/- Corticosteroid  Injection  Shoulder  or Surrounding  Structures  
Intra -articular  cortico steroid  injection  using either  fluoroscopy or US guidance  is often  used in the conservative 
management  of glenohumeral  arthritis  [122]  and may be performed  in some  situations  before  advanced  imaging  is 
obtained.  The diagnostic  utility  of glenohumeral  cortico steroid  injection  for confirming osteoarthritis  as a source of 
pain is limited, because patients with osteoarthritis  have  a similar  degree of pain improvement  (74%  rate of clinically  
relevant  improvement  at 1 month)  as patients  with other  underlying  causes of shoulder  pain [23]. 
MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
The role of MR arthrography relative  to conventional  shoulder  MRI in the setting  of osteoarthritis  has not been  
specifically  studied .

MRI Shoulder  Without  IV Contrast  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of MRI shoulder  without  IV contrast  in the initial evaluation  of 
chronic  shoulder  pain.  
Radiography Shoulder  
Most  literature  suggests that radiographs  should be the initial imaging  study  in patients  with shoulder  pain [1,10] . 
Standard  radiographic  exam ination  consists of a combination  of different  projections  typically  including  
anteroposterior  (AP) internal  rotation,  AP external  rotation,  Grashey  (oblique  AP in the plane  of the glenohumeral  
joint), scapular  “Y,” and axillary  views [10]. Radiographs  can evaluate for unexpected  fracture,  unsuspected  
aggressive bony lesion,  osteoarthritis, inflammatory  arthropathy,  osteonecrosis,  or calcium  hydroxyapatite  
deposition.  Accurate  interpretation  of radiographs  can often  obviate  additional  imaging  or be complementary  to 
subsequent  imaging studie s. A high-riding  humeral  head  on radiographs  is highly associated  with chronic  rotator  
cuff tear [11], particularly  if seen in combination with sclerosis of the inferior acromion,  greater  tuberosity  cysts,  a 
lateral  acromial  spur, and cortical  irregularity  or sclerosis of the greater  tuberosity  [12-14]. 
US Shoulder  
The literature  suggests that radiographic  evaluation  should  generally  be the first imaging  study  ordered  in patients  
with shoulder  pain [1,10-14] . Some practitioners  may use ultrasound (US) as an initial imaging  study when  rotator  
cuff disease/impingement  is suggested  by the clinical  exam ination .",True

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
It has been  approximately  60 years since Sir John Charnl ey introduced the modern era of hip replacement  surgery  
[1]. Approximately  370,000 primary  total hip arthroplasties (THAs)  were performed  in the United  States in 2014  
[2]. Sloan  et al [2] estimated  that the volume of primary  THAs  would  increase to 635,000 procedure s annually by 
2030.  
Over  the years,  modifications  have  been  made  to attempt  to decrease  complications  such as loosening and wear  
with additional  fixation  techniques  (eg, osseointegration ) and articular  surfaces  (eg, metal  on highly  cross -linked  
polyethylene , antioxidant  doped polyethylene  liners,  metal -on-metal  [MoM], ceramic on polyethylene , and ceramic  
on ceramic articulations)  [3-5]. 
Second -generation  MoM prostheses were introduced in the late 1990s  [6]. These  prostheses were preferentially  
used for younger  patients  with osteoarthritis  [7]. However , reports  of high short -term  failure  rates led to recalls  and 
decreased  use [8,9] . These articulations  (and also metal  to metal  articulations  at the head  neck  [trunnion] and neck  
stem  articulation s of modular  components)  may result  in the release of metal  particles and metal  ions leading  to 
macroscopic necrosis,  osteolysis,  large sterile  hip effusions,  and periprosthetic  solid  and cystic masses termed  
“pseudotumors”  [10]. The umbrella  terms  adverse local  tissue reaction  (ALTR ) and adverse reaction  to metal  debris  
(ARMD ) have been  used to refer  to the spectrum  of findings  in failed  metal  on metal  articulations  [11-13]. The 
term metallosis  refers  to infiltration  of metallic  wear  debris  into periprosthetic  structures [14]. 
The most  common  causes  for surgical  revision  of THA  from 2012 to 2019 as reported  in the American  Academy  
of Orthopaedic  Surgeons  American  Joint  Replacement  Registry  were infection  and inflammatory  reaction  (19.3%),  
instability  (17.4%),  and aseptic loosening (15.8% ) [15-17]. Wear  or osteolysis was the cause for revision  in 7.5%.  
The imaging studies used to follow uncomplicated primary hip prostheses and to assess several prosthesis-related 
complications are reviewed . Separate discussions pertinent to imaging of MoM prostheses are included.  
Special Imaging  Considerations  
Ultrasound (US) : US has been  used for assessment  of soft tissues adjacent  to hip arthroplasties and, in contrast  to 
MRI and CT, is not affected  by prosthetic  artifacts.  US may be limited  in its ability  to assess deep  soft tissues.

Guideline: ACR imaging after total hip arthroplasty.pdf, Page: 11
Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 11 Imaging After Total Hip Arthroplasty  hip replacements and 33 patients  who had pain in the hip after arthroplasty  and radiologic  findings  consistent  with 
component  loosening (6 of whom  had infection ). All patients  with intraarticular  effusion  and extraarticular  
extension  had infection  (100%  specificity) . 
WBC  Scan  and Sulfur  Colloid Scan  Hip 
The role of combined leukocyte  and marrow  imaging  for diagnosing periprosthetic  hip infection  has been  studied  
by several  investigators.  Specificity  has consistently  been  high,  ranging from  88% to 100%.  Sensitivity  has been  
more  variable,  ranging  from  33% to 100%  [88,95,96,116,117] . 
Variant  5: Symptomatic  hip arthroplasty  patient,  infection excluded.  Additional  imaging  following  
radiographs.  
This variant  includes  wear,  loosening,  and osteolysi s. 
Bone  Scan  Hip 
Loosening:  Temmerman  et al [118,119]  reported  that when  infection  had been  excluded,  bone  scintigraphy could 
diagnose  aseptic loosening  in the acetabular  and femoral  components , with sensitivities  and specificities ranging 
from  81% to 88% and 50% to 74% versus 81% to 85% and 74% to 85%, respectively , for radiographs.  Hill et al 
[80] reviewed  the results of 3-phase bone  scans performed  on 100 patients  with a painful  hip prosthesis.  They 
reported that an abnormal scan could not differentiate aseptic loosening from infection. Although a normal result 
excluded aseptic loosening and infection, the ability of the bone scan to identify or exclude other conditions such as wear, osteolysis, and soft tissue abnormalities as the cause of the patient’s symptoms was not addressed. There 
is insufficient evidence to support the use of planar bone scans in the symptomatic hip arthroplasty patient in whom 
infection is excluded.  
Bone  Scan  with  SPECT  or SPECT/CT  Hip 
In 37 painful  hip arthroplasties,  the results of the bone  scan with SPECT/CT were comparable  to those  of MRI for 
detecting  polyethylene  wear,  periprosthetic  fracture,  infection , and aseptic  loosening.  MRI detected  21 soft tissue  
abnormalities, 14 tendon lesions (12 tendonopathies,  2 tears),  6 bursitis, and 1 pseudotumor.  In contrast , bone  scan 
with SPECT/CT found 1 soft tissue abnormality:  iliopsoas  tendinopathy,  which  also was identified  on MRI  [120] . 
In another  investigation , the results of bone  SPECT/CT changed  patient  management  in 13 of 19 (68%)  patients  
with painful  MoM hip prostheses,  all of whom  had undergone  previous  extensive diagnostic  workup  including  
radiographs,  CT, and MRI  that failed  to identify  the cause of pain.  Bone  SPECT/CT was positive  in 4 cases of 
loosening and negative  for hip pathology  in 6 cases in which possible  non– hip causes of pain (all in the spine)  were  
identified. In 3 cases,  a negative  result  guided the surgeon  to seek alternative  management  options.  The authors  
concluded that bone  SPECT/CT is useful  in patients  with painful  MoM  arthroplasties  in whom the cause of the pain 
is not identified  after conventional  clinical,  laboratory,  and imaging  evaluation  [121] .

and specificities of 73.1%  to 100.0%.  Albano et al [109]  found  lymph  node  assessment  (of the affected  compared  
to the unaffected  hip) identified  infected  implants  with high accuracies (up to 93.1%).  Galley  et al [110]  found 
periosteal  reaction, capsular  edema,  and intramuscular  edema after THA at 1.5T MRI with MAR  to have  high 
accuracy  in the evaluation  of periprosthetic  joint infection  (86%-91%  accuracy).  Schwaiger  et al [112]  were able to 
distinguis h patients  with infection  from  those  with loosening  using MRI features.  Soft tissue edema (sensitivity,  
86.7%  and specificity , >73.3% ), abnormalities  at both acetabular  and femoral  components  (sensitivity/specificity,  
66.7% /93.3% -100% ), and enlarged  lymph nodes  (80% /86.7% ) enabled  this differentiation .

Summary  of Recommendations 
• Variant 1 : Radiography pelvis and Radiography hip are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of chronic 
hip pain. These procedures are complementary (ie, more than one procedure is ordered as a set or simultaneously 
in which each procedure provides unique clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 2 : In the setting of chronic hip pain with negative or nondiagnostic radiographs, MRI hip  without IV 
contrast or US hip  is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for suspected noninfectious extra -articular 
abnormality, such as tendonitis or bursitis.  These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure 
will be ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 3 : In the setting of chronic hip pain with negative or nondiagnostic radiographs, MR arthrography hip 
or MRI hip without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for suspected impingement or 
dysplasia. These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be ordered to provide the 
clinical informatio n to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 4 : In the setting of chronic hip pain with negative or nondiagnostic radiographs, MR arthrography hip 
or MRI hip without IV contrast is usually appropriate to evaluate for a labral  tear. These procedures  are 
equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 5 : In the setting of chronic hip pain with equivocal or mild osteoarthritis by radiographs , MR 
arthr ography hip or MRI hip without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study to assess 
articular cartilage integrity. These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be ordered 
to provide the clinical information to  effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 6 : In the setting of chronic hip pain,  MRI hip without and with IV contrast or MRI hip without IV 
contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study when radiographs are suspicious for intra -articular 
synovial hyperplasia or neoplasia , including nodular synovitis, diffuse tenosynovial giant cell tumor, 
osteochondromatosis, or other synovial neoplasm . These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one 
procedure will be ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 7 : In the setting of concomitant chronic hip pain with low back or knee pathology or pain, Image -
guided anesthetic +/ - corticosteroid injection of the hip joint or surrounding st ructures is usually appropriate as 
the next imaging study to quantify the amount of pain arising from the hip when radiographs also demonstrate 
hip osteoarthritis.

Explanation: The context does not provide clear guidance on the appropriateness of MRI for this specific patient profile. While MRI can be useful for further assessment of hip pain, especially in cases where X-rays are inconclusive, the appropriateness in this case cannot be determined without more information.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Fractures of the proximal femur (commonly referred to as hip fractures)  are a frequent  source of morbidity and 
mortality in elderly osteoporotic patients [1]. Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type 
result in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men 
[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs 
will continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of 
life following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays 
in diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -
and long-term mortality [6-13]. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of hip fractures is critical. Hip fractures 
cannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded on the basis of physical exam ination  alone ; therefore , imaging plays a 
key role in early  and accurate diagnosis [14] . 
The biomechanics of proximal femoral and pelvic fractures that are a result of major trauma differs as these 
injuries may be seen in any age group, often with additional accompanying high-velocity injuri es of the abdomen 
and pelvis . Motor vehicle –related trauma is the most common  mechanism. Thorough evaluation of the hip may be 
superseded  in these instances by the need for resuscitation and diagnosis and treatment of more urgent associated 
vascular or solid organ injuries. Imaging plays an important role not only in the diagnosis of high-velocity 
fractures but also in characterizing fracture mechanism and morphology for treatment planning purposes.  
However, imaging of high-velocity hip fractures occurs in the context of a broader trauma evaluation. A full 
discussion of the broader imaging workup of blunt trauma is beyond the scope of this paper and will be covered in 
the upcoming ACR Appropriateness Criteria® titled “Major Blunt Trauma” and will be made available on the 
ACR website  when completed . 
Treatment  for both intra - and extracapsular proximal femoral fractures in the elderly is typically surgical fixation  
because of the risk of further fracture displacement and the dangers of prolonged immobilization in the elderly 
[15]. Joint replacement may be  performed for displaced fractures of the femoral neck where the risk of femoral 
head avascular necrosis is high. Fractures from high -force trauma are also commonly treated with surgical 
fixation for stability to reduce the risk of post -traumatic osteo arthritis. 
Discussion of Procedures by Variant  
Variant 1:  Acute hip pain. Fall or minor trauma. Suspect fracture. Initial imaging.  
Radiography Hip 
Radiography is the initial imaging modality of choice for assessment of acute hip pain with suspected fracture , 
with the more advanced imaging modalities reserved for instances of clinically suspected fracture in the setting of 
negative or equivocal radiographs. Radiographs are rapidly obtained and well tolerated by patients. When a 
fracture is demonstrated , freque ntly no more imaging is needed for treatment planning purposes [15 -17].

The role of combined leukocyte  and marrow  imaging  for diagnosing periprosthetic  hip infection  has been  studied  
by several  investigators.  Specificity  has consistently  been  high,  ranging from  88% to 100%.  Sensitivity  has been

from  81% to 88% and 50% to 74% versus 81% to 85% and 74% to 85%, respectively , for radiographs.  Hill et al 
[80] reviewed  the results of 3-phase bone  scans performed  on 100 patients  with a painful  hip prosthesis.  They 
reported that an abnormal scan could not differentiate aseptic loosening from infection. Although a normal result 
excluded aseptic loosening and infection, the ability of the bone scan to identify or exclude other conditions such as wear, osteolysis, and soft tissue abnormalities as the cause of the patient’s symptoms was not addressed. There 
is insufficient evidence to support the use of planar bone scans in the symptomatic hip arthroplasty patient in whom 
infection is excluded.  
Bone  Scan  with  SPECT  or SPECT/CT  Hip 
In 37 painful  hip arthroplasties,  the results of the bone  scan with SPECT/CT were comparable  to those  of MRI for 
detecting  polyethylene  wear,  periprosthetic  fracture,  infection , and aseptic  loosening.  MRI detected  21 soft tissue  
abnormalities, 14 tendon lesions (12 tendonopathies,  2 tears),  6 bursitis, and 1 pseudotumor.  In contrast , bone  scan 
with SPECT/CT found 1 soft tissue abnormality:  iliopsoas  tendinopathy,  which  also was identified  on MRI  [120] .

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
It has been  approximately  60 years since Sir John Charnl ey introduced the modern era of hip replacement  surgery  
[1]. Approximately  370,000 primary  total hip arthroplasties (THAs)  were performed  in the United  States in 2014  
[2]. Sloan  et al [2] estimated  that the volume of primary  THAs  would  increase to 635,000 procedure s annually by 
2030.  
Over  the years,  modifications  have  been  made  to attempt  to decrease  complications  such as loosening and wear  
with additional  fixation  techniques  (eg, osseointegration ) and articular  surfaces  (eg, metal  on highly  cross -linked  
polyethylene , antioxidant  doped polyethylene  liners,  metal -on-metal  [MoM], ceramic on polyethylene , and ceramic  
on ceramic articulations)  [3-5]. 
Second -generation  MoM prostheses were introduced in the late 1990s  [6]. These  prostheses were preferentially  
used for younger  patients  with osteoarthritis  [7]. However , reports  of high short -term  failure  rates led to recalls  and 
decreased  use [8,9] . These articulations  (and also metal  to metal  articulations  at the head  neck  [trunnion] and neck  
stem  articulation s of modular  components)  may result  in the release of metal  particles and metal  ions leading  to 
macroscopic necrosis,  osteolysis,  large sterile  hip effusions,  and periprosthetic  solid  and cystic masses termed  
“pseudotumors”  [10]. The umbrella  terms  adverse local  tissue reaction  (ALTR ) and adverse reaction  to metal  debris  
(ARMD ) have been  used to refer  to the spectrum  of findings  in failed  metal  on metal  articulations  [11-13]. The 
term metallosis  refers  to infiltration  of metallic  wear  debris  into periprosthetic  structures [14]. 
The most  common  causes  for surgical  revision  of THA  from 2012 to 2019 as reported  in the American  Academy  
of Orthopaedic  Surgeons  American  Joint  Replacement  Registry  were infection  and inflammatory  reaction  (19.3%),  
instability  (17.4%),  and aseptic loosening (15.8% ) [15-17]. Wear  or osteolysis was the cause for revision  in 7.5%.  
The imaging studies used to follow uncomplicated primary hip prostheses and to assess several prosthesis-related 
complications are reviewed . Separate discussions pertinent to imaging of MoM prostheses are included.  
Special Imaging  Considerations  
Ultrasound (US) : US has been  used for assessment  of soft tissues adjacent  to hip arthroplasties and, in contrast  to 
MRI and CT, is not affected  by prosthetic  artifacts.  US may be limited  in its ability  to assess deep  soft tissues.

Page Content: Similarly, Koff  et al [33] performed  4 
yearly  MRI examinations  of patients  with surface replacement  prostheses and found  evidence  of ALTR s in high-
functioning individuals  without  pain.  They  concluded that MRI should be considered  as part of the routine  patient  
follow -up protocol  to allow  early  detection  and follow -up of ALTRs . In 2 series,  comparison  of MRI results  to 
histologic  findings  showed  the sensitivity  of MRI for pseudotumors  to be 85% and 71%,  respectively,  and the 
specificity  to be 59% and 87%, respectively  [39,40] . Sensitivity  was greater  when  the MRI  examination  was 
performed  within  3 months  of the revision  surgery  (88%)  [39].",False

granulom as. Intravenous (IV) contrast  may be of help in defining abscess [23]. 
FDG -PET/CT  Skull Base to Mid-Thigh 
Reported  results for diagnosing periprosthetic  hip infection  have  been  inconsistent.  In some  investigations, the test 
has been  both sensitive (81% -95%)  and specific (89% -94%)  for infection  [82,86- 90]. The results of other  
investigations ; however,  have  been  less satisfactory,  with sensitivity  and specificity  ranging from  64% to 100%  and 
38% to 68% [91-93]. Delank  et al [94] reported  that although a negative  FDG- PET excludes  infection, a positive  
result  could not accurately  differentiate  infection  from  aseptic inflammation. Kiran  et al [92] performed  preoperative  
FDG-PET/CT on 130 painful  cemented  hip arthroplasties and reported  a sensitivity  of 95% and a specificity  of 38% 
for periprosthetic  infection. In this investigation, the false-positive  rate of FDG  PET/CT compared  with culture  
alone  was 77%.  
Comparisons  of FDG-PET with conventional  nuclear  medicine studies have  been  contradictory.  Some  investigators  
have  reported  that FDG-PET is more  accurate than bone  scintigraphy and labeled  leukocyte  and marrow  imaging,  
whereas other  investigators  have  reported the opposite  results [61,82,87,88,95,96] . 
Fluoride  PET/CT Skull Base To Mid-Thigh 
Based  on the available data,  fluoride  PET/CT does not appear  to offer any advantages over FDG-P ET/CT or 3-
phase bone  scintigraphy  for diagnosing periprosthetic  hip infection  [97-100] . 
Image -Guided Aspiration  Hip 
Although both false-positive  and false- negative  results may occur,  joint aspiration  with synovial  fluid  analysis  
remains probably the most  useful  test for confirming  the presence or absence of infection  and identifying the

of 96.4%  for joint aspiration  culture.  Hip aspiration  can be performed  using fluoroscopic,  US, or CT guidance  or 
without  image  guidance  [103-105] . Contrast injection has been described for  CT arthrography following joint 
aspiration  [106] . 
Specific  tests of retrieved  synovial  fluid  such as alpha-defensi n and polymerase  chain  reaction  for bacteria and

MRI Hip 
MRI can demonstrate  soft tissue and bone  features associated  with periprosthetic  infection , including inflammatory  
synovitis  that may have  a lamellated  appearance [108] , soft tissue edema,  lymphadenopathy,  fluid  collections , bone  
marrow  edema,  and periosteal  reaction  [72,109-112] . 
IV contrast  can be used to differentiate  phlegmon from  abscess and to define  sinus  tracts and communicating fluid  
collections  [72]. However,  IV contrast  is generally  not necessary  to make  the diagnosis  of infection  [72]. Evaluation  
of 19 patients  suspected  of having  infection  showed  noncontras t MRI to be highly  reproducible  in the detection,  
localization, quantification, and characterization  of fluid  collections  [113] .

includes  major  and minor  criteria  but not specifically  imaging criteria  [75]. 
Bone  Scan  and Gallium  Scan  Hip 
The most  recent  data on bone  and gallium  scans for diagnosing periprosthetic  hip infection  are more  than 25 years  
old because this test has been  largely  replaced  by labeled  leukocyte  and marrow  imaging  and FDG -PET [77-79].

Bone  Scan  Hip 
Bone  scan of the hip is sensitive but not specific for periprosthetic  hip infection.  Performing  the test as a 3-phase  
bone  scan does not improve  accuracy,  with reported  sensitivity  and specificity  ranging  from  29% to 88% and 50%

Schweizer  et al [83] retrospectively  studied  58 total hip prostheses,  including  31 symptomati c and 27 asymptomatic  
prostheses,  with bone  scan with SPECT/CT. SPECT/CT identified  the cause of pain in 19 (61%)  of the 31 
symptomatic  devices.  No pathology-specific uptake  pattern  was observed.  Although periprosthetic  uptake  was 
significantly  higher  in symptomatic  individuals  than in asymptomatic  individuals,  a normal  result  did not exclude  
pathology.

to the unaffected  hip) identified  infected  implants  with high accuracies (up to 93.1%).  Galley  et al [110]  found 
periosteal  reaction, capsular  edema,  and intramuscular  edema after THA at 1.5T MRI with MAR  to have  high 
accuracy  in the evaluation  of periprosthetic  joint infection  (86%-91%  accuracy).  Schwaiger  et al [112]  were able to

chronic  hip pain and FAI [50]. One other  study  demonstrated  that fluoride  PET can demonstrate acetabular  
contrecoup injuries  in patients  with FAI [51]. However,  increased  radiotracer  uptake  is a nonspecific  finding,  and,

2. Analysis of appropriate imaging recommendations:
According to the context information, MRI can demonstrate femoral periprosthetic fractures and stress reactions. However, it may be difficult to see a nondisplaced fracture on MRI if there is only mild associated marrow edema, and susceptibility artifact from the prosthesis may obscure the findings. MRI can also assess for trochanteric bursitis.

3. Recommendation:
Classification: MAY BE APPROPRIATE
Explanation: MRI can be useful in assessing for trochanteric bursitis and detecting femoral periprosthetic fractures and stress reactions. However, it may not be able to detect a nondisplaced fracture if there is only mild associated marrow edema, and susceptibility artifact from the prosthesis may obscure the findings.

US Hip 
The use of US  for evaluation of the acutely painful hip has been evaluated in a single study of 10 patients  with hip 
fractures [36]. Although US was able to identify trauma-related changes,  such as joint effusion , with 100% 
sensitivity , specificity for fracture reached only 65%. The authors acknowledged that performance might further 
decrease for examinations performed by sonographers and radiologists not experienced with musculoskeletal US . 
For this document , it is assumed the procedure is performed and interpreted by an expert.  Given the inability of 
US to comprehensively evaluate the bones and soft  tissues of the pelvis, there is not enough evidence to support 
the role of US  in the workup of radiographically occult hip fracture.

Loosening:  Temmerman  et al [118,119]  reported  that when  infection  had been  excluded,  bone  scintigraphy could 
diagnose  aseptic loosening  in the acetabular  and femoral  components , with sensitivities  and specificities ranging 
from  81% to 88% and 50% to 74% versus 81% to 85% and 74% to 85%, respectively , for radiographs.  Hill et al 
[80] reviewed  the results of 3-phase bone  scans performed  on 100 patients  with a painful  hip prosthesis.  They 
reported that an abnormal scan could not differentiate aseptic loosening from infection. Although a normal result 
excluded aseptic loosening and infection, the ability of the bone scan to identify or exclude other conditions such as wear, osteolysis, and soft tissue abnormalities as the cause of the patient’s symptoms was not addressed. There 
is insufficient evidence to support the use of planar bone scans in the symptomatic hip arthroplasty patient in whom 
infection is excluded.  
Bone  Scan  with  SPECT  or SPECT/CT  Hip 
In 37 painful  hip arthroplasties,  the results of the bone  scan with SPECT/CT were comparable  to those  of MRI for 
detecting  polyethylene  wear,  periprosthetic  fracture,  infection , and aseptic  loosening.  MRI detected  21 soft tissue  
abnormalities, 14 tendon lesions (12 tendonopathies,  2 tears),  6 bursitis, and 1 pseudotumor.  In contrast , bone  scan 
with SPECT/CT found 1 soft tissue abnormality:  iliopsoas  tendinopathy,  which  also was identified  on MRI  [120] . 
In another  investigation , the results of bone  SPECT/CT changed  patient  management  in 13 of 19 (68%)  patients  
with painful  MoM hip prostheses,  all of whom  had undergone  previous  extensive diagnostic  workup  including  
radiographs,  CT, and MRI  that failed  to identify  the cause of pain.  Bone  SPECT/CT was positive  in 4 cases of 
loosening and negative  for hip pathology  in 6 cases in which possible  non– hip causes of pain (all in the spine)  were  
identified. In 3 cases,  a negative  result  guided the surgeon  to seek alternative  management  options.  The authors  
concluded that bone  SPECT/CT is useful  in patients  with painful  MoM  arthroplasties  in whom the cause of the pain 
is not identified  after conventional  clinical,  laboratory,  and imaging  evaluation  [121] .

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 12 Imaging  After  Total  Knee  Arthroplasty  instability, polyethylene  liner wear,  and periprosthetic  fracture.  Osteolysis is a leading  cause of late TKA revision.  
Osteolysis,  also known  as particle  disease and aggressive granulomatosis,  occurs secondary  to macrophage  
phagocytosis  of particle  debris.  Debris originating  from  polyethylene,  cement,  and metal  can all be causes of cell-
mediated  inflammatory  response  and osteolysis [113] , but typically  polyethylene  is the most  common  cause.  Areas 
of osteolysis contain  granulation  tissue with phagocytosed particulate  debris  [21]. The incidence of osteolysis is 
higher  for cementless,  compared  with cemented  TKA  [114] . Osteolysis can occur  anywhere  but is more  common  
in the region  of the femoral  condyles  near the attachment  of the collateral  ligaments,  along the periphery  of the 
component,  and along  the access channels to the cancellous bone  of the tibia, including  screw holes  [114,115] . 
Patients  with osteolysis may be asymptomatic early  on but can go on to develop  pain,  swelling,  and acute synovitis.  
Although small  areas of osteolysis  may be monitored,  the presence of large areas  of osteolysis suggest  component  
loosening and may require  revision  surgery  [116] . Imaging can also help evaluate available bone  stock  in 
preparation  for revision  surgery.  Instability  refers  to abnormal  and excessive displacement  of the articular  surfaces  
of the prosthesis  [21]. Instabil ity usually  occurs because of surgical  error and/or  poor prosthesis selection  and often  
results in revision  surgery  an average of 4 years after the primary  arthroplasty  [21]. Severe instability  can result  in 
dislocation. In a 2014 review of 781 cases of prosthesis failure,  Sharkey  et al [12] found that instability  represented  
the third  most  common  cause of prosthesis failure  overall,  accounting  for 7.5%  of all cases.  The concepts of 
instability, malalignment, and loosening in TKA are closely  interrelated  [117] . When  malalignme nt of the joint is 
created  at the time of surgery,  minor  degrees of instability  can become a significant  problem.  By the same  token,  
instability, ongoing over time, can give rise to malalignment, which,  in turn, can lead to loosening.  Although 
ligamentous  balance/imbalance plays  a role in joint instability, it is not the only factor  accounting for stability  [118] . 
3-Phase  Bone  Scan  Knee  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  routine  use of Tc-99m  3-phase bone  scans for the assessment  of instability.  
Bone  scintigraphy may be helpful  in diagnosing loosening,  especially  when  obtained many  years after surgery  [62]. 
This delay  in maximum utility  is because of  the observation that positive  bone  scans are noted in 20% of 
asymptomatic knees 1 year after surge ry and in 12.5%  of individuals  2 years after surgery [61] . Serial  bone  scans 
may be more  helpful  than a single  examination  [119] . Generally,  increased  uptake  on the delayed  images  but not 
on the blood- pool phase is thought  to be due to loosening rather  than to infection  [60]. Normal  scans are most  
helpful  and are characterized  by a high NPV,  indicating  that loosening or infection  is unlikely.  A potential false  
negative ; however,  may occur  if there is loosening at the cement –prosthetic  interface that does not incite  new bone  
formation  [66].

3-Phase  Bone  Scan  Knee  
Radionuclide  3-phase bone  scans can demonstrate  increased  activity  at a site of periprosthetic  fracture  and can show  
fractures that are radiographically occult  [137, 138]. In older  osteopen ic individuals  with low rates  of bone  
remodeling,  it may take 48 to 72 hours  for the development  of increased  radionuclide  activity  at the site of fracture.  
Within  1 to 2 years after prosthesis surgery,  the differential  diagnosis  for increased  periprosthetic  activity  would  
include  postoperative  change;  however,  with serial  imaging,  this postoperative activity  should decrease over time,  
whereas activity  increasing  over time would be suggestive of a prosthetic  complication, such as a periprosthetic  
fracture,  aseptic loosening,  or infection. Therefore,  no conclusion should  be drawn  on an isolated  bone  scan unless 
it yields  a normal  study.

embolization. In rare instances,  geniculate and popliteal vessel  injuries  may occur  during surgery  [15].

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Total knee  arthroplasty  (TKA),  primarily  used to treat pain and improve  function in patients with symptomatic  
advanced  knee  osteoarthritis, is the most  commonly performed  joint replacement  procedure  in the United  States  
[1,2] . In 2012,  >670,000 knee  replacement  procedures  were performed  in the United  States  [3], which  represents 
an increase of 86% since 2003  [4]. It is estimated  that 4 million  patients  in the United  States  are currently  living  
with a knee  replacement  [5]. By 2030,  it is estimated  that the annual  demand  for primary  TKA  will grow  by 673%  
to 3.48 million  [6]. Factors contributing  to the rising  number  of TKAs include  population growth;  aging  and 
increased  longevity of the population;  expanded indications  for performing  TKA,  especially  in individuals  >65 
years of age; obesity;  decline in postprocedure  complications;  and increased  patient  demand  [7]. 
The patient  satisfaction  rate for TKA is relatively  high,  ranging  from  75% to 89% [8]. Around  10% to 30% of the 
patients  report  ongoing pain or are not satisfied  with the result  [9]. Factors,  which  contribute  to patient  
dissatisfaction , include  unmet  expectations,  functional  limitations,  and postoperative  complications  including pain 
[10]. Most  TKA  patients  expe rience improved outcomes  and long implant survival,  with long-term  TKA failure  
rates of <1% per year [5]. The growth in the number  of primary  TKA  procedures  has been  accompanied  by increased  
rates of TKA revision  procedures  [1]. Revision  procedures  for TKAs have  increased  by 5.4 procedures  per 100,000  
persons  per decade over the period from  1990  to 2002,  with a mean  revision  burden of 8.2%  [11]. Nearly  1.5 million  
of those  with primary  knee  replacement  are 50 to 69 years  of age, underscoring a large population at risk for revision  
surgery  and long-term  complications  [5]. Sharkey  et al [12] reviewed  781 revision  TKAs and found  the most  
common  failure  mechanisms  were  loosening (39.9%),  infection  (27.4%),  instability  (7.5%),  periprosthetic  fracture  
(4.7%),  and arthrofibrosis  (4.5%) . Infection  was the most  common  reason  for early  revision  (<2 years after the 
initial TKA) , and aseptic loosening was the most  common  reason  for late revision.  Compared  with a review  
performed  by the same  author  in 2002 [13], polyethylene  wear  is no longer  the major  cause  of failure , and the 
percentages of revisions  for polyethylene  wear,  instability, arthrofibrosis,  malalignment,  and extensor  mechanism  
deficiency  have  all decreased.",False

3-Phase  Bone  Scan  Knee  
Radionuclide  3-phase bone  scans can demonstrate  increased  activity  at a site of periprosthetic  fracture  and can show  
fractures that are radiographically occult  [137, 138]. In older  osteopen ic individuals  with low rates  of bone  
remodeling,  it may take 48 to 72 hours  for the development  of increased  radionuclide  activity  at the site of fracture.  
Within  1 to 2 years after prosthesis surgery,  the differential  diagnosis  for increased  periprosthetic  activity  would  
include  postoperative  change;  however,  with serial  imaging,  this postoperative activity  should decrease over time,  
whereas activity  increasing  over time would be suggestive of a prosthetic  complication, such as a periprosthetic  
fracture,  aseptic loosening,  or infection. Therefore,  no conclusion should  be drawn  on an isolated  bone  scan unless 
it yields  a normal  study.

Variant  2: Suspected  infection after  total  knee  arthroplasty.  Additional imaging  following  radiographs. 
Infection  is a serious complication  of joint arthroplasty  and is reported  in 0.8%  to 1.9%  of TKAs [43]. The frequency  
of infection  is increasing  as the number  of primary  arthroplasties increases [44]. Infection  may be acute  or delayed , 
with delayed  infection  defined  as occurring at least 3 months  postoperatively  [45]. In a series,  infection  was 
responsible  for 37.6%  of early  revisions  and 21.9%  of revisions  performed  >2 years after the initial operation [12]. 
Staphylococcus  aureus  and coagulase-negative  Staphylococcus  species,  including  Staphylococcus  epidermidis,  are 
the most  common organisms  associated  with these infections  [46]. Both  clinical  findings  and laboratory tests may 
serve useful  in addition  to imaging  studies.  Low-grade  or chronic  TKA  infections  may be difficult to diagnose  
preoperatively.  Duff  et al [18] noted that diagnosis  of infection  was not obvious  in 53% of knees before  revision  
arthroplasty.  Pain is the most  common  presenting  symptom  of infection, but pain is a nonspecific finding [47]. In 
acute infection,  findings  such as pain,  swelling,  warmth,  erythema,  and fever  are common,  whereas chronic  
infections  may be manifested  by pain alone  [44]. Night  pain or pain at rest is characteristic of infection, whereas  
pain on weightbearing  is more  characteristic of mechanical  loosening.  Some  authors  suggest  that infection  needs to 
be excluded  in all patients  with pain persisting  >6 months  after joint replacement  [18]. 
Laboratory findings  in the setting  of TKA infection  are often  nonspecific.  Peripheral  leukocyte  counts  are not 
elevated  in most  patients  with infected  prostheses.  Erythrocyte  sedimentation  rates (ESRs) are abnormal  in patients  
with infection, but this finding  may also be seen in uninfected  patients,  limiting  the usefulness of the test [48]. A 
retrospective review of 68 patients  undergoing hip and knee  revision  surgery  indicated  that C-reactive protein  (CRP)  
was significantly  higher  in patients  with infection  compared  with those  with loosening (sensitivity  of 79% for all 
prostheses) ; however , a normal  CRP  level  did not exclude  infection  [49].

Guideline: ACR imaging after total knee arthroplasty.pdf, Page: 7
Page Content: CRP  has a sensitivity  of 73% to 91% and 
a specificity  of 81% to 86% for the diagnosis  of prosthetic  knee  infection  when  a cutoff  of ≥13.5 mg/L  is used [44]. 
Although CRP  can be elevated  after surgery,  under  normal  circumstances  it generally  returns  to baseline within  2 
months  [44]. A large multicenter  study found CRP  and joint aspiration  to be the most  useful  tools  to diagnose  
infection  [50]. In an attempt  to construct  an algorithm  for evaluating  TKA infection,  Savarino  et al [51] found that 
abnormal  results  for at least 2 of 3 tests (CRP  [cutoff  0.93 mg/L],  ESR [cutoff 27 mm/h],  and fibrinogen  [cutoff  
432 mg/dL])  led to accurate results for the diagnosis  of infection  (sensitivity, 93%;  specificity,  100%;  accuracy,  
97%) . More  recently,  interle ukin-6  has also shown  promise  for diagnosing  infection , with higher  predictive  values 
than most  other  serologic  markers [52], and has shown  excellent  sensitivity  for detecting  infection  after TKA when  
combined with CRP  [53]. The American  Academy  of Orthopaedi c Surgeons  (AAOS ) guidelines  strongly  
recommend  the use of ESR, CRP , and serum  interleukin -6 testing  for patients  being assessed  for periprosthetic  joint 
infection  [54]. Serologic  tests can be hard to interpret  when  underlying inflamm atory  arthropathy is present  [28]. 
More  recently,  the use of an alpha -defensin  laboratory  test has been  described  for the diagnosis  of periprosthetic  
joint infection.  Alpha -defensin  is an antimicrobial  peptide  that is naturally  released  by neutrophils  responding to a 
pathogen in the synovial  fluid.  Used  as a biomarker  for infection  in synovial  fluid, it has been  demonstrated  to be 
highly accurate in the diagnosis  of prosthetic  joint infection, nearly  matching  the Musculoskeletal  Infection  Society  
definition  for prosthe tic joint infection  [55-57]. In a study by Deirmengian  et al [56] of 149 synovial  fluid  aspirates,  
synovial  fluid  alpha -defensin  tests alone  demonstrated  a sensitivity  of 97% and a specificity  of 96% for the diagnosis  
of periprosthetic  joint infection, and the combination of synovial  fluid  alpha -defensin  and CRP  tests demonstrated  
a sensitivity  of 97% and a specificity  of 100%  for the diagnosis  of periprosthetic  joint infection . A recent  review  
suggests the preoperative  workup for periprosthetic  infection  should include  serum  ESR rate and CRP , serum  D-
dimer,  synovial  fluid  culture,  cell count , and differential, leukocyte  esterase,  alpha -defensin,  and synovial  fluid  ESR 
[58].

FDG -PET/CT  Whole  Body  
FDG-PET/CT scans may be useful  for detecting  infection  after joint replacement.  FDG-PET images reflect  relative  
levels of glucose uptake  and thus reflect  the localized  level  of increased  metabolic  activity. Zhuang  et al [68] 
reported  that elevated  glycolytic  activity  causes  inflammatory  cells such as neutrophils  and activated  macrophages  
to be FDG avid at sites of inflammation  and infection.  Some  periprosthetic  uptake  may occur  because of marrow  
activity, and adding marrow  scanning  can increase specificity  [69]. In these instances,  the marrow  study would be 
performed  the next day using a different  camera type because  the marrow  scan relies on lower  energy photons  (PET, 
511keV;  Tc-99m,  140 keV).  Zhuang et al [68] studied 36 painful  knee  prostheses using FDG -PET and identified  
10 of 11 infected  cases but had false-positive  results in 7 cases (sensitivity  of 90.9%,  specificity  of 72%,  and 
accuracy  of 77.8%  for detecting  infection) . This was a lower  accuracy  than found in assessment  of hip prostheses.  
The cause for the large number  of false- positives  was not known.  Aksoy  et al [70] found a positive  predictive  value  
(PPV)  of 28% (15 of 54) for infection  in 54 patients  with painful  joint prosthesis (24 knee,  48 hip) using FDG -PET.  
Manthey  et al [71] reported  that, by analyzing  intensity  and periprosthetic  uptake  patterns on FDG-PET, accurate  
differentiation  among aseptic loosening,  synovitis, and infection  is possible . Kwee and Kwee [72] reports  FDG",False

benefit  in identifying  metastases  [31]. 
FDG -PET/CT  is considered  superior  to Tc-99m bone  scan in the detection  of osseous  metastases.  Literature  has 
concluded  this in both general  oncologic  and bone  sarcoma  populations  [30]. FDG -PET/C T is also superior  to CT 
imaging  in this regard.  Quartuccio  et al [22] studied  64 pediatric  patients  with bone  sarcoma  and found  greater  
accuracy  of FDG -PET/CT  (85%  accuracy)  versus  CT (44% accuracy)  in detecting  bone  metastases  during  initial  
staging  of patients  with Ewing  sarcoma.  There  are mixed  conclusions  when  comparing  FDG -PET/CT  versus  MRI  
whole  body  in detecting  osseous  metastases  in general  oncology  populations  [32-34]. In a small  study  of 20 patients  
with Ewing  sarcoma  comparing  FDG -PET/CT  with MRI  whole  body , a single  patient  had a false -positive  bone  
finding  on FDG -PET/CT.  Overall,  39% more  bone  lesions  in this study  were  identified  with MRI  whole  body  versus  
FDG -PET/CT  [35].

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 9 Malignant or Aggressive Primary Musculoskeletal Tumor  FDG -PET/MRI  Whole  Body  
There  is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of FDG -PET/MRI  in the evaluation  of pulmonary  metastases  during  
surveillance  of malignant  or aggressive  primary  musculoskeletal  tumors.  The inherent  decreased  spatial  resolution  
of MRI  compared  with CT raises  doubts  about  the ability  to identify  small  pulmonary  metastases  with FDG -
PET/MR I as accurately  as CT. MRI of the lungs  relies  heavily  on the ability  to minimize  respiratory  motion.  
Radiography  Chest  
Chest  radiography  is less sensitive  than CT chest  imaging  for the detection  of pulmonary  nodules.  Whooley  et al 
[57] found  that 83% of asymptomatic  metastases  were  detected  radiographically  with a positive  predictive  value  of 
92% and a negative  predictive  value  of 97%.  However,  the detection  of more  and smaller  pulmonary  metastases  
with CT versus  radiography  has definitely  not improved  survival  rates.  Although  radiography  is less sensitive  for 
detection  of lung metastases,  how that correlates  with clinically  significant  metastases  is less certain.  
Variant  4: Malignant  or aggressive  primary  bone  tumor.  Surveillance  for local  recurrence.  
The body regions covered in this clinical scenario are ankle, chest, elbow, shoulder, femur, foot, forearm, hand, 
humerus, knee, pelvis, tibia/fibula, and wrist.  
Local  recurrence  rates  following  primary  resection  of a malignant  or aggressive  bone  tumor  vary and depend on 
tumor  grade  and histology.  Local  recurrence  rates  of bone  sarcomas  are reported  to be approximately  10% to 15% 
in patients  with osteosarcoma  and Ewing  sarcoma  [58-61]. Prognosis  is poor for locally  recurrent  malignant  or 
aggressive  bone  tumors,  with postrecurrence  5-year survival  rates  reported  approximately  15% to 30% in patients  
with osteosarcoma  and 5% in patients  with Ewing  sarcoma  [60,62] . Factors  associated  with poorer  prognosis  in 
patients  with osteosarcoma  were  size of local  recurrence  (>5 cm) and presence  of distant  metastasis  [60]. 
Recommendations  for local  recurrence  surveillance  imaging  vary amongst  expert  guidelines,  although  all 
acknowledge  the benefit  of clinical  evaluation.  Locally  recurrent  bone  tumors  can often  present  as a soft tissue  
mass,  and in a study  of osteosarcoma  local  recurrences,  the majority  (approximately  75%)  were  soft tissue  masses  
rather  than bone  lesions  [60]. Some  guidelines  recommend  clinical  exam ination  to be performed  solely , whereas  
others  recommend  in combination  with imaging  [49,51,52,63] . Time  to recurrence  also varies  with tumor  histology.  
Most  osteosarcoma  local  recurrences  have  been  shown  to occur  within  5 years  of resection.  However,  late 
recurrence  of both osteosarcoma  and Ewing  sarcoma  have  been  reported  [60,61] . In a study  of locally  recurrent  
osteosarcoma,  survival  rates  decreased  from  30% at 5 years  to 13% at 10 years,  suggesting  long-term follow -up 
beyond  5 years  is beneficial.  Tumor  histology,  grade,  and clinical  scenario  remain  paramount  when  deciding  how 
to surveil  for local  recurrence.

Radiography Hip 
An ipsilateral hip radiograph is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with osteochondritis dissecans ( OCD) , 
loose bodies , or history of cartilage repair.  
CT Knee  
CT without IV contrast may be  indicated  to evaluate patients with OCD or a history of cartilage repair , especially 
to confirm loose bodies or when MRI is not definitive.  
CT with IV contrast is not usually indicated to evaluate patients with OCD, loose bodies,  or history of cartilage 
repair.  
CT without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated to evaluate pati ents with OCD, loose bodies,  or history of 
cartilage repair.  
CT Arthrography  Knee  
CT arthrography may be used instead of MRI to evaluate the menisci, articular cartilage, and the presence of loose 
bodies [16].  
MRI Knee  
In patients with OC D or subchondral insufficiency fracture on radiographs, MRI without IV contrast may be 
indicated if an additional injury is suspected clinically or to clarify the status of the overlying articular cartilage 
[41]. A hyperintense rim or cysts at the osteochondral fragment periphery on MRI are less specific for OCD fragment instability in children compared to adults; however, MRI is still useful to determine the best method of 
treatment [41,50]. Following cartilage repair, MRI can grade the repair site and even guide the retrograde drilling 
of the OCD l esion [51-54] . 
MRI with and without IV contrast is not usually indicated  to evaluate patients with OCD, loose bodies,  or history 
of cartilage repair because of the  usual larger volume of joint fluid, the lesser degree of synovial invagination,  and 
the longer time required to achieve steady state gadolinium in the joint compared to the shoulder [16].  
MR Arthrography  Knee  
MR arthrography is typically  reserved for patients with known prior meniscal surgery, chondral and 
osteochondral lesions, prior cartilage repair procedures, or suspected loose bodies [10, 16]. 
US Knee  
US is not often useful as a screening test or a comprehensive examination.  It may be appropriate to localize 
suspected loose bodies, especially if the loose bodies might be within a popliteal cyst , lateral recess, or 
suprapatellar recess.  
Bone Scan Knee  
Radionuclide bone scan is usually not indicated to evaluate patients with OCD, loose bodies,  or history of 
cartilage repair.  
Image -Guided Aspiration Knee  
Joint aspiration is usually not indicated to evaluate patients with OCD, loose bodies,  or history of cartilage repair.  
Variant 4: Adult or child greater than or equal to 5 years of age . Chronic knee pain. Initial knee

of benefit  if metal  artifact  on MRI  cannot  be resolved,  although  it should  be noted,  CT is also susceptible  to artifact  
from  metal  hardware.  Although  IV contrast  does not provide  added  benefit  for evaluation  of bone,  given  many  bone  
sarcoma  recurrences  present  as soft tissue  masses,  IV contrast  can be useful  to increase  the conspicuity  of enhancing  
soft tissue  tumors.  However,  given  increased  radiation  dose without  clinical  benefit,  CT without  and with IV 
contrast  is usually  not recommended  over CT with IV contrast  alone.

FDG -PET/CT  Whole  Body  
FDG -PET/CT  has the added  benefit  of not only thin-slice CT imaging  but also the ability  to detect  metabolically  
active  disease.  FDG -PET/CT  is highly  accurate  in detecting  recurrent  soft tissue  and bone  sarcomas , and may be 
useful  as a problem -solving  tool when  other  imaging  of the area of interest  is equivocal . In a retrospective  single -
institution  study  of 53 patients  with skeletal  Ewing  sarcoma,  FDG -PET/CT  was found  to have a sensitivity  of 95% 
and a specificity  of 87% in detecting  recurrence  as a whole  with local  recurrence  accounting  for 90% of those  
recurrences.  Accuracy  further  increased  when  there  was clinical  suspicion  of local  recurrence  (84%  increased  to 
94%)  [64]. The degree  of metabolic  activity  as quantified  by SUV max has also shown  utility  for predicting  prognosis , 
with 1 study  of patients  with chondrosarcoma  identifying  a SUV max cutoff  of 6.15 to predict  significant  differences  
in survival  (P < .001)  [65]. A study  of postoperative  patients  with extremity  osteosarcoma  with endoprosthetic  
reconstruction  reported  that an SUV max >4.6 plus ΔSUV  >75%  after surgery  can reliably  distinguish  recurrence  
from  posttreatment  activity  that can linger  for 3 years  following  resection  [66].

osteonecrosis,  radiography will also show  findings  of secondary  osteoarthritis. 
Bone  Scan  Area  of Interest  
In recent  years,  bone  scintigraphy has been  replaced  by MRI for detection  of osteonecrosis because of  poor spatial  
resolution,  low specificity,  and the inability  to quantify size of the necrotic lesion  [29]. Single -photon emission  CT 
(SPECT) was shown  to improve  accuracy  of bone  scintigraphy  in a small  group of posttransplant  patients  [30], but 
radionucleotide  scintigraphy  is not commonly  performed  for detection  of osteonecrosis.  Early  limited  data for 
PET/ CT have not been  shown  to useful  in diagnosis  of early  osteonecrosis [31]. More  studies are needed  to see if 
PET/CT may be useful  in the detection  of multifocal osteonecrosis.

2. Analysis of appropriateness based on the context:
According to the ACR Appropriateness Criteria, MRI lumbar spine without and with IV contrast is typically not necessary in the evaluation of subacute or chronic low back pain without red flags or prior management. However, in patients presenting with subacute or chronic low back pain, with or without radiculopathy, who have failed 6 weeks of conservative therapy or if diagnostic uncertainty remains, MRI of the lumbar spine has become the initial imaging modality of choice. MRI can accurately depict lumbar pathology, including disc degeneration, as well as the thecal sac and neural structures. It may be helpful when there is low back pain with radiculopathy or signs of spinal stenosis, which suggests the presence of demonstrable nerve root compression.

3. Recommendation:
Classification: MAY BE APPROPRIATE
Explanation: The patient is presenting with subacute low back pain and has failed 6 weeks of conservative therapy. The MRI lumbar spine without and with IV contrast can help assess the compression fracture and provide further information about the extent of the injury and any associated nerve root compression.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 11 Low Back  Pain Discography  and Post-Discography  CT Lumbar  Spine  
Although the utility  of discography in patients  with LBP remains  controversial,  a systematic review by Manchikanti  
et al [32] provides  level  III evidence that lumbar  discography may be useful  in patients  with chronic  discogenic  
LBP. 
FDG -PET/CT  Whole  Body  
There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of whole -body FDG-PET/CT in the evaluation  of a surgery  or 
intervention  candidate with persistent  or progressive  symptoms  during  or following 6 weeks of conservative  
management  [28-30]. 
MRI Lumbar Spine With IV Contrast  
MRI lumbar  spine  with IV contrast  is not typically  performed  independently as an initial study,  as its interpretation  
is most  informative  when  correlated  with standard  noncontrast  sequences included in MRI lumbar  spine  with and 
without  IV contrast  [33]. 
MRI Lumbar Spine Without and With IV Contrast  
MRI with IV contrast  is typically  not necessary  in the evaluation  of a surgical  or interventional candidate with 
persistent  or progressive  symptoms  during or following  6 weeks of conservative management  but is sometimes  
useful  if noncontrast  MRI is nondiagnostic  or indeterminate.  Contrast  can help distinguish  residual/recurrent  disc 
from  fibrosis/scar  in a postoperative  patient  (see Variant  5). 
MRI Lumbar Spine Without IV Contrast  
Patients  presenting  with subacute or chronic  LBP or radiculopathy  who have  failed  6 weeks of conservative therapy , 
and with physical  examination  signs  of nerve  root irritation , should  be imaged  if they are believed  to be candidates 
for surgery  or intervention  or if diagnostic  uncertainty  remains.  Accurate diagnosis  of disc disease can be provided  
by MRI [7]. 
Although disc abnormalities are common on MRI in asymptomatic  patients,  LBP with radiculopathy or clinical  
signs  of spinal  stenosis suggests the presence of demonstrable  nerve  root compression  on MRI  [13]. In a study of 
symptomatic  patients,  there  was a higher  prevalence  of herniation . Fifty -seven  percent  of patients with LBP  and 
65% of patients  with radiculopathy  had disc herniation  as compared  with the 20% to 28% prevalence reported  in 
the asymptomatic series [7]. Interestingly, the size and type of disc herniation  and location  and presence of nerve  
root compression  were not related  to patient  outcome  [7,34] . 
Kobayashi  et al [35] have  shown  the utility  of MRI in diagnosing active spondylolysis  in radiographically occult  
spondylolysis.  
Radiography Lumbar  Spine  
Although  radiography  alone  is not sufficient  for guidance  on surgical  or interventional  options  without  MRI  and/or  
CT imaging,  it can be seen as compl ementary.  Upright  radiographs  provide  useful  functional  information  about  
axial  loading  [36]. The ability  to incorporate  flexion  and extension  radiographs  is essential  to identify  segmental  
motion,  which  is important in the surgical  management  of spondylolisthesis  [24,37] . Lateral  bending images have  
been  shown  to be helpful  in spinal  deformity  correction  surgery  [25]. 
Variant  4: Low  back  pain  with  suspected  cauda  equina  syndrome.  Initial imaging.  
CES is rare and results from  dysfunction of the sacral  and lumbar  nerve  roots  within  the vertebral  canal  secondary  
to cauda equina  nerve  root compression , producing impairment  of the bladder,  bowel,  or sexual  function and 
perianal  or saddle numbness.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 6 Low Back  Pain Table  1. Red Flags : Indications  of a more  complicated  status  include  back  pain/radiculopathy  in the following  
settings  (adapted  from  Bigos et al  [8]). 
Red Flag  Potential  Underlying  Condition  as Cause  of LBP  
• History  of cancer  
• Unexplained  weight  loss 
• Immunosuppression 
• Urinary  infection  
• Intravenous  drug use 
• Prolonged  use of corticosteroids 
• Back  pain not improved with conservative  
management  • Cancer  or infection  
• History  of significant  trauma  
• Minor  fall or heavy  lift in a potentially  osteoporotic  
or elderly  individual  
• Prolonged  use of steroids  • Spinal fracture  
• Acute  onset  of urinary  retention  or overflow  
incontinence  
• Loss of anal sphincter  tone or fecal  incontinence  
• Saddle  anesthesia  
• Bilateral  or progressive  weakness in the lower  
limbs  • Cauda  equina  syndrome  or other  severe neurologic  
condition  
Previous  guidelines  have  suggested  that imaging  be performed  in adults  >50 years of age who present  with LBP. 
When  studied,  there was no statistically  significant  difference in primary  outcome  after 1 year for patients  aged  65 
years or older  who had spine  imaging  within  6 weeks after an initial  visit for care for LBP versus similar  patients  
who did not undergo early  imaging  [9]; thus,  this document  does not include  >50 years of age as an independent  
red flag. However, an important age-related risk factor for spinal fracture presenting as LBP  is osteoporosis.  As 
bone mass decreases slowly over time, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age, and differs by sex, race, 
ethnicity  [10], and comorbidities. In line with the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations for patients  
ages 65 and older being screened for osteoporosis, patients  >65 years of age may be considered at risk for 
osteoporotic fracture when presenting with LBP . 
Additionally,  for those  patients without  neurologic  compromise  and who present  with minor  risk factors for cancer,  
inflammatory  back  disease  (eg, ankylosing spondylitis), vertebral  compression  fracture,  or symptomatic  spinal  
stenosis,  imaging  should be considered  after a trial of therapy  [4]. 
In the majority  of patients, no specific pathology for LBP can be identified. Also,  studies have  shown  imaging  
abnormalities  in a substantial  number  of people  without back  pain [11-13]. The challenge for the clinician, therefore,  
is to distin guish the small  segment  within  this large patient  population that should be evaluated  further because of 
suspicion  of a more  serious  problem  or identify  pathology that requires intervention . 
Other  nonspine  causes of LBP can have overlap  in clinical  presentation,  including inflammatory  arthritis  and other  
systemic conditions , such as pelvic,  renal,  vascular,  or gastrointestinal  etiologies.  If an inflammatory  etiology  is 
suspected  as the cause of LBP, such as ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic  spondylitis, reactive arthritis, or 
inflammatory  bowel  disease– related  spine  disorders,  please see the ACR  Appropriateness Criteria® topic  on 
“Inflammatory Back Pain: Known or Suspected Axial Spondyloarthropathy ” [14]. 
Initial Imaging  Definition 
Initial imaging  is defined  as imaging  at the beginning of the care episode for the medical  condition defined  by the 
variant.

Guideline: ACR low back pain.pdf, Page: 16
Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 16 Low Back  Pain fractures.  Additionally, the distinction  between  malignant  and benign compression  fractures  can be assessed  on 
MRI.  The visualization  of the convex  posterior  vertebral  body  border,  extension  into the posterior  elements,  and 
abnormal  marrow  signal  are suggestive  of pathologic  fracture  [58]. 
Radiography Lumbar  Spine  
In patients  with history  of osteoporosis  or steroid  use, initial evaluation  with radiography  is useful  [55]. Radiography  
with anteroposterior  and lateral  radiographs  is useful  for assessing  LBP in patients  with low suspicion  of trauma  or 
minor  trauma  and patients  suspected  of having possible vertebral  compression  fracture.  Upright  radiographs  provide  
useful  functional  information  about  axial  loading.  Flexion  and extension  views can be performed  to evaluate for 
spine  stability. Evaluation  of the extent  of vertebral  body  comminution  is limited  on radiography,  particularly  in 
patients with osteoporosis.  
Variant  7: Low  back  pain  with  or without  radiculopathy.  One or more  of the following:  suspicion of cancer,  
infection, or immunosuppression. Initial imaging.  
A systematic review examining studies that used red flags  as an indication  for screening  found  that of all the red 
flags,  only a history  of cancer  has been  shown  to increase  the probability  of finding spinal  malignancy  [61]. In a 
patient  suspected  of having cancer,  MRI without  and with IV contrast  is considered  superior  in evaluation  of 
localizing  disease (intramedullary, intradural -extramedullary,  and extradural)  as well as assessing  extent  of the 
lesion.  For malignant/metastatic  disease,  both bony/marrow  involvement  and neural  compression  from  epidural  
tumor  are visualized  with high spatial  resolution  [62]. Although CT lumbar  spine  without  IV contrast  can be 
performed  to evaluate osseous  integrity  (eg, pathologic  fracture)  when  involved with tumor,  intradural  and spinal  
cord pathologies  are poorly  depicted  on CT. Bone  scan remains invaluable  when  a survey  of the entire  skeleton  is 
indicated  (eg, for metastatic disease) ; however , MRI offers  greater  specificity  than bone  scan,  with comparable  
sensitivity  and the added  advantage  of providing  anatomic detail  [63]. Although  osseous destruction , as well as 
identifying  lytic or sclerotic lesions can be detected  on radiography,  at least half of the bone must  be eroded  before  
there is a noticeable change on radiographs  [64]. Whole -body  FDG-PET/CT  is typically  not an initial imaging  study  
but can be used to evaluate for widespread  metastatic disease and can distinguish  benign versus malignant  
compression  fractures [65,66] . 
In a patient  with suspected  spinal  infection, MRI without  and with IV contrast  is preferred  because of its  high 
sensitivity  and specificity.  MRI can localize the site of infection  and assess the extent  of extradural/epidural  and 
paravertebral  involvement.  The addition  of IV contrast  with fat suppression  is invaluable  in identifying  epidural  
and paraspinal  abscess [65] and helps  distinguish  abscess from  phlegmon [67]. Again,  MRI allows the diagnosis  of 
infection  before  bone  destruction  is evident  on either  CT or radiography.  Noncontrast  and contrast -enhanced  MRI  
has the ability  to demonstrate inflammatory, neoplastic,  and most  traumatic  lesions , as well as to show  anatomic  
detail  not available on isotope  studies [68].

candidate  with  persistent  or progressive symptoms  during  or following  6 weeks of optimal medical  
management.  Initial imaging.  
In the absence of red flags,  first-line treatment  for chronic  LBP remains conservative therapy  with both 
pharmacologic  and nonpharmacologic  (eg, exercise,  remaining  active)  therapy  [19]. However,  patients  presenting  
with subacute or chronic  LBP, with or without  radiculopathy,  who have  failed  6 weeks of conservative therapy  
should be imaged  if they are believed  to be candidates for surgery  or intervention  or if diagnostic  uncertainty  
remains.  The goal of imaging  is to identify  potential  actionable pain generators that could be targeted  for 
intervention  or surgery.  MRI of the lumbar  spine  has become  the initial imaging  modali ty of choice in these patients. 
MRI has excellent  soft-tissue contrast  and accurately  depicts lumbar  pathology,  including disc degeneration , as well 
as the thecal  sac and neural  structures [7]. However,  it is well known that many  MRI abnormalities  can be seen in 
asymptomatic individuals  and that imaging  patients  in this category  is often  not beneficial  [7,11,13,21] . MRI  may 
be helpful  when  there is LBP with radiculopathy  or signs  of spinal  stenosis,  which  suggests the presence of

Summary of Literature Review  
Background/Introduction 
Chronic knee pain affects tens of millions of people  in the United States annually , with the pain sometimes highly 
disabling and often negatively impacting the patient’s quality of life. Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and 
it can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain 
with the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. 
Typically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain 
persists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  
imaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated 
that approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the 
prior year) radiographs [2 ]. 
This document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  ≥5 years of age.  The 
variants discussed include: (1) initial exam ination ; (2) initial radiograph is normal or demonstrates a joint 
effusion; (3) initial radiogr aph demonstrates osteochondritis dissecans (OCD), loose bodies or history of cartilage,  
or meniscal repair; (4) initial radiograph demonstrates osteoarthritis or chondrocalcinosis; and (5)  initial 
radiograph demonstrates signs of prior (chronic) knee injur y (ie, Segond fract ure, tibial spine avulsion, etc ).  
To evaluat e knee pain associated with other conditions, please refer to the following ACR Appropriateness 
Criteria® topic on:  “Osteonecrosi s of the Hip ” [3] for osteonecrosis,  “Acute Trauma to the Knee ” for acute knee 
injuries  [4], “Imaging After Total Knee Arthroplasty ” for patients with total knee arthroplasty  [5], “Soft-Tissue 
Masses ” for a patient with a suspected soft -tissue mass [6], “Primary Bone Tumors ” for a patient with a suspected 
or known bone tumor [ 7], and “ Chronic Extremity Joint Pain -Suspected Inflammatory Arthritis ” for patient with 
suspected arthritis  or synovitis [ 8]. 
Special Imaging  Considerations  
Knee radiographs  should include at least one frontal projection of one or both knees (anteroposterior, Rosenberg, 
or tunnel), a tangential patellar view , and a lateral view of the affected knee [2,9]. Standing radiographs more 
accurately reflect medial and lateral compartment cartilage loss than supine radiographs with the posteromedial and posterolateral joint compartments  more accurately assessed using a weight -bearing flexion posteroanterior 
radiograph [9,10].

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 9 Chronic Knee Pain  Radiography Hip 
An ipsilateral hip radiograph is usually  not indicated  to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous 
knee injury.  
CT Knee  
CT without IV contrast  may be indicated to evaluate the patellofemoral anatomy in the setting of chronic knee 
pain related t o repetitive patellofemoral subluxation , which can be suggested by a small osseous fragment along 
the medial patellar margin  on axial knee radiographs [15]. CT kne e without IV contrast may also be useful to 
confirm a prior osseous injury.  
CT with IV contrast is not usually indicated to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  
CT without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated to eva luate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous 
knee injury.  
CT Arthrography  Knee  
CT arthrography may be used to evaluate the menisci, articular cartilage, and the presence of loose bodies with 
reported sensitivities and specificities ranging from 86 % to 100%  [16,62-64 ]. 
MRI Knee  
MRI without IV contrast may be indicated when radiographs demonstrate a small osseous fragment along the 
medial patellar margin or if there is a clinical concern for prior or chronic patellar dislocation -relocation.  MRI can 
assess the integrity of the medial patellofemoral ligament and medial patellar retinaculum, define the extent of 
cartilage injury, and identify loose bodies [41].  MRI is useful for evaluating Osgood-Schlatter or Sinding -Larsen -
Johansson syndrome [41].  If the radiograph suggests prior anterior cruciate ligament  injury, MRI can effectively 
evaluate the menisci , but evaluation for associated cartilage lesions is less useful [65].  
MRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) 
osseous knee injury.  
MR Arthrography  Knee  
MR arthrography is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with s igns of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  
US Knee  
US is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  
Bone Scan Knee  
Radionuclide bone scan is usually not indicated to evaluate patients with signs of prior  (chronic) osseous knee 
injury.  
Image -Guided Aspiration Knee  
Joint aspiration is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  
Summary of Recommendations  
• Variant 1:  Radiographs  of the knee  are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of  chronic knee pain in 
patients greater than or equal to 5 years of age.  
• Variant 2:  MRI knee without  IV contrast is usually appropriate in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of 
age with chronic knee pain when initial knee  radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion.  
• Variant 3:  MRI knee without  IV contrast is usually appropriate  in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of 
age with chronic knee pain when initial knee radiographs demonstrate OCD,  loose bodies, or history of 
cartilage or meniscal repair.  
• Variant 4:  (1) MRI knee without IV contrast  or (2)  knee aspiration or (3)  CT knee without  IV contrast may 
be appropriate  in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of age with chronic knee pain when initial 
radiographs de monstrate degenerative changes or chondrocalcinosis. While MRI knee without  IV contrast 
may be appropriate more often, knee aspiration and CT knee without IV contrast may be appropriate in 
specific instances detailed in the narrative. On occasion, these ex aminations  may complement each other  with 
more than one being appropriate .

Bone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the 
subchondral bone.  New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or 
patients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee 
pain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the 
origin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. 
Subchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed 
spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to 
elderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs 
often initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, 
and progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is 
suspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria
® 
topic on “ Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae ” [28]. 
Some patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using 
quantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs 
exhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ]. 
Patellofemoral car tilage loss is also associated with chronic knee pain , with active knee pain correlated with 
BMLs [30,31]. Similar to CT, MRI can calculate various anatomic measurements associated with patellofemoral 
subluxation/dislocation and lateral patellofemoral friction syndrome [32-34]. Bone marrow edema in the classic 
location for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also 
differentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise 
therapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. 
Other etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat 
pad impingement syndromes, Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome, adhesive 
capsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes , 
and osteonecrosis [15, 19,36-45].  
MRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a 
joint effusion. However, contrast -enhanced images ma y be more accurate in diagnosing other causes of chronic 
knee pain , such as Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome, and adhesive 
capsulitis [15].  In particular, enh ancing synovitis thicker than 2 mm in Hoffa’s fat is correlated with peripatellar 
pain [46]. Contrast -enhanced MRI is also useful in quantifying the degree of synovitis and in evaluating 
conditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis [ 17,42,47,48].  
MR Arthrography  Knee  
MR arthrography performed with an intra -articular injection of dilute gadolinium solution is typically not 
indicated as a second exam ination  but rather reserved for patients with known prior meniscal surgery, chondral 
and osteochondral lesions , and suspected loose bodies  [10].",True

2. Analysis of appropriateness based on the context:
- MRI Hip Without and With IV Contrast: This imaging procedure may be helpful in distinguishing enhancing inflamed synovium from a bland joint effusion. However, it is not specifically mentioned for the evaluation of osteoid osteoma. MRI is more commonly used for intra-articular sources of pain such as synovitis, synovial chondromatosis, or neoplastic conditions. Therefore, it may not be the most appropriate imaging modality for confirming the finding of osteoid osteoma.

3. Recommendation:
- Classification: MAY BE APPROPRIATE
- Explanation: MRI without and with IV contrast may provide some information about the presence of osteoid osteoma, but it is not the most commonly used imaging modality for this condition. Other imaging modalities, such as CT scan, may be more appropriate for confirming the diagnosis of osteoid osteoma.

Intra -articular  sources of pain such as synovitis,  whether  inflammatory  (eg, Lyme  disease),  proliferative  (eg, 
synovial  chondromatosis),  or neoplastic (eg, chondroma),  are well demonstrated  on MRI.  It can be quite  difficult  
to distinguish  tenosynovial  giant  cell tumor  from  synovial  chondromatosis  and other  proliferative  synovial

Bone  Scan  Hip 
Although a bone  scan of the hip may be able to demonstrate pathology  about  the hip, it cannot  be used to quantify 
the amount  pain that is generated  from  the hip pathology.  
CT Arthrography  Hip 
Hip cartilage abnormalities  can be successfully  evaluated  by high-resolution CT arthrography  [18,90-93] . 
Visualization  of the degree of cartilage loss does not enable quantification  of the amount  of pain that is generated  
by the patient’s  hip pathology.  However,  the injection  of an anesthetic agent  along with the contrast  that is 
administered  for arthrography may help determine whether  intra-articular  pathology can account  for the patient’s  
symptoms  [13].

CT Arthrography  Hip 
The instillation  of intra-articular  contrast  may elucidate periarticular  soft tissue  abnormalities  such as labral  or 
capsular  pathology [16-18]. However,  CT arthrography is limited  for evaluating  the extra-articular  soft tissue 
pathology because of  the inherent  poor soft tissue contrast  of CT. Within  the limitation  of CT; however,  some  extra-
articular  pathologic  entities, such as a large,  distended  bursa  may be evident  on CT. Tendinous  pathology is not 
particularly  well depicted  on CT.

MRI Hip Without IV Contrast  
MRI without  IV contrast  is useful  for evaluating  soft tissues  given its high soft tissue contrast  resolution  [23].

Fluoride  PET/CT Skull Base to Mid-Thigh 
One study demonstrated  the potential use of fluoride  PET to demonstrate increased  bone  turnover  in the setting  of 
chronic  hip pain and FAI [50]. One other  study  demonstrated  that fluoride  PET can demonstrate acetabular

Radiography Hip 
An ipsilateral hip radiograph is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with osteochondritis dissecans ( OCD) , 
loose bodies , or history of cartilage repair.  
CT Knee  
CT without IV contrast may be  indicated  to evaluate patients with OCD or a history of cartilage repair , especially 
to confirm loose bodies or when MRI is not definitive.  
CT with IV contrast is not usually indicated to evaluate patients with OCD, loose bodies,  or history of cartilage 
repair.  
CT without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated to evaluate pati ents with OCD, loose bodies,  or history of

CT Arthrography  Knee  
CT arthrography may be used instead of MRI to evaluate the menisci, articular cartilage, and the presence of loose 
bodies [16].  
MRI Knee  
In patients with OC D or subchondral insufficiency fracture on radiographs, MRI without IV contrast may be 
indicated if an additional injury is suspected clinically or to clarify the status of the overlying articular cartilage 
[41]. A hyperintense rim or cysts at the osteochondral fragment periphery on MRI are less specific for OCD fragment instability in children compared to adults; however, MRI is still useful to determine the best method of 
treatment [41,50]. Following cartilage repair, MRI can grade the repair site and even guide the retrograde drilling 
of the OCD l esion [51-54] . 
MRI with and without IV contrast is not usually indicated  to evaluate patients with OCD, loose bodies,  or history 
of cartilage repair because of the  usual larger volume of joint fluid, the lesser degree of synovial invagination,  and 
the longer time required to achieve steady state gadolinium in the joint compared to the shoulder [16].  
MR Arthrography  Knee  
MR arthrography is typically  reserved for patients with known prior meniscal surgery, chondral and 
osteochondral lesions, prior cartilage repair procedures, or suspected loose bodies [10, 16].

US can have high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of full-thickness rotator cuff tears. However, there is conflicting evidence on the ability of US to diagnose partial-thickness rotator cuff tears. Since the patient has a history of trauma and is presenting with severe pain and swelling in the right shoulder, an ultrasound is usually appropriate to assess for any traumatic injury, including rotator cuff tears.

Noncontrast CT is unable to assess rotator cuff pathology in the acute setting.  
US Shoulder  
In the post -traumatic setting, US  has been shown to detect abnormalities, including rotator cuff tears [ 25]. In 
general, US can have high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of full -thickness rotator cuff tears [ 70-72] . 
There is conflicting evidence on the ability of US  to diagnose partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [17,22,24,44,72]. 
Similarly, although interobserver agreement in detection of full -thickness rotator cuff tears can be high, it is much 
more variable for detection of partial -thickness tears [73,74]. 
FDG -PET/CT  Skull Base to Mid-Thigh 
FDG-PET/CT is not routinely used  for describing  rotator cuff tears.  Indirect identification of symptomatic rotator 
cuff tears has been described on FDG-PET/CT  by decreased radiotracer activity in the muscles of the torn tendons 
and increased activity of surrounding shoulder girdle muscles due to muscle recruitment  [28,29]. However, FDG-
PET/CT  cannot describe the extent of rotator cuff tear or degree of rotator cuff atrophy, which are relevant for 
clinical management.  
Bone Scan  Shoulder  
Bone scintigraphy is not routinely used  for describing rotator cuff tears . Increased radiotracer activity has been 
associated with symptomatic rotator cuff tears [33]. However, bone scintigraphy cannot describe the extent of 
rotator cuff tear or degree of rotator cuff atrophy, which are re levant for clinical management.  
Variant 9: Traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs already performed.  Physical examination consistent with 
vascular compromise.  Next imaging study. 
The subclavian, axillary, and brachial arteries are uncommonly injured followin g fractures and dislocations about 
the shoulder; however, the consequences can be debilitating. Of these, the axillary artery is more likely to be 
injured in patients with proximal humeral fractures, and the risk increases in the presence of open fractures, 
shoulder dislocation, and fractures of the scapula and ribs [ 75]. No systematic or comparative data is available on 
detection of arterial injuries  in the post -traumatic setting.  
CT Shoulder  
Noncontrast CT may be able to demonstrate hematomas; however, it is not an adequate modality for evaluation of 
acute arterial compromise.  Contrast -enhanced CT using intravenous (IV) contrast can identify some vascular 
injurie s. However, contrast bolus timing and image reformatting using routine contrast -enhanced CT protocols is 
suboptimal for identifying and characterizing vascular injuries.  
CTA Shoulder  
CT angiography (CTA) is a specialized protocol for contrast -enhanced CT i n which image acquisition occurs 
during maximum arterial opacification by IV contrast. Thin -slice axial images of the region of interest is 
performed , which helps in detection of subtle vascular injuries. M aximum intensity projection (MIP) images in 
multip le planes are also commonly performed, allowing for long segments of vessels to be visualized on a single 
image . CTA is the preferred examination for evaluation of suspected arterial injury. It can delineate the extent of 
injury and has the added benefit of providing optimal assessment of osseous injuries  [76,77]. 
MRI Shoulder  
Because of  the length of time required for MRI, it is not the modality of choice for asses sment of acute arterial 
injury.  Both routine noncontrast and contrast -enhanced MRI protocols lack the spatial and temporal resolution as 
well as imaging plane orientation to identify and characterize most arterial injuries . 
MRA Shoulder  
MR angiography (MRA) is MR imaging tailored to evaluate for arterial compromise using sequences such as 
time-of-flight, phase -contrast, and dynamic postcontrast imaging.  MRA can produce 2D images or dynamic 3D 
images of the arteries that simulates arteriography.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Traumatic shoulder pain is shoulder pain believed to be directly attributed to a traumatic event, either acute or 
chronic. This pain may be the result of either fracture (the clavicle, scapula, or proximal humerus) or soft -tissue 
injury (most commonly of the rotator cuff, acromioclavicular ligaments, or labroligamentous complex). The 
incidence of traumatic shoulder injuries is difficult to determine because some injury types, such as low-grade 
acromioclavicular separations or acute rotator cuff tears, are likely under -reported because patients  do not seek 
immediate medical treatment. However, as with many traumatic injuries, traumatic shoulder pain tends to 
disproportionately involve young adults and male patients [ 1,2]. 
The etiology of traumatic shoulder pain can often be made based on clinical examination, radiographs, and 
mechanism of injury. Traumatic shoulder injuries can generally be separated into in juries requiring acute surgical 
management and injuries in which conservative management can be attempted prior to considering surgical 
treatment. Unstable or significantly displaced fractures and joint instability are injuries most likely requiring acute 
surgical treatment. Most soft -tissue injuries (such as labral tears and rotator cuff tears) can undergo a period of 
conservative management prior to considering surgery. However, in addition to the specific imaging findings 
related to a traumatic injury, indications and timing of surgical treatment of many traumatic shoulder injuries are 
dependent on patient age, comorbidities, current activity level, and expected activity level.  
Imaging of chronic shoulder pain is beyond the scope of this topic  and is cove red in the  ACR Appropriateness 
Criteria® on “Shoulder Pain– Atraumatic ” [3]. 
Discussion o f Procedures  by Variant  
Variant 1:  Traumatic shoulder pain. Any etiology . Initial imaging . 
Radiography Shoulder  
Radiographs are the preferred initial study performed in the setting of traumatic shoulder pain . They can delineate 
shoulder malalignment and most shoulder fractures [ 4,5]. A standard set of shoulder radiographs for trauma 
should include at least three  views: anterior -posterior (AP) views in internal and external rotation and an axillary 
or scapula-Y view. Axillary or scapula-Y views are vital in evaluating traumatic shoulder injuries as 
acromioclavicular and glenohumeral dislocations can be misclassified on AP  views [6,7]. Radiographs provide 
good delineation of bony anatomy to assess for fracture and appropriate shoulder alignment, which are the two 
primary concerns in management of acute traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs should also be performed upright 
since malalignment of the shoul der can be under -represented on supine radiographs [ 4]. Additional views, such as 
the Bernageau view, have been sho wn to be effective in demonstrating the degree of bone loss of the glenoid or 
humeral head [ 8]. 
CT Shoulder  
Computed tomography ( CT) is better able than radiogr aphs to characteriz e fracture patterns [ 9-11].

Guideline: ACR shoulder pain traumatic.pdf, Page: 8
Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 8 Shoulder Pain –Traumatic  Variant 2: Traumatic shoulder pain. Nonlocalized shoulder pain. Negative radiographs . Next imaging 
study. 
Appropriately positioned  radiographs can exclude shoulder dislocation and most displaced fractures as the 
etiology for post -traumatic shoulder pain. In the setting of normal shoulder radiographs, the most common causes 
of post -traumatic shoulder pain are soft -tissue injuries such  as rotator cuff and labral tears.  
MRI Shoulder  
Noncontrast MRI is a reasonable imaging study in the setting of acute nonlocalized traumatic shoulder pain and 
noncontributory radiographs. In the acute trauma setting, noncontrast MRI may be preferred to MR arthrography , 
as acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint effusion for assessment of intra -articular 
soft-tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic 
pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [34,35]. MRI is also sensitive for diagnosing bone marrow 
contusion and has  been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries in pediatric patients [ 36,37]. 
MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography has been found to be superior to noncontrast MRI in the diagnosis of labroligamentous and 
partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [17,19]. In the acute trauma setting, however, noncontrast MRI may be 
preferred to MR arthrography because acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint 
effusion for assessment of intra-arti cular soft -tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing 
extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [ 34,35]. MRI is also sensitive 
for diagnosing bone marrow contusion and has been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries 
in pediatric patients [ 36,37]. 
US Shoulder  
US has limited usefulness in patients with traumatic shoulder pain that cannot be localized to the rotator cuff or 
biceps tendon. I n the post -traumatic setting, US has been shown to detect abnormalities, including proximal 
humeral fractures [25]; however, recent studies on US performed for non specific shoulder pain have had 
conflicting results. US  for persistent shoulder pain after trauma has been found to diagnose significant pathology, 
primarily fractures and rotator cuff tears, in 90% of patients [ 25]. However, 40% of patients presenting with 
nonspecific shoulder pain were found to have no significant pathology on US [38]. Additionally,  US has been 
demonstrated to be inferior to MRI in assessment of labroligamentous, osseous, and rotator cuff pathology [ 17]. 
US can b e considered as a screening tool in patients with persistent nonspecific shoulder pain after trauma, 
particularly in an older patient population in whom rotator cuff tears are more common. However, a low threshold 
should be maintained for performing additi onal imaging in the setting of a noncontributory shoulder US  
exam ination . 
CT Shoulder  
CT has virtually no usefulness in diagnosing common traumatic soft -tissue injuries such as rotator cuff tears, 
labroligamentous injuries, and muscle tears. Although CT is  the gold standard for diagnosing and characterizing 
fractures, MRI has been shown to be equivalent to CT in diagnosing the nondisplaced fractures that are typically 
missed on radiographs.  
CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
CT is inferior to MRI and US  in diagnosing virtually all extra -articular traumatic soft -tissues injuries. CT is 
considered the gold standard in identifying fractures . However, MRI has shown to be equivalent to CT in 
assessing bone loss [12,18], and MRI is usually adequate for diagnosing the nondisplaced fractures that are 
typically missed on conventional radiographs. CT arthrography is able to reliably evaluat e for glenohumeral 
cartilage injury, SLAP tears, and labroligamentous injuries [ 12,39] but is generally considered inferior to MRI in 
diagnosing  rotator cuff and soft -tissue Bankart lesions [ 12].

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 12 Shoulder Pain –Traumatic  MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography is the preferred exam ination  for the evaluation of subacute shoulder dislocations or recurrent 
shoulder instability. MRI has been shown to have similar performance to CT in the evaluation of Hill-Sachs 
lesions and glenoid bone loss [12,18]. MR arthrography has also been found to be reliable in diagnosi ng anterior 
shoulder instability and labroligamentous injuries [58,59]. MR arthrography has specifically o utperformed 
noncontrast MRI in assessment of glenohumeral ligament and anterior labral injuries [ 17,19], which ar e 
commonly seen in shoulder instability. MR arthrogr aphy has also outperformed noncontrast MRI in diagnosis of 
rotator cuff tears [17,19], which is a common associated finding in older patients with shoulder dislocation. 
However, high sensitivities reported for MR arthrography in the detection of labral pathology may not be 
applicable to patients with clinically unstable shoulders. A retrospective review of 90 patients with clinically 
unstable shoulders selected for arthroscopy [ 60] found that MR arthrography had a sensitivity of 65% for 
detection of labral  tears. The authors proposed that this discrepancy with prior studies was the result of different 
patient selection criteria (clinically unstable in their study versus less-specific symptoms such as shoulder pain in 
others) and the interpretation of MR art hrography by experienced musculoskeletal radiologists [ 60]. For this 
document, it is assumed the procedure is performed and interpreted by an expert.  
MRI Shoulder  
MRI without contrast may be pre ferred to MR arthrography in the setting of acute shoulder dislocation when a 
post-traumatic joint effusion is present to provide sufficient visualization of soft -tissue structures. In the subacute 
or chronic setting, the glenohumeral joint effusion is usually too small to provide adequate joint distention for 
optimal assessment  of soft -tissue structures. Non contrast MRI has been shown to be inferior to MR arthrography 
in diagnosing labroligamentous and rotator cuff injuries [17,19]. Non contrast MRI performs comparably to CT in 
evaluating glenoid and humeral head bone loss [ 12,18], which may obviate the need for noncontrast CT . 
CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
CT arthrography is effective in evaluation of shoulder instability. CT arthrogr aphy is comparable to MR 
arthrography in the diagnosis of Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions [12] , and moderate agreement has been found 
between readers for diagnosing ant erior capsule laxity on CT arthrography. However, CT arthrography has been 
shown to be inferior to MR arthrography in assessing partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [12], which makes CT 
arthrography less desirable in older patients with dislocation/instability where rotator cuff tears are common. CT 
arthrography may be considered in a patient with shoulder dislocation/instabili ty and contraindication to MRI.  
CT Shoulder  
Noncontrast CT has historically been performed to assess bone loss in patients with recurrent dislocation or 
chronic instability. However, recent studies have shown MRI to be equivalent to CT in assessment of glenoid and 
humeral head bone loss [12,18], which places in question the need for noncontrast CT in the assessment of 
shoulder instability. Noncontrast CT is als o unable to assess rotator cuff and labroligamentous pathology 
commonly seen in shoulder dislocations/instability. In general, CT should be reserved for patients with a 
contraindication to MRI or patients in whom MRI assessment of bone loss is limited.  
US Shoulder  
There is no defined role for US  in the assessment of shoulder dislocation  or instability. There is a potential limited 
role for use of dynamic US in assessing Hill -Sachs lesion engagement [ 61].

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Traumatic shoulder pain is shoulder pain believed to be directly attributed to a traumatic event, either acute or 
chronic. This pain may be the result of either fracture (the clavicle, scapula, or proximal humerus) or soft -tissue 
injury (most commonly of the rotator cuff, acromioclavicular ligaments, or labroligamentous complex). The 
incidence of traumatic shoulder injuries is difficult to determine because some injury types, such as low-grade 
acromioclavicular separations or acute rotator cuff tears, are likely under -reported because patients  do not seek 
immediate medical treatment. However, as with many traumatic injuries, traumatic shoulder pain tends to 
disproportionately involve young adults and male patients [ 1,2]. 
The etiology of traumatic shoulder pain can often be made based on clinical examination, radiographs, and 
mechanism of injury. Traumatic shoulder injuries can generally be separated into in juries requiring acute surgical 
management and injuries in which conservative management can be attempted prior to considering surgical 
treatment. Unstable or significantly displaced fractures and joint instability are injuries most likely requiring acute 
surgical treatment. Most soft -tissue injuries (such as labral tears and rotator cuff tears) can undergo a period of 
conservative management prior to considering surgery. However, in addition to the specific imaging findings 
related to a traumatic injury, indications and timing of surgical treatment of many traumatic shoulder injuries are 
dependent on patient age, comorbidities, current activity level, and expected activity level.  
Imaging of chronic shoulder pain is beyond the scope of this topic  and is cove red in the  ACR Appropriateness

based  on MRI alone  [23], many  of which  are benign and thus would not warrant  fine needle aspiration.  Therefore,  
diagnost ic imaging  that includes  comprehensive  characterization  of the mass should routinely  be performed  before  
biopsy.  In fact, the National  Comprehensive  Cancer  Network  Clinical Practice  Guidelines in Oncology for Soft 
Tissue Sarcoma state that biopsy or fine needle aspiration  should be performed  only after adequate imaging  [24]. 
Variant  3: Soft tissue mass.  Nondiagnostic  radiograph  and noncontrast -enhanced  ultrasound. Next  imaging

The body regions covered in this clinical scenario include the neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, humerus/upper arm, 
shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist, hand, hip, femur/thigh, knee, tibia/lower leg, ankle, and foot.  
Of note, this variant addresses the scenario in  which radiographs and/or noncontrast US have been performed but 
did not sufficiently characterize a soft tissue mass. In addition, this variant presumes there are no contraindications 
to any imaging modality. Variant 4 specifically addresses the situation  of a contraindication to MRI.  
CT Area  of Interest  With  IV Contrast  
Although CT with IV contrast lacks the specificity afforded by MRI in many cases, it does provide useful staging 
data [32]. In a multi-institutional study of 133 patients  with primary  soft tissue malignancies,  Panicek  et al [32] 
found  no statistically  significant  difference between  MRI and contrast -enhanced  CT imaging  in determining  tumor  
involvement  of muscle,  bone,  joint, or neurovascular  structures.  Therefore,  CT with IV contrast  remains an 
important  adjunct  in the evaluation  of a soft tissue mass.  
The advent  of virtual noncontrast  reconstruction  with modern dual-source CT scanners allows  for acquisition  of a 
single  postcontrast  scan with reconstruction  of virtual noncontrast  images,  which  can preclude  the need  for a 
separate precontrast  scan phase [31]. Similar  to CT without  IV contrast  [21, 22], virtual noncontrast  imaging  allows 
distinction  of ossification  from  calcification  and identification  of characteristic patterns of mineralization  [29,30]  
and is particularly  useful  in assessment  of mass  mineralization  in areas where the osseous anatomy is complex  or 
obscured  and radiographs  would be less sensitive.  
CT Area  of Interest  Without and With  IV Contrast  
The advent of virtual noncontrast reconstruction with modern dual -source CT scanners allows for acquisition of a 
single postcontrast scan with reconstruction of virtual noncontrast images, which can preclude the need for a 
separate precontrast scan phase [31] . However, a traditional CT without and with IV contrast may be appropriate 
for characterization of mineralization in an anatomically complex area. Although  a multi-institutional study of 133 
patients  with primary  soft tissue malignancies by Panicek  et al [32] found  no statistically  significant  difference  
between  MRI and contrast -enhanced  CT imaging  in determ ining  tumor  involvement  of muscle,  bone,  joint,  or 
neurovascular  structures,  this study did not specifically  endorse  the usefulness of dual-phase CT without  and with 
IV contrast.  CT with IV contrast  remains an important  adjunct  in the evaluation  of a soft tissue mass.

for the initial evaluation  of a soft tissue mass.  
Image -Guided Biopsy  Area  of Interest  
The l iterature  does not support  the use of image -guided biopsy as the initial examination  for a soft tissue mass.  At 
least 20% to 25% of soft tissue masses can demonstrate features that allow  for confident  diagnosis  based  on MRI

includes  comprehensive  characterization  of the mass should routinely  be performed  before  biopsy.  In fact, the

Variant  2: Nonsuperficial (deep)  soft tissue mass.  Initial imaging.  
The body regions covered in this clinical scenario include the neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, humerus/upper arm, 
shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist, hand, hip, femur/thigh, knee, tibia/lower leg, ankle, and foot.  
Radiography Area  of Interest  
Initial imaging  assessment  of a suspected  musculoskeletal  soft tissue mass  should almost  invariably  begin with 
radiographic  evaluation  and is advocated  by ESMO -EURACAN [9]. Radiographs  remain  the modality  best suited  
for the initial assessment  of a suspected  soft tissue mass  and are the initial study  of choice for orthopedic  oncologists  
[25,26] . However,  radiographs  have  limitations  and may not reveal  an abnormality  when  a mass is small, deep -
seated,  nonmineralized,  or in an area with complex  anatomy  such as the flank,  paraspinal  region,  groin,  or deep  soft 
tissues of the hands  and feet [11]. 
US Area  of Interest  
The diagnostic  accuracy  of US is considerably  less when  lesions outside  the subcutaneous tissue are included.  It is 
also less reliable  for defining deep  masses in large anatomical  areas [27]. Although a recent  prospective  study of 
US accuracy  in the characterization  of 134 histologically  proven  deep  soft tissue masses showed  promising results,  
there were only a small  number  of malignancies in the study cohort , and the investigators  had a high level  of US 
expertise [28]. Therefore,  US is most appropriate  for superficial  masses that are small  (<5 cm) in size [13] but may 
be appropriate for deep soft tissue masses in specific settings, such as a deep mass in a thin patient .

The body  regions  covered  in this clinical  scenario  include  the neck,  chest,  abdomen,  pelvis,  humerus/upper  arm, 
shoulder, elbow,  forearm,  wrist,  hand,  hip, femur/thigh, knee,  tibia/lower  leg, ankle,  and foot. 
Radiography Area  of Interest  
Initial imaging  assessment  of a suspected  musculoskeletal  soft tissue mass  should almost  invariably  begin with 
radiographic  evaluation  and is advocated  by the European Society  for Medical  Oncology– European Reference  
Network  Clinical Practice  Guidelines  for rare adult  solid  cancers (ESMO -EURACAN)  [9]. Although often  
considered  unrewarding  by clinicians  without  musculoskeletal  expertise,  a study of the radiogra phic evaluation  of 
454 patients  with proven  soft tissue masses demonstrated  positive  results in 62% of cases,  with calcification  
identified  in 27% of cases,  bone  involvement  in 22% of cases,  and intrinsic  fat in 11% of cases [10]. Specifically,  
radiographic  findings  can be diagnostic  or highly  character istic,  such as in the identification  of phleboliths  within  a 
hemangioma,  the osteocartilaginous  masses  of synovial  chondromatosis,  or the peripherally  more  mature  
ossification  of myositis  ossificans,  to name  just a few. In addition, radiographs  can be diagnostic  of an unsuspected  
skeletal  abnormality  or deformity  that may manifest  as a soft tissue mass.  Even  when  a specific diagnosis  cannot  
be provided,  radiographs  may reveal  information  on the type and scope of mineralization, the presence or absence  
of unsuspected  foreign  matter,  or changes  within  the adjacent  bone.  In general,  radiographic  findings  related  to a 
soft tissue mass  can provide  helpful  insight  in determining  the next most  appropriate  imaging  modality  for further  
characterization.  Of note,  radiographs  may not demonstrate an associated  abnormality  when  a mass  is small, deep -
seated,  nonmineralized,  or in an area with complex  anatomy  such as the flank,  paraspinal  region,  groin,  or deep  soft 
tissues of the hands  and feet [11]. 
US Area  of Interest  
Ultrasound  (US)  has become increasingly  recognized  as an excellent  triage  tool for evaluation  of superficial  soft 
tissue masses [12-15]. This recognition has been  further  supported by a recent  prospective  study of 219 
histologically  proven  masses that showed  US had a sensitivity, specificity, positive  predictive  value,  and negative  
predictive  value  of 93.3%,  97.9%,  45.2%,  and 99.9%,  respectively , for discriminating  benign  from  malignant  
tumors  in the superficial  soft tissues [16]. The same group  of researchers had similar  results in an earlier  separate  
retrospective analysis of 247 histologically  proven  masses [17]. However,  although these results highlight  the 
benefits of US in the initial assessment  of superficial  masses,  the overall  number  of malignancies in both the 
prospective  [16] and retrospective [17] studies was very small  (12 patients  and 11 patients,  respectively).  Another  
recent  study of 42 histologically  proven masses concluded that MRI performed  after US does not frequently change  
the working diagnosis  or add diagnostic  value,  but again , this study only included  a small  number  of malignancies 
and the value  of MRI for these malignancies was not separately  addressed  in the study  [18].

US Area  of Interest  With  IV Contrast  
Although prospective studies have  emerged  suggesting  that US is accurate  in the discrimination  of benign from  
malignant  soft tissue masses,  the number  of malignancies in these studies was limited  [16,28] . Therefore,  the use 
of US for the final evaluation  and staging  of a deep  soft tissue mass  is not recommended.  
Variant  4: Soft tissue mass.  Nondiagnostic  radiograph and noncontrast -enhanced  ultrasound.  MRI  
contraindicated. Next  imaging  study.  
The body regions covered in this clinical scenario include the neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, humerus/upper arm, 
shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist, hand, hip, femur/thigh, knee, tibia/lower leg, ankle, and foot.  
CT Area  of Interest  With  IV Contrast  
CT has become a useful  technique  for the evaluation  of patients  who cannot  undergo MRI and is the modality  of 
choice in this scenario  [29]. In the evaluation  of suspected  tumors,  contrast  imaging  is especially  useful  in 
distinguishing vascularized  from  potentially  necrotic regions  of the tumor.  With  modern  CT technology,  
calcification  can usually  be distinguished from  vascular  enhancement.  
Of note, d ual-energy  CT is a relatively  newer  technology that has shown  utility  in evaluation  of soft tissue masses.  
Using  the differences in energy  attenuation  of soft tissue at 80 kVp and 140 kVp,  this technique  can allow  
reconstruction  of virtual noncontrast  CT images as well as significantly  reduce metal  artifact  in the assessment  of 
metal  implants,  improving the diagnostic  value  of imaging  in the surrounding soft tissues [49,50] . It has also shown  
application  in the assessment  of marrow  edema [51,52]  and has been  investigated  in the distinction  of marrow  
edema from  intramedullary  tumor  invasion [53]. Furthermore,  spectral  CT is emerging  as a useful  tool for 
distinguishing benign from  malignant  soft tissue masses [54]. 
CT Area  of Interest  Without and With  IV Contrast  
Dual-phase CT without  and with IV contrast  as the next imaging  study for the evaluation  of a soft tissue mass  may 
be appropriate when MRI is con traindicated . Although single -phase CT with IV contrast is considered most 
appropriate in this clinical scenario given the advent of virtual noncontrast reconstruction with modern dual -source 
CT scanners [31] , a traditional CT without and with  IV contrast can be helpful  for characterization of mineralization 
in an anatomically complex area.  
CT Area  of Interest  Without IV Contrast  
The l iterature  does not support  the use of a single -phase CT without  IV contrast  as the next imaging  study  for the 
evaluation  of a soft tissue mass  when  MRI is contraindicated.  However,  single -phase CT with IV contrast  is a useful  
technique  for the evaluation  of patients  who cannot  undergo  MRI and is the modality  of choice  in this scenario  [29]. 
In the evaluation  of suspected  tumors,  contrast  imaging  is especially  useful  in distinguishing  vascularized  from  
potentially  necrotic regions  of the tumor.  With  modern CT techno logy,  calcification  can usually  be distinguished  
from  vascular  enhancement.  Therefore,  CT without  IV contrast  is usually  not beneficial .

Variant  3: Malignant  or aggressive  primary  musculoskeletal  tumor  with  no suspected  or known  recurrence.  
Surveillance  for pulmonary  metastasis.  
Pulmonary  metastases  account  for the majority  of distant  metastatic  disease  in patients  with primary  extremity  
sarcoma  as a whole.  Risk of pulmonary  metastasis  varies  with tumor  histology  and grade.  Although  patients  with 
high-grade  soft tissue  sarcomas  develop  lung metastasis  at a rate of ~60%,  those  with low-grade  sarcomas  have  
lung metastasis  rates  <10%  [45,46] . Therefore,  guidance  regarding  modality  for lung screening  often  differ  between  
low-risk and high-risk patients.  There  is also debate  concerning  the frequency  of lung surveillance.  Given  most  
pulmonary  metastases  will occur  within  2 years  of primary  resection  [47], many  experts  support  more  frequent  
surveillance  initially  in the first few years  after diagnosis.  Surveillance  regimens  usually  de-escalate  to annual  
follow -up after 5 years  postresection  [48-52]. Although  these dynamic  protocols  are often  used,  a prospective  
randomized  trial of 500 patients  with resected  extremity  sarcomas  and no baseline  metastatic  disease  found  no 
difference  in overall  survival  or recurrence -free survival  between  groups  whether  surveilled  at 3 month  or 6-month  
consistent  intervals  [53,54] . Pulmonary  metastases  are associated  with a worse  prognosis  [45], and treatment  of 
these  pulmonary  metastases  can improve  survival  [8,10] . Identification  of pulmonary  metastases  is an essential  part 
of primary  musculoskeletal  tumor  screening.  There  is little to no variation  in the ability  of a certain  modality  to 
detect  pulmonary  metastasis  whether  performed  at initial  staging  (see Variant  1), surveillance,  or restaging  in the 
setting  of recurrence.",False

The likelihood  of developing osteomyelitis  without  an associated  wound or ulceration  is extremely  low. Almost  
all osteomyelitis  and soft-tissue abscesses of the diabetic  foot represent  areas of contiguous  infection  from  
adjacent  skin ulcerations and not hematogenous  seeding  [14]. Any imaging modality  performed  for this variant

fractures not revealed  on initial radiographs . Diabetic foot osteomyelitis  and neuroarthropathy  can be difficult  to 
differentiate  clinically.  The early  diagnosis  of neuropathic  disease prior  to the development  of radiographic  
change  is important, as these  patients  will be treated  with altered  footwear  and orthotics  to prevent  the progression

sesamoiditis and avascular necrosis [32,33] . 
The most commonly used imaging techniques in the diagnosis of Morton’s  neuroma  are MRI and US. It has been 
shown that MRI has a significant effect in the diagnostic and therapeutic decisions made by orthopedic surgeons 
thanks to an increase in their confidence levels and change in treatment [34] . MRI is believed to be a sensitive and 
reliable method to evaluate patients with metatarsalgia and Morton’s  neuroma  with a sensitivity of 87%, specificity 
of 100%, accuracy of 89%, PPV of 100% , and NPV of 60% in surgically treated patients [35] . In a meta- analysis,  
MRI had  a pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio , and negative likelihood ratio of 93%, 68%, 1.89,  
and 0.19, respectively [36]. Increased fluid within the intermetatarsal bursa, which suggest s bursitis, is well 
demonstrated on MRI [37] . Although the use of gadolinium does not seem essential to detect Morton’s  neuroma s 
[38], it may facilitate its detection  because of  the improved soft -tissue contrast [32,39] . 
MRI is widely accepted as the imaging study  of choice for diagnosis of plantar plate tears. In a prospective study, 
Sung et al [40] found high accuracy (96%), sensitivity (95%), specificity (100%), PPV (100%), and NPV (67%) for 
MRI with surgical correlation. In this study,  moderate concordance was found between tear severity on MR I and 
surgery with greater concordance at higher severity. A meta-analysis showed higher diagnostic accuracy for MRI 
than US for the detection of plantar plate tears with sensitivity and specificity for MRI of 95% and 54%, respectively 
[41]. MR arthrography improves visualization of pericapsular structures when compared to conventional MRI and 
therefore is useful in the diagnosis and characterization of planta r plate tears and abnormalities of related structures 
[42,43] . 
MRI may be helpful to diagnose Freiberg’s infraction and several nonspecific findings have been described in early 
and chronic stages [32,44] . There is no evidence in the literature suppor ting the routine use of contrast in the setting 
of avascular necrosis [45]. 
US Foot  
There is limited information available in the literature regarding the use of US in the diagnosis of sesamoiditis. US 
has been shown to be useful  in diagnosing tears of the sesamoid phalangeal ligament in the setting of t urf toe [46] . 
Morton’s  neuroma  and fluid-filled intermetatarsal bursae can be demonstrated on US. High -resolution US can 
approach the sensitivity of MRI in detecting Morton’s  neuroma s. Similar to MRI, US is considered a reliable method 
to evaluate patients with Morton’s  neuroma . US has the advantage of allowing clinical correlation during 
examination. High sensitivities for US and MRI (83% –96% and 82% –96%, respectively) with no significant 
differences between the two modalities were found in a meta- analysis [36]. Other authors have found higher 
diagnostic capabilities of US over MRI in the diagnosis of Morton’s  neuroma  with pooled sensitivity, specificity, 
positive likeli hood ratio,  and negative likelihood ratio of 90%, 88%, 2.77,  and 0.16 for US and 93%, 68%, 1.89,  
and 0.19 for MRI [47] . 
MRI is generally better , but US is also useful in the diagnosis of plantar plate tears. In a cadaveric study, an accuracy, 
sensitivity , and specificity of 79%, 78% , and 80% , respectively , were found for US [48]. With MRI as the reference 
standard, Gregg et al [49]  showed a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV , and accuracy of 91%, 44%, 93%, 35% , and 
85%, respectively , for US in the detection of metatarsophalangeal plantar plate tears in symptomatic subjects.

Conventional radiography can be useful to distinguish among different causes of chronic foot pain and is usually

The value of radiographs in the diagnosis of tarsal coalitions has been extensively demonstrated. Overall 
sensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs 
in the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral 
and oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar 
coalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs 
on the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have 
been found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable 
methods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  
Radiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review 
by Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for 
radiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.  
Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  
usually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, 
osteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite 
versus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess 
with radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton’s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other 
causes of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg’s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals 
or soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . 
Though radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in 
patients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The 
combination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a 
specificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15]. 
US Foot  
Ultrasound (US) is usually not indicate d as the first imaging  study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain, but may 
be performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of pathologic conditions of the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, 
and other conditions such as tarsal tunnel syndrome, Morton’s  neuroma , plantar plate tears,  and intermetatarsal 
bursitis. 
Variant 2: Persistent posttraumatic foot pain. Radiographs negative or equivocal. Clinical concern includes 
complex regional pain syndrome type I. Next imaging study.  
3-Phase Bone Scan Foot  
A 3-phase bone scan may be useful in cases of suspected complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type I reflex 
sympathetic dystrophy , and several imaging findings have been described.

Page Content: CT is also useful to 
evaluate nonunion of sesamoid fractures in symptomatic patients with persistent bone marrow edema on MRI. 
Abnormalitie s in sesamoid position, which may be present in turf toe, hallux valgus, or osteoarthritis can also be 
assessed with CT [29] . CT is considered a useful and reliable method to determine the extent of necrosis in 
Freiberg’s infraction, which represents the main determining factor in the outcome [30]. There is no evidence in the 
literature supporting the routine use of contrast -enhanced CT imaging in the diagnosis of any of the conditions 
discussed above. Given the use of conventional arthrography in the detection of plantar plate tears, CT arthrography 
could presumably be of use in this setting [31] . 
MRI Foot

and chronic stress related changes, and avascular necrosis, and a variety of MRI findings have been described in

MRI allows the visualization of bone marrow edema patterns, which improve s the detection of fractures in cases of 
negative or inconclusive radiographs [70] . The utility of MRI in the detection of radiographically occult Chopart 
fractures has been demonstrated by Almeida et al [64] . Baker et al [71]  analyzed 31 occult fractures involving the 
ankle and foot in h ockey players,  finding five occult fractures in the foot, all of which involved the navicular bone. 
Pierre -Jerome et al [72] found 79% of cuboid fractures in the diabetic population that were radiographically occult 
using MRI. MRI is also useful in the detection of occult fractures involving the fifth metatarsal bone (Jones fracture) 
and the subtalar join t [65,73] . There is no evidence in the literature supporting the routine use of contrast in the 
diagnosi s of occult fractures.  
MRI has replaced bone scans in the evaluation of symptomatic accessory ossicles. MRI allows optimal visualization 
of the bone marrow within the ossicle and visualization of the synchondrosis. Accessory ossicles may also be 
associated  with tendon pathology, which is also well assessed on MRI [74]. MRI allows clear demonstration of the 
findings often associated with posterior ankle impingement syndrome [75]. Contrast administration is not routinely 
performed when assessing symptomatic accessory ossicles on MRI; however, contrast within a disrupted 
synchondrosis may be demonstrated on MR arthrography stu dies [69]. 
US Foot   
Although not routinely performed, previous studies have demonstrated the role of US in the detection of occult foot 
fractures. On US, these can be seen as cortical irregularities and are frequently associated with soft -tissue injury in 
the acute or subacute setting. Wang et al [76]  demonstrated 24 cases of radiographically occult ankle and foot 
fractures in 268 patients. Of these, foot fractures were found most frequently in the calcaneus and metatarsals, and 
less frequently in the navicular, cuboid , and cuneiform bones.  
On US, several findings have been reported in cases of painful accessory ossicles, including patients with posterior 
ankle impingement syndrome ; however , optimal characterization of the synchondrosis is difficult on US [62] . High -
resolution US offers some advantages over other imagin g modalities because it allows dynamic exploration of the 
foot with further assessment of stability of the synchondrosis and tendon tears when present as well as direct clinical 
correlation and comparative evaluation with the asymptomatic foot [77] . Power Doppler US has proven useful in 
identifying increased blood supply in the setting of ankle impingement [78,79] . 
Variant 6: Chronic foot pain. Entrapment s yndromes. Radiographs negative or equivocal. Clinical concern 
includes Baxter’s neuropathy. Next imaging study.  
Bone Scan Foot with SPECT/CT  
There is no relevant  literature supporting the use of nuclear medicine studies in the diagnosis of Baxter’s neuropathy.  
CT Foot  
There is no relevant literature supporting the use of CT , either with or without contrast in the diagnosis of Baxter’s  
neuropathy.  
MRI Foot  
Compression of the infe rior calcaneal nerve or Baxter’s neuropathy manifests as denervation changes of the 
abductor digiti minimi muscle. Because of  its ability to demonstrate signal intensity changes in the presence of 
muscle denervation, MRI has been sho wn to be useful in the dia gnosis of patients with Baxter’s neuropathy and in 
the exclusion of other causes of foot pain [23] . However, fatty atrophy of the abductor digiti minimi muscle is not 
a specific sign of Baxter’s neuropathy and can be found in 4% of asymptomatic subjects [80]. Contrast 
administration is not routinely performed in the initial assessment of neuropathic syndromes.  
US Foot  
Compression of the infe rior calcaneal nerve or Baxter’s neuropathy due to calcaneal enthesophytes, plantar fasciitis,  
or varices can result in heel pain.

sesamoiditis and avascular necrosis [32,33] . 
The most commonly used imaging techniques in the diagnosis of Morton’s  neuroma  are MRI and US. It has been 
shown that MRI has a significant effect in the diagnostic and therapeutic decisions made by orthopedic surgeons 
thanks to an increase in their confidence levels and change in treatment [34] . MRI is believed to be a sensitive and 
reliable method to evaluate patients with metatarsalgia and Morton’s  neuroma  with a sensitivity of 87%, specificity 
of 100%, accuracy of 89%, PPV of 100% , and NPV of 60% in surgically treated patients [35] . In a meta- analysis,  
MRI had  a pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio , and negative likelihood ratio of 93%, 68%, 1.89,  
and 0.19, respectively [36]. Increased fluid within the intermetatarsal bursa, which suggest s bursitis, is well 
demonstrated on MRI [37] . Although the use of gadolinium does not seem essential to detect Morton’s  neuroma s 
[38], it may facilitate its detection  because of  the improved soft -tissue contrast [32,39] . 
MRI is widely accepted as the imaging study  of choice for diagnosis of plantar plate tears. In a prospective study, 
Sung et al [40] found high accuracy (96%), sensitivity (95%), specificity (100%), PPV (100%), and NPV (67%) for 
MRI with surgical correlation. In this study,  moderate concordance was found between tear severity on MR I and 
surgery with greater concordance at higher severity. A meta-analysis showed higher diagnostic accuracy for MRI 
than US for the detection of plantar plate tears with sensitivity and specificity for MRI of 95% and 54%, respectively 
[41]. MR arthrography improves visualization of pericapsular structures when compared to conventional MRI and 
therefore is useful in the diagnosis and characterization of planta r plate tears and abnormalities of related structures 
[42,43] . 
MRI may be helpful to diagnose Freiberg’s infraction and several nonspecific findings have been described in early 
and chronic stages [32,44] . There is no evidence in the literature suppor ting the routine use of contrast in the setting 
of avascular necrosis [45]. 
US Foot  
There is limited information available in the literature regarding the use of US in the diagnosis of sesamoiditis. US 
has been shown to be useful  in diagnosing tears of the sesamoid phalangeal ligament in the setting of t urf toe [46] . 
Morton’s  neuroma  and fluid-filled intermetatarsal bursae can be demonstrated on US. High -resolution US can 
approach the sensitivity of MRI in detecting Morton’s  neuroma s. Similar to MRI, US is considered a reliable method 
to evaluate patients with Morton’s  neuroma . US has the advantage of allowing clinical correlation during 
examination. High sensitivities for US and MRI (83% –96% and 82% –96%, respectively) with no significant 
differences between the two modalities were found in a meta- analysis [36]. Other authors have found higher 
diagnostic capabilities of US over MRI in the diagnosis of Morton’s  neuroma  with pooled sensitivity, specificity, 
positive likeli hood ratio,  and negative likelihood ratio of 90%, 88%, 2.77,  and 0.16 for US and 93%, 68%, 1.89,  
and 0.19 for MRI [47] . 
MRI is generally better , but US is also useful in the diagnosis of plantar plate tears. In a cadaveric study, an accuracy, 
sensitivity , and specificity of 79%, 78% , and 80% , respectively , were found for US [48]. With MRI as the reference 
standard, Gregg et al [49]  showed a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV , and accuracy of 91%, 44%, 93%, 35% , and 
85%, respectively , for US in the detection of metatarsophalangeal plantar plate tears in symptomatic subjects.

Variant 1: Chronic foot pain. Unknown etiology. Initial imaging.

There is no r elevant literature  to support the use of MRI as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot

Radiography Foot  
Conventional radiography can be useful to distinguish among different causes of chronic foot pain and is usually 
the first imag ing study in evaluating patients with chronic foot pain.  
The value of radiographs in the diagnosis of tarsal coalitions has been extensively demonstrated. Overall 
sensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs 
in the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral 
and oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar 
coalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs 
on the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have 
been found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable 
methods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  
Radiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review 
by Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for 
radiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.  
Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  
usually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, 
osteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite 
versus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess 
with radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton’s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other 
causes of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg’s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals 
or soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . 
Though radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in 
patients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The 
combination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a

Metatarsal -Phalangeal  Joint Injury  
The best initial imaging study  for evaluating  hallux  plantar  plate  disruption  after metatarsal -phalangeal  (MTP)  
joint injury  is weightbearing  AP, lateral,  and sesamoid  axial  views,  with addition  of comparison  radiographs  of 
the contralateral  foot [29].  Radiographs  may also indirectly  evaluate lesser  metatarsophalangeal  plantar  plate  
injury  [30]. The combination  of a positive  drawer  test coupled with transverse deviation  of the third  MTP  joint on 
radiographs  can be used to diagnose  high-grade  plantar  plate  tear of the second  MTP joint [31]. 
A forced  dorsiflexion lateral  view of the hallux  MTP  joint is recommended  if there is clinical  suspicion  of plantar  
plate  injury  of the first MTP joint [29]. 
Radiography Foot  with  Weightbearing  
The best initial imaging study  for evaluating  hallux  plantar  plate  disruption after MTP joint injury  is 
weightbearing  AP, lateral,  and sesamoid  axial  views  with addition  of comparison radiographs  of the contralateral  
foot [29,32] . 
CT Foot  
Studies  report  moderate to poor sensitivity  (25%–33%)  of radiographs  in detection  of midfoot  fractures [21] in 
Level  1 trauma  patients.  A study of 49 patients  with acute hyperflexion injuries  to the foot concluded that 
conventional  radiographs  including  weightbearing  images are not sufficient  for routine  diagnostic  workup and CT 
should serve as the primary  imaging  technique  for such patients  [33]. 
MRI Foot  
MRI is the most  sensitive modality  for the detection  of occult  fracture  and acute bone  stress changes [34,35] . MRI  
is not routinely  used as the first imaging study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the foot in setting  of suspected  
MTP joint injury  or occult  fracture.  Both  MRI and US are used in evaluating  soft-tissue injuries  of the foot in the 
setting  of acute trauma,  especially  when  radiographs  are noncontributory.  Both  modalities  have  a similar  
sensitivity  for acute soft-tissue  trauma  about  the ankle  and foot such as ligamentous  and tendinous  disruption [36-
38]. 
US Foot  
US is not routinely  used as the first imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the foot in the setting  of 
suspected  MTP joint injury  or occult  fracture.  US has been  shown  to be sensitive for the diagnosis  of acute tendon  
rupture  or tendon dislocation  in the foot [36,39,40] . 
Fluoroscopy  Foot  
In addition  to routine  radiographs , fluoroscopy  has been  suggested  in assessment  of a hallux  MTP joint injury  
with direct  fluoroscopic  evaluation  of sesamoid  tracking  distally  with great  toe extension  at the MTP joint on 
forced  dorsiflexion lateral  view or fluoroscopy  [29]. 
Variant  5: Adult  or child older  than  5 years of age. Acute trauma  to the foot.  Suspect  Lisfranc injury, 
tendon injury, or occult  fracture or dislocation. Radiographs  are normal  or equivocal. Next  imaging  study. 
CT Foot  
Lisfranc  Injury  
CT has been  advocated  as the primary  imaging  technique  in acute hyperflexion  injury  and high-energy  
polytrauma  (especially  if the patient is not able to bear weight)  [33,38,41- 45].

Guideline: ACR acute trauma to foot.pdf, Page: 7
Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 7 Acute Trauma to the Foot  injuries  in midtarsal  (Chopart) sprains,  which  frequently  accompany  acute ankle  injuries  [52,53] . If radiographs  
are negative,  MRI can be obtained in select  patients  with forefoot  pain because of its increased  sensitivity  for the 
early  detection  of metatarsal  head  subchondral  fracture  [54]. 
Lisfranc  Injury  
MRI has been  advocated  as a sensitive diagnostic  test in evaluation  of Lisfranc ligamentous  complex  (especially  
if the patient  is not able to bear weight),  and 3-D volumetric  acquisitions  have  proven superiority  over orthogonal  
proton  density  fat-suppressed  imaging [33,38,41- 45]. There is a high correlation  between  MRI and intraoperative  
findings  for an unstable  Lisfranc injury  [44]. In the patient  with a suspected  Lisfranc injury  and normal  
radiographs,  the literature  supports  further advanced  imaging  by MRI  and CT [21,33,43,46] . 
Turf Toe and Plantar  Plate Injuries 
MRI is the preferred  imaging method for evaluating  suspected  “turf  toe” and lesser  metatarsal  plantar  plate  injury  
by directly  evaluating  the soft-tissue structures of the capsuloligamentous  complex  as well as assessing  chondral  
and osteochondral  lesions [29,55,56] . 
Acute  Tendinous  Rupture  
MRI tends  to be used as a screening  tool when  one is not certain  of the specific tendon injury  or if concomitant  
osseous injury  is suspected.  Both  MRI and US have  been  shown  to be sensitive  for the diagnosis  of acute tendon  
rupture  or dislocation  in the foot [39]. In a surgically  confirmed  study,  MRI was shown  to have  83% sensitivity  
for diagnosing tendon and ligament  traumatic  injuries  about  the foot and ankle  [37]. 
US Foot  
The importance  of focused  US examinations  is emphasized  in the literature  [57,58] . Protocol -based  US evaluation  
identified  97.4%  of symptomatic abnormalities  in the distal  extremities  (including the foot),  with additional  
accuracy  obtained  with focused  examination  [57]. 
Lisfranc  Injury  
Although  the literature  evidence is limited, US may hold promise  as an alternative method to accurately  evaluate 
for a significant  Lisfranc injury  providing direct  and indirect  assessment  of the Lisfranc ligamentous  complex  as 
well as dynamic  evaluation  with weightbearing  as demonstrated  in a series of 10 patients  [59].  Dorsal  component  
of Lisfranc ligament  is amenable to direct  US evaluation  [59,60] , although this structure may not be critical  for 
stability  for the Lisfranc joint [20,32] . The physiologic  deformation of the dorsal  Lisfranc ligament  resulting  from  
functional  loading emphasized  the need  for normative  US data as well as proper  positioning  when  bilateral  
evaluation  is performed  [61,62] . 
Turf Toe and Plantar  Plate Injuries 
US in the sagittal  plane  best visualizes  the plantar  plate  between  the flexor  tendon and hyaline  cartilage of the 
metatarsal  head  [63]. US has shown  a 96% sensitivity  compared  with 87% sensitivity  for MRI  for the detection  of 
lesser  toe plantar  plate  tears;  however , both modalities  have  poor specificity  [64].  
Acute  Tendinous  Rupture  
Both  MRI and US have  been  shown  to be sensitive for the diagnosis  of acute tendon  rupture  or dislocation  in the 
foot [39].",False

2. Analysis of appropriate imaging recommendations:
According to the ACR Appropriateness Criteria, for a confirmed stress (fatigue) fracture, excluding vertebrae, a follow-up imaging study for ""return-to-play"" evaluation can be done using MRI without IV contrast. MRI can be used to predict the time to return to play in athletes and provides diagnostic and prognostic information. CT without IV contrast is not recommended as it does not provide prognostic information since the stress fracture is already confirmed. X-ray repeat is also not recommended as it does not give prognostic information.

Page Content: Correlat ion of  clinical history, pattern , and site recognition 
with radiographic findings  is usually specific [1,2,4,5,7]. Nevertheless, stress fractures are frequently occult on 
initial radiographs  [1], with conventional radiographs having a sensitivity of 15% to 35% [8]. Early radiographic 
findings are often nonspecific (subtle periosteal reaction , gray cortex sign) or even nonexistent. Late radiographic 
findings are often suggestive in appearance  and include  linear sclerosis (often perpe ndicular to the major 
trabecular lines), periosteal reaction , patchy endosteal sclerosis, and soft -tissue swelling . Additionally, 
radiographs may remain negative depending on the timing of re imaging , the patient’s metabolic bone status, and 
the type and lo cation of the fracture. Thus, radiographs are specific but significantly insensitive. Despite this 
limitation, all authorities agree that radiographs should be the initial imaging modality; if the findings are 
conclusive, no further imaging need be perform ed. 
Variant 2: S uspected stress (fatigue) fracture, hip. Negative radiographs. Next imaging study.   
Short -term (10  to 14 days) follow -up radiographs are more sensitive than initial radiographs secondary to overt

Fredericson et al  [48] retrospectively correlated return to activity with an MRI grading system based on the 
pattern of periosteal and marrow edema on T1-weighted  and fat -suppressed T 2-weighted sequences. Similar 
findings were confirmed in other studies  [49-51] , including  that the finding of abnormal cortical signal intensity 
or a fracture line was of prognostic value [ 51] and that MRI performed better in predicting return to activity than 
radiographs , bone scintigraphy, or CT [50,52]. 
A recent prospective study in university athletes found that MRI grading s everity, total-body bone mineral density 
evaluated by dual -energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and location of injury (ie , cortical or trabecular bone)  
were important variables for predicting time to full return to sport [ 31]. In this study, periosteal edema as 
described by Fredericson et al [ 48] was not associated with return to sport . Using the modified grading scale and a 
multiple regression model, for every 1- unit increase in MRI grade, the time to full return to sport increased by 
approximately 48 days [31] . Furthermore, trabecular st ress injuries (eg , femur neck and pubic bone ) were 
associated with a longer time to return to sport than cortical bone stress injuries. In addition, decreased bone 
mineral density leads to increased time to return to sport . Therefore, bone mineral density provides additional 
diagnostic and prognostic information [31]. The model of MRI  grade, trabecular versus cortical bone sit e, and 
total-body bone mineral density a ccounted for 68% of the variation in time to return to sport [ 31]. Although 
further studies are needed, optimization of bone mass may reduce risk of sustaining str ess injuries or possibly 
reduce recovery time i n athletes with these injuries.  
It should be noted that after a diagnosis of stress fracture is made, no additional imaging is typically performed. 
Patients are typically followed clinically until they are pain  free, at which time they can  increase activity in a 
controlled manner  [53]. 
Variant 6 : Suspected stress (in sufficiency) fracture , pelvis or hip. First imaging study.  
See variant 1.  Pelvic and hip insufficiency fractures have varied presentations and often insidious onset. Patients 
frequently present with intractable lower back or pelvic pain, with loss of mobil ity and independence  and 
symptom exacerbation with weight bearing [54]. Insufficiency fractures occur in patients with abnormal bone , be 
it from osteoporosis, irradiated bone, or resumpt ion of activity postarthropl asty as typical examples. Insufficiency 
fractures also occur at fairly predictable sites, including the sacrum , supra -acetabular ilium, superior and inferior 
pubic rami,  and pubic bone . Radiographs should be the initial imaging modality in patients with low back and/or 
pelvic pain. Anterior -posterior ( AP) and lateral lumbar spine and AP pelvis radiographs are usually obtained. 
Because of  overlying bowel gas, fecal material, vascular calcifications, sacral curvature, and/or copious soft 
tissue, the sensitivity of radiographs is low  [55]. Radiographs may be more likely to be negative initially in older 
or osteoporotic patients with insuffi ciency fractures, particularly when they occur in the pelvis or sacrum  where 
there is more overlapping soft tissue [ 17]. However, if the findings are conclusive for insufficiency fracture, no 
further imaging need be performed.  
Variant 7 : Suspected stress (insufficiency) fracture, pelvis or hip.  Negative radiographs. Next imaging 
study.

Guideline: ACR stress fracture including sacrum.pdf, Page: 9
Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 9 Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture  [8]. Detection of osseous change is more limited in areas covered by prominent overlapping soft tissue [17]. If the 
osseous reaction involve s cortical bone, then endosteal/periosteal callus may be visible with or without a fracture 
line through the cortex. If the trabecular bone is involved, then stress fractures are often more  subtle, progressing 
from patchy areas of increased density into linear areas of sclerosis, oriented perpendicular to the trabeculae.  
Although bone scans were regarded as the gold-standard examination for many years, MRI is extremely sensitive 
and demonstrates stress abnormalities as early as bone scintigraphy  and with as much sensitivity  [11-14] . The 
recent literature favors MRI as the procedure of choice for making an early diagnosis of both varieties of stress 
fractures [15-28]. In this regard, MRI outperforms radiography,  bone scintigraphy, and CT. Furthermore, MRI 
examination of an osseous stress injury contains  prognostic as well as diagnostic information  [30,31]. 
CT is not typically used as a first - or second -line imaging tool  but may offer an adjunctive role when other 
imaging modalities are equivocal  [23]. Although  superior to radiography, it is less sensitive than nuclear 
scintigraphy and MRI  [19]. 
Stress fractures in the femur most often occur in the femoral neck and represent up to 7% of all stress fractures  
[39]. Lateral “tension -type ” femoral neck stress fractures are inherently unstable and prone to displacement  [40] 
and are high-risk fractures, often necessitating percutaneous screw fixation  [41]. Medial “compression -type ” 
femoral n eck stress fractures are low risk [40] and can be treated with a non– weight -bearing  regimen  [42]. 
Finally, stress fractures of the femoral head are high  risk in healthy patients and , if not recognized promptly, have 
increased  rates of delayed union, nonunion, displacement, and avascular necrosis [17]. Given the importance of 
recognizing these high-risk fractures in the femoral head and neck, MRI is the preferred second -line study after  
initial negative  radiographs to prevent delayed diagnosis.  
Variant 3: Suspected stress (fatigue) fracture, excluding hip  and vertebrae. Negative radiographs. Next 
imaging study.  
See variant 2. Certain stress fractures are considered high  risk based on a tendency for nonunion or delayed union. 
High -risk stress fractures include the anterior tibial diaphysis, lateral femoral neck and femoral head (see variant 
2), patella, medial malleolus, navicular, fifth metatarsal base, proximal second metatarsal, tibial hallux sesamoid, 
and talus  [43]. 
The second -line test to diagnose a stress fracture should be guided by the location of the patient ’s pain and 
likelihood of high-risk injury. A follow -up radiographic examination has increased sensitivity compared to initial 
radiographs [8] but is less sensitive than MRI. MRI is extremely sensitive and demonstrates stress abnormalities 
as early as bone scintigraphy and with as much sensitivity [ 11-14]. The recent literature favors MRI as the 
procedure of choice for making an early diagnosis of both varieties of stress fractures [ 15-28 ]. MRI is also 
considerably more specifi c than bone scintigraphy [ 19,23]. Stress injuries in athletes that are not identified and 
managed in a timel y fashion can progress to more serious fractures. Preventive strategies, including identifying 
and modifying risk factors, may help deter progression to frank fractures [31,44,45]. 
A circumstance that deserves specific attention is the longitudinal stress fracture, particularly in the tibia. Up to 
25% may appear n ormal on radiographs, but CT or MRI findings are characteristic [ 13,46]. MRI is very sensitive 
to the bone marrow e dema accompanying these longitudinal fractures and may give a misleadingly aggressive 
appearance [38].

Guideline: ACR stress fracture including sacrum.pdf, Page: 8
Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 8 Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture  tomography (SPECT) is more accurate in diagnosing stress injuries than planar scintigraphy alone [ 10]. The 
objecti on to the studies quoting high accuracy for bone scintigraphy is that in all of them, positive bone 
scintigraphy is taken as the gold standard for detecting stress fractures and therefore sensitivity is 100%. 
However, depending on the staging criteria for bone scintigraphy pattern, the abnormalities may in fact be stress 
reactions rather than actual stress fractures [4,5,7]. Nonetheless, it is clear that bone scintigraphy shows stress 
fractures days to weeks earlier than radiographs in many instances and differentiates between osseous and soft -
tissue injury as well.  
Magnetic resonance imaging  
MRI is extremely sensitive and demonstrates stress abnormalities as early as bone scintigraphy and with as much 
sensitivity [11-14] . The recent literature favors MRI as the procedure of choice for making an early diagnosis of 
both varieties of stress fractures [15-28 ]. In this regard, MRI out performs radiography, bone scintigraphy, and 
computed tomography (CT). Fluid-sensitive sequences are the favored initial sequence for MRI screening [ 29]. 
With a small field of view, short tau inversion recovery and/or T1-weighted imaging will usually demonstrate a 
fracture line surrounded by edema. In the absence of an actual stress fracture, stress reaction or muscle/tendon 
injuries can be identified using fluid -sensitive sequences. Thus, MRI may be as sensitive as bone scintigraphy  but 
also considerably more specific [19,23]. Intravenous contrast is not needed for diagnosis and has yet to provide 
any additional information.  MRI examination of an osseous stress injury contains prognostic as well as diagnostic 
information [30,31]. 
Computed tomography  
CT is not typically used as a first - or second -line imaging tool in the workup of stress fractures  but may offer an 
adjunct role when other im aging modalities are equivocal [ 23], particularly in the pelvis or sacrum . Although  
superior to radiography, it is less sensitive than nu clear scintigraphy or MRI [19]. The benefit of CT seems to lie 
in its specificity, ranging from 88%  to 98% in a recent meta-analysis looking at diagnostic accuracy of imaging 
modalities for lower -extremity stress fractures, and thus may confirm a suspected stress fracture based on MRI  
[32]. However, CT does involve ionizing radiation, so it is typically used only when MRI is equivocal.  For the 
evaluation of stress fractures, intravenous contrast is not helpful as a part of CT examinations.  
Ultrasound  
There is limited evidence on the u tility of ultrasound in diagnosing stress fractures. Ultrasound is a first -line 
imaging modality in assessing muscles, tendons, joints, and nerves in the extremities  [33], so the radiologist 
should know the typical sono graphic appearance of stress fractures. S onographic findings of s tress fractures 
include  subcutaneous edema , periosteal thickening, cortical bone irregularity, local hyperemia  [33-35 ], and 
periosteal callus.  Overall, ultrasound appears to be more sensitive than specif ic [32], and similar ultrasound 
findings can be seen in osteomyelitis or neoplasm. Furthermore, ultrasound cannot evalua te the subcortical bone, 
so trabecular stress fractures may be missed. Although touted as cheap and quick to perform , it is limited a s an 
operator -dependent modality.  
Variant 1: S uspected stress (fatigue) fracture,  excluding vertebrae. First imaging  study.  
In the setting of new or repetitive athletic activity, fatigue fractures can develop in patients with normal bone. 
Furthermore, certain athletic activities often result in specific sites of fatigue  fracture, such as olecranon process 
fractures in javelin throwers and baseball pitchers, proximal femur and tibial stress fractures in runners, and  tarsal  
navicular stress fractures in basketball players [ 36-38] .",False

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
The Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention  National  Diabetes Statistics  Report  of 2017 states that 30.3 
million  people  in the United  States  have  diabetes (9.4%  of the population)  [1]. Diabetes-related  foot 
complications , such as soft-tissue infection, osteomyelitis , and neuropathic  osteoarthropathy,  account  for up to 
20% of all diabetic -related  North  American  hospital  admissions,  with up to $1.5 billion  spent  annually in the 
United  States  on diabetic  foot ulcer  care [2]. 
Neuropathic  changes in the foot are present  in about  1% of diabetics [3]. Neuropathic  osteoarthropathy  is a 
progressive  process affecting  the bones,  joints , and soft tissue of the foot and ankle.  Delay  in the diagnosis  may 
lead to derangement  of the bony architecture of the foot, deformity,  recurrent  foot ulcerations,  cellulitis,  
osteomyelitis , and amputation [4]. 
Imaging findings  should not be interpreted  in isolation. Clinical  features that suggest  osteomyelitis  include  an 
ulcer  area >2 cm², an elevated  erythrocyte  sedimentation  rate level  of >70 mm/hour,  positive probe -to-bone  test, a 
nonhealing  ulcer  for 6 months,  erythema,  fever,  and elevated  white blood cell (WBC) count  [2,5,6]. A negative  
probe -to-bone  test may exclude  the diagnosis  of osteomyelitis  with a high negative  predictive  value  [7]. The 
Infectious  Diseases Society  of American  recommends performing  the probe -to-bone  test on any diabetic  foot 
infection  with an open wound [8]. Deep  wound cultures correlate well with osseous cultures and provide  a 
sensitive method in assessing  and targeting  likely  pathogens  that cause osseous infections  [9]. 
For the diabetic  foot with a clinical  examination  suggesting crepitus where soft-tissue gas associated  with wet 
gangrene  is suspected,  please see the ACR  Appropria teness  Criteria® topic  on Suspected  Osteomyelitis,  Septic  
Arthritis, or Soft Tissue Infection  (Excluding  Spine  and Diabetic Foot)  for appropriate  guidance  [10]. 
Discussion  of Procedures  by Variant  
Variant  1: Suspected  osteomyelitis of the foot in patients  with  diabetes  mellitus. Initial imaging.  
Radiography Foot  
Radiographs  are useful  as the initial screening  examination.  They  evaluate anatomic detail  and previous  surgeries  
and are useful  to evaluate for other  causes of pain, such as radiopaque  foreign  body,  soft-tissue gas, fracture,  
degenerative changes,  neuropathic  arthropathy , or tumor.  Radiographs  are insensitive  in the detection  of early  
stages of acute osteomyelitis  [11]. Soft-tissue swelling  and obscuration  of the fat planes will precede osseous  
changes [12].

There is no relevant literature  to support  the use of single -photon emission  computed  tomography  (SPECT/CT) as 
the initial screening  examination  in diabetic  patients  with suspected  osteomyelitis  of the foot. 
Variant  2: Soft-tissue swelling  without  ulcer.  Suspected  osteomyelitis or early  neuropathic  arthropathy  
changes of the foot in patients  with  diabetes mellitus. Additional imaging  following  radiographs.  
The likelihood  of developing osteomyelitis  without  an associated  wound or ulceration  is extremely  low. Almost  
all osteomyelitis  and soft-tissue abscesses of the diabetic  foot represent  areas of contiguous  infection  from  
adjacent  skin ulcerations and not hematogenous  seeding  [14]. Any imaging modality  performed  for this variant  
should be able to identify  soft-tissue infections,  tumors  and abscesses,  early  neuropathic  arthropathy,  or subtle  
fractures not revealed  on initial radiographs . Diabetic foot osteomyelitis  and neuroarthropathy  can be difficult  to 
differentiate  clinically.  The early  diagnosis  of neuropathic  disease prior  to the development  of radiographic  
change  is important, as these  patients  will be treated  with altered  footwear  and orthotics  to prevent  the progression  
to deformity.  
US Foot  
US is of limited  benefit  in the detection  of adult  osteomyelitis  because of its inability  to penetrate the cortex  of the 
bone.

There is no relevant literature  to support t he use of nuclear medicine studies as the first imaging  study  in the 
evaluation of chronic foot pain.

There is no r elevant literature  to support the use of MRI as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot

Radiography Foot  
Conventional radiography can be useful to distinguish among different causes of chronic foot pain and is usually 
the first imag ing study in evaluating patients with chronic foot pain.  
The value of radiographs in the diagnosis of tarsal coalitions has been extensively demonstrated. Overall 
sensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs 
in the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral 
and oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar 
coalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs 
on the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have 
been found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable 
methods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  
Radiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review 
by Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for 
radiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.  
Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  
usually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, 
osteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite 
versus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess 
with radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton’s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other 
causes of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg’s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals 
or soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . 
Though radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in 
patients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The 
combination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a 
specificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15]. 
US Foot  
Ultrasound (US) is usually not indicate d as the first imaging  study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain, but may 
be performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of pathologic conditions of the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, 
and other conditions such as tarsal tunnel syndrome, Morton’s  neuroma , plantar plate tears,  and intermetatarsal 
bursitis.

The initial assessment for cervical spine injury should be done with a cervical spine CT, which is the preferred modality.

Therefore, MRI should not be considered adequate for excluding significant soft-tissue pathology in patients with signs or symptoms of cervical spinal cord or nerve root injury.

radiographs or noncontrast CT. Neurologic abnormalities. Next imaging study. 
CT Myelography Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
CT myelography can be performed to assess for traumatic spinal canal narrowing that is due to disc herniation or 
epidural hematoma and to assess for preganglionic nerve root avulsions. Ho wever, as with conventional CT, CT 
myelography is inferior to MRI in assessing cord contus ion, cord hemorrhage, and postganglionic nerve root 
injuries [40,41,43,57]. Performance of thoracolumbar CT myelogram can also be technically challenging, 
particularly in patients with suspected  unstable thoracolumbar spine injury. 
CT Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
CT does play a role in the initial assessment of thoracic and lumbar spine injury. However, CT is significantly 
inferior to MRI in identifying many soft-tissue pathologies,  such as cord contusion, epidural hematoma, and nerve 
root avulsions that can cause neurologic deficits re quiring surgical intervention [40,41,43,57]. Therefore, CT 
should not be considered adequate for excluding signifi cant soft-tissue pathology in patients presenting with 
thoracolumbar spine trauma and neurologic deficit. 
MRI Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
MRI should be performed in patients who have possible spinal  cord injury, in whom there is clinical concern for 
cord compression that is due to disc protrusion or hema toma, and in those suspected of ligamentous instability. 
MRI is valuable for characterizing the cause of myelopathy in  patients with spinal cord  injury. The severity of the 
injury—including extent of intramedullary hemorrhage , length of edema, and evidence of cord transection—
contributes to predicting outcome. Compression of the cord  by disc herniation, bone fragments, and hematomas is 
best displayed on MRI, and MRI may be used to guide su rgical interventions [41,43]. For these reasons, the MRI 
examination should include T2-weighted images as well as gradient-echo images. In the subacute and chronic 
stages after cord trauma, MRI can help define the extent of  cord injury. This is particularly important in patients 
who suffer late deterioration, which is sometimes cau sed by treatable etiologies like the development or 
enlargement of intramedullary cavities,  such as a post-traumatic syringomyelia. 
Although numerous research studies ha ve reported a potential value of diffusion MRI for characterizing spinal 
cord injury [111], technical problems have prevented wid espread application of this technique to human studies. 
The current utility of diffusion MRI for assessing cord trauma remains unknown. 
Summary of Recommendations 
 Variant 1: Imaging is not recommended for the initial imaging of patients ≥16 years of age and <65 years of 
age with suspected acute blunt cervi cal spine trauma when imaging is  not indicated by NEXUS or CCR 
clinical criteria and the patient meets low-risk criteria. 
 Variant 2: CT cervical spine without IV contrast is usually  appropriate for the initial imaging of patients ≥16 
years of age with suspected acute blunt trauma of the cervical spine when imaging is indicated by NEXUS or 
CCR clinical criteria. 
 Variant 3: MRI cervical spine without IV contrast is usua lly appropriate as the next imaging study for 
patients ≥16 years of age with suspected acute blunt trauma of the cervical spine and confirmed or suspected 
cervical spinal cord or nerve root injury, with or  without traumatic injury identified on cervical CT. 
 Variant 4: CT cervical spine without IV contrast and MRI cervical spine without IV contrast are usually 
appropriate for patients ≥16 years of age with acute cervical spine injury detected on radiographs and 
treatment planning for mechanically unstable spine.  These procedures are complementary in the assessment 
of unstable spine injuries.

Cervical spine CT is the preferred modality for the initia l assessment of cervical spine injury. However, CT is 
significantly inferior to MRI in identifying many soft-tissu e pathologies, such as spinal cord contusion, epidural 
hematoma, and nerve root avulsions, that can cause neur ologic deficits and require surgical intervention 
[40,41,43,57]. Therefore, CT should not be considered ad equate for excluding significant soft-tissue pathology in 
patients presenting with signs or symptoms of cervical spinal cord or  nerve root injury.

MRI Cervical Spine 
The utilization of MRI in obtunded trauma patients is contr oversial. The crucial issue is  “are risks associated with 
performing MRI in obtunded patients worth discovery of the rare case of unstable cervical spine injury in a 
patient with a cervical spine CT that shows no acute injury?” MRI is superior  to CT in identifying cervical spine 
ligament injuries [77]. Studies looking at the presence of so ft-tissue injury on cervical spine MRI in patients with 
unreliable physical or neurological examination and negativ e CT have found MRI to be positive in 6% to 49% of 
patients [41,44,45,47,48,78]. Most of these injuries were  minor, requiring either no ch ange in management or 
only extended cervical collar placement. However, approxi mately 1% of patients with an unreliable clinical 
examination and negative cervical spine CT will have an unstable cervical spine injury  that requires surgical 
stabilization identified on MRI [38-41,44-48,78-80]. When co mpared with the use of CT with MRI for clearance 
of the cervical spine in mechanically ventilated patients,  use of CT alone has been found to result in decreased 
length of intensive care unit stay, as well as decreased morb idity related to the rigid cervical collar and ventilation 
while demonstrating no missed unstable cervical spin e injuries or difference in patient mortality [80]. 
Furthermore, MRI has been found to have low (64% to 77%) specificity in identifying clinically significant 
interspinous ligament, intervertebral disc, and paraspinal muscle injury [62]. 
While not limited to obtunded patients, recent prospectiv e multicenter trials suggest that MRI has a role in 
evaluating patients who have a negative cervical spine CT. The Western Trauma Association Multi-Institutional 
trial reported that CT was effective for ruling out clinically  significant injury with a sensitivity of 98.5%. A small 
but clinically significant incidence of a missed injury was noted [56]. The prospective ReCONECT trial studied 
767 patients who had a negative cervical spine CT and we nt on to MRI because of cervicalgia (43.0%), inability 
to evaluate (44.1%), or both (9.4%). MRI was abnormal in 23.6% of all patients, including ligamentous injury 
(16.6%), soft-tissue swelling (4.3%), vertebral disc injury  (1.4%), and dural hematomas (1.3%). The patients with 
abnormal MRI were less likely to have their cervical colla r removed than those with normal MRI (13.3% versus 
88.1%). Eleven patients underwent cervical spine surgery af ter the MRI results. The clin ical significance of these 
abnormal MRI findings could not be determined from this study group [55]. By inference, it is likely that some 
obtunded patients with negative cervical spine CT will have abnormal MRI, and some of these MRI-detected 
injuries may require treatment.

A comprehensive literature review of thoracolumbar trau ma was performed by Hsu et al [19] in 2003 with the 
conclusion that patients should undergo im aging of the thoracolumbar spine if  the following criteria were present: 
(1) back pain or midline tenderness, (2) local signs of thoracolumbar injury, (3) abnormal neurological signs, (4) 
cervical spine fracture, (5) Glasgow Coma  Scale score (GCS) <15, (6) major distracting injury, or (7) alcohol or 
drug intoxication. A prospective study by Holmes et al [20] of 152 patients with thoracolumbar spine injury in 2003 found 100% negative predictive value for thoracolumbar spine injury in patients not meeting any of the 
following criteria: (1) complaints of thoracolumbar spine pain, (2) thoracolumb ar spine tenderness, (3) a 
decreased level of consciousness, (4) intoxication with etha nol or drugs, (5) a neurologic deficit, or (6) a painful 
distracting injury. A prospective study of over 3,000 adult blunt trauma patients performed by Inaba et al [21] in 
2015 found 98.9% sensitivity for identifying patients with clin ically significant thoracolumbar spine injury using 
the following criteria: (1) positive physical examination (i ncluding neurologic deficit), (2) high-risk mechanism of 
injury, and (3) ≥60 years of age. It should be noted that in the study by Inaba et al, patients with altered 
consciousness (GCS <15), intoxication, or painful distrac ting injury were excluded from analysis because of their 
inability to perform an adequate examination necessitating imaging clear ance of the thoracolumbar spine. 
However, none of these 3 proposed criteria have  been validated independently (Table 4).

CT Myelography Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
CT myelography can be performed to assess for traumatic spinal canal narrowing that is due to disc herniation or 
epidural hematoma and to assess for preganglionic nerve root avulsions. Ho wever, as with conventional CT, CT 
myelography is inferior to MRI in assessing cord contus ion, cord hemorrhage, and postganglionic nerve root 
injuries [40,41,43,57]. Performance of thoracolumbar CT myelogram can also be technically challenging, 
particularly in patients with suspected  unstable thoracolumbar spine injury. 
CT Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
CT does play a role in the initial assessment of thoracic and lumbar spine injury. However, CT is significantly 
inferior to MRI in identifying many soft-tissue pathologies,  such as cord contusion, epidural hematoma, and nerve 
root avulsions that can cause neurologic deficits re quiring surgical intervention [40,41,43,57]. Therefore, CT 
should not be considered adequate for excluding signifi cant soft-tissue pathology in patients presenting with 
thoracolumbar spine trauma and neurologic deficit. 
MRI Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
MRI should be performed in patients who have possible spinal  cord injury, in whom there is clinical concern for 
cord compression that is due to disc protrusion or hema toma, and in those suspected of ligamentous instability. 
MRI is valuable for characterizing the cause of myelopathy in  patients with spinal cord  injury. The severity of the 
injury—including extent of intramedullary hemorrhage , length of edema, and evidence of cord transection—
contributes to predicting outcome. Compression of the cord  by disc herniation, bone fragments, and hematomas is 
best displayed on MRI, and MRI may be used to guide su rgical interventions [41,43]. For these reasons, the MRI 
examination should include T2-weighted images as well as gradient-echo images. In the subacute and chronic 
stages after cord trauma, MRI can help define the extent of  cord injury. This is particularly important in patients 
who suffer late deterioration, which is sometimes cau sed by treatable etiologies like the development or 
enlargement of intramedullary cavities,  such as a post-traumatic syringomyelia. 
Although numerous research studies ha ve reported a potential value of diffusion MRI for characterizing spinal 
cord injury [111], technical problems have prevented wid espread application of this technique to human studies. 
The current utility of diffusion MRI for assessing cord trauma remains unknown. 
Summary of Recommendations 
 Variant 1: Imaging is not recommended for the initial imaging of patients ≥16 years of age and <65 years of 
age with suspected acute blunt cervi cal spine trauma when imaging is  not indicated by NEXUS or CCR 
clinical criteria and the patient meets low-risk criteria. 
 Variant 2: CT cervical spine without IV contrast is usually  appropriate for the initial imaging of patients ≥16 
years of age with suspected acute blunt trauma of the cervical spine when imaging is indicated by NEXUS or 
CCR clinical criteria. 
 Variant 3: MRI cervical spine without IV contrast is usua lly appropriate as the next imaging study for 
patients ≥16 years of age with suspected acute blunt trauma of the cervical spine and confirmed or suspected 
cervical spinal cord or nerve root injury, with or  without traumatic injury identified on cervical CT. 
 Variant 4: CT cervical spine without IV contrast and MRI cervical spine without IV contrast are usually 
appropriate for patients ≥16 years of age with acute cervical spine injury detected on radiographs and 
treatment planning for mechanically unstable spine.  These procedures are complementary in the assessment 
of unstable spine injuries.

Variant 9: Age greater than or equal to 16 years. Blunt trauma meeting criteria for thoracic and lumbar 
imaging. Initial imaging. 
Imaging is a crucial component in assessment of thoracic and lumbar spine injury. Fr om 1998 to 2011, there was 
an adjusted annual increase of approximately 8% in thor acolumbar spine fractures in patients involved in motor 
vehicle collisions [15]. Thoracolumbar fractures are cha llenging to identify clinically, with only 48% to 75% of 
thoracolumbar injuries identified on clinical examination [16-18]. Unlike cervical injuries, well-defined clinical 
criteria have not been established to determine when thor acolumbar imaging is appropriate in the setting of blunt 
traumatic injury. Since clinical examination has poor sen sitivity for identifying thoracolumbar injuries, any high-
risk patient (mid line thoracolumbar tenderness, high-energ y mechanism of injury, or >60 years of age), as well as 
unexaminable patients (intoxicated, GCS <15, distracting injury), should undergo imaging of the thoracolumbar 
spine. Screening of the entire spine is advised, as an es timated 20% of spine injuries will have a second associated 
spinal injury at a noncontiguous level [26,27]. 
Radiography  Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
It is well established that CT outperforms radiographs in  the diagnosis of thoracolumbar spine fractures [104-
108]. Radiographs have a reported sens itivity of 49% to 62% for identifying thoracic spine fractures and 67% to 
82% sensitivity for identifying lumbar spine fractures [ 104,107,108] compared with the reported sensitivity of 
94% to 100% for identifying thoracolumbar spine fract ures using CT [104,107,108]. However, the clinical 
significance of fractures missed on radiographs is uncertain . If screening of the thoracolumbar spine is performed 
using radiographs, imaging should consis t of anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the thoracic and lumbar 
spine with additional “swimmer’s lateral” view of the upper thoracic spine if this region is obscured by the 
overlying shoulders. 
CT Myelography Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
There is no role for CT myelography in the in itial assessment of thoraco lumbar spine injury. 
CT Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
CT is the gold standard for identifying fractures of the t horacolumbar spine with a reported sensitivity of 94% to 
100% [104,107-110]. In addition to identifying thoracolumbar spine injuri es, CT is excellent for delineating soft-
tissue injuries of the chest, abdomen, and pelvic regi on that often accompany spinal fractures. However, CT 
imaging of the thoracolumbar spine is more commonly pe rformed as part of CT evaluation of the entire thorax, 
abdomen, and pelvis in trauma patients with high index of suspicion for soft-tissue injuries or who cannot be 
cleared by clinical examination. It is debated whethe r dedicated reformatted images using collimated field-of-
views centered on the thoracolumbar spine with dedicated  “hard kernel” image algorithms are more accurate for 
identifying bony pathology. Recent studi es indicate that identification of thoracolumbar spine fractures on routine 
thoracic, abdomen, and pelvic CT imaging using routine body large fields of view and “soft kernel” image 
algorithms is comparable to dedicated thoracolumbar spine reformatted images. Se nsitivity of thoracolumbar 
spine fracture detection using routine body imaging prot ocols has been reported at 94% to 99% compared with 
97% to 99% sensitivity using dedicated thoracolumbar spin e protocols with no statistically significant difference 
in sensitivity between the two protocols [109,110].",True

Explanation: Based on the patient's age, symptoms of low back pain with positive straight leg raise test, and the need to assess for prolapsed intervertebral disc or muscle strain, an MRI lumbar spine with IV contrast may be appropriate. MRI has excellent soft-tissue contrast and can accurately depict lumbar pathology, including disc degeneration and thecal sac and neural structures. However, it is important to note that many MRI abnormalities can be seen in asymptomatic individuals, and imaging in this category is often not beneficial. Therefore, the appropriateness of the scan is categorized as ""may be appropriate"" due to the need for further evaluation and diagnostic uncertainty.

Previous  guidelines  have  suggested  that imaging  be performed  in adults  >50 years of age who present  with LBP. 
When  studied,  there was no statistically  significant  difference in primary  outcome  after 1 year for patients  aged  65 
years or older  who had spine  imaging  within  6 weeks after an initial  visit for care for LBP versus similar  patients  
who did not undergo early  imaging  [9]; thus,  this document  does not include  >50 years of age as an independent  
red flag. However, an important age-related risk factor for spinal fracture presenting as LBP  is osteoporosis.  As 
bone mass decreases slowly over time, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age, and differs by sex, race, 
ethnicity  [10], and comorbidities. In line with the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations for patients  
ages 65 and older being screened for osteoporosis, patients  >65 years of age may be considered at risk for 
osteoporotic fracture when presenting with LBP . 
Additionally,  for those  patients without  neurologic  compromise  and who present  with minor  risk factors for cancer,  
inflammatory  back  disease  (eg, ankylosing spondylitis), vertebral  compression  fracture,  or symptomatic  spinal  
stenosis,  imaging  should be considered  after a trial of therapy  [4]. 
In the majority  of patients, no specific pathology for LBP can be identified. Also,  studies have  shown  imaging  
abnormalities  in a substantial  number  of people  without back  pain [11-13]. The challenge for the clinician, therefore,  
is to distin guish the small  segment  within  this large patient  population that should be evaluated  further because of 
suspicion  of a more  serious  problem  or identify  pathology that requires intervention . 
Other  nonspine  causes of LBP can have overlap  in clinical  presentation,  including inflammatory  arthritis  and other  
systemic conditions , such as pelvic,  renal,  vascular,  or gastrointestinal  etiologies.  If an inflammatory  etiology  is 
suspected  as the cause of LBP, such as ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic  spondylitis, reactive arthritis, or 
inflammatory  bowel  disease– related  spine  disorders,  please see the ACR  Appropriateness Criteria® topic  on 
“Inflammatory Back Pain: Known or Suspected Axial Spondyloarthropathy ” [14]. 
Initial Imaging  Definition 
Initial imaging  is defined  as imaging  at the beginning of the care episode for the medical  condition defined  by the 
variant.

Guideline: ACR low back pain.pdf, Page: 9
Page Content: Surgery  or intervention  
candidate  with  persistent  or progressive symptoms  during  or following  6 weeks of optimal medical  
management.  Initial imaging.  
In the absence of red flags,  first-line treatment  for chronic  LBP remains conservative therapy  with both 
pharmacologic  and nonpharmacologic  (eg, exercise,  remaining  active)  therapy  [19]. However,  patients  presenting  
with subacute or chronic  LBP, with or without  radiculopathy,  who have  failed  6 weeks of conservative therapy  
should be imaged  if they are believed  to be candidates for surgery  or intervention  or if diagnostic  uncertainty  
remains.  The goal of imaging  is to identify  potential  actionable pain generators that could be targeted  for 
intervention  or surgery.  MRI of the lumbar  spine  has become  the initial imaging  modali ty of choice in these patients. 
MRI has excellent  soft-tissue contrast  and accurately  depicts lumbar  pathology,  including disc degeneration , as well 
as the thecal  sac and neural  structures [7]. However,  it is well known that many  MRI abnormalities  can be seen in 
asymptomatic individuals  and that imaging  patients  in this category  is often  not beneficial  [7,11,13,21] . MRI  may

Although the utility  of discography in patients  with LBP remains  controversial,  a systematic review by Manchikanti  
et al [32] provides  level  III evidence that lumbar  discography may be useful  in patients  with chronic  discogenic  
LBP. 
FDG -PET/CT  Whole  Body  
There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of whole -body FDG-PET/CT in the evaluation  of a surgery  or 
intervention  candidate with persistent  or progressive  symptoms  during  or following 6 weeks of conservative  
management  [28-30]. 
MRI Lumbar Spine With IV Contrast  
MRI lumbar  spine  with IV contrast  is not typically  performed  independently as an initial study,  as its interpretation  
is most  informative  when  correlated  with standard  noncontrast  sequences included in MRI lumbar  spine  with and 
without  IV contrast  [33]. 
MRI Lumbar Spine Without and With IV Contrast  
MRI with IV contrast  is typically  not necessary  in the evaluation  of a surgical  or interventional candidate with 
persistent  or progressive  symptoms  during or following  6 weeks of conservative management  but is sometimes  
useful  if noncontrast  MRI is nondiagnostic  or indeterminate.  Contrast  can help distinguish  residual/recurrent  disc 
from  fibrosis/scar  in a postoperative  patient  (see Variant  5). 
MRI Lumbar Spine Without IV Contrast  
Patients  presenting  with subacute or chronic  LBP or radiculopathy  who have  failed  6 weeks of conservative therapy , 
and with physical  examination  signs  of nerve  root irritation , should  be imaged  if they are believed  to be candidates 
for surgery  or intervention  or if diagnostic  uncertainty  remains.  Accurate diagnosis  of disc disease can be provided  
by MRI [7]. 
Although disc abnormalities are common on MRI in asymptomatic  patients,  LBP with radiculopathy or clinical  
signs  of spinal  stenosis suggests the presence of demonstrable  nerve  root compression  on MRI  [13]. In a study of 
symptomatic  patients,  there  was a higher  prevalence  of herniation . Fifty -seven  percent  of patients with LBP  and 
65% of patients  with radiculopathy  had disc herniation  as compared  with the 20% to 28% prevalence reported  in 
the asymptomatic series [7]. Interestingly, the size and type of disc herniation  and location  and presence of nerve  
root compression  were not related  to patient  outcome  [7,34] . 
Kobayashi  et al [35] have  shown  the utility  of MRI in diagnosing active spondylolysis  in radiographically occult  
spondylolysis.  
Radiography Lumbar  Spine  
Although  radiography  alone  is not sufficient  for guidance  on surgical  or interventional  options  without  MRI  and/or  
CT imaging,  it can be seen as compl ementary.  Upright  radiographs  provide  useful  functional  information  about  
axial  loading  [36]. The ability  to incorporate  flexion  and extension  radiographs  is essential  to identify  segmental  
motion,  which  is important in the surgical  management  of spondylolisthesis  [24,37] . Lateral  bending images have  
been  shown  to be helpful  in spinal  deformity  correction  surgery  [25].

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
In the United  States,  acute low back  pain (LBP),  with or without radiculopathy , is the leading  cause of years lived  
with disability  and the third  ranking cause of disability -adjusted  life years  [1]. It is the fifth most  common  reason  
for a physician  visit in the United  States  and accounts for approximately  3% of visits  to the emergency  department  
[2]. 
The American  College  of Physicians and the American  Pain Society  classify  LBP into the following  broad  
categories:  nonspecific LBP, back  pain potentially  associated  with radiculopathy or spinal  stenosis,  and back  pain 
potentially  associated  with another  specific spinal  cause [3]. Additionally,  guidelines  from  the American  College  
of Physicians and the American  Pain Society  [3,4]  emphasize a focused  history  and physical  examination,  
reassurance,  initial pain management  medications if necessary,  and consideration  of physical  therapies without  
routine  imaging  in patients  with nonspecific  LBP. Duration  of symptoms  also helps  guide  treatment  algorithms  in 
patients  with acute,  subacute,  or chronic  LBP. Additionally, assessment  of psychosocial  risk factors when  obtaining  
patient  history  is a strong predictor  of patients  who are predisposed  to developing chronic  disabling LBP problems  
[3]. 
Although there  is great  variability  in the definition  of acute and subacute  LBP, for the purposes  of this guideline,  
we will use the Institute  for Clinical Systems  Improvement  definitions  of 0 to 4 weeks to define  acute LBP,  4 to 12 
weeks for subacute LBP, and >12 weeks for chronic  LBP [5]. 
It is clear  that uncomplicated  acute  LBP and/or  radiculopathy is a benign,  self-limited  condition  that does not 
warrant  any imaging studies [4,6,7] . Imaging is considered  in those  patients who have  had up to 6 weeks of medical  
management  and physical  therapy  that resulted  in little or no improvement  in their back  pain.  It is also considered  
for those  patients  presenting  with red flags , raising  suspicion  for a serious underlying  condition,  such as cauda 
equina  syndrome  (CES),  malignancy,  fracture,  or infection  (see Table 1).

- Diagnosis: None mentioned
- Stage of diagnosis: Initial imaging

2. Analysis of appropriateness based on the given patient profile and context:
Based on the ACR Appropriateness Criteria, initial imaging is typically not warranted for acute low back pain (<4 weeks' duration) without red flags or prior management. Acute uncomplicated low back pain, with or without radiculopathy, is considered a self-limiting condition that is responsive to medical management and physical therapy in most patients. Routine imaging has been shown to provide no clinical benefit in this group. Additionally, nonspecific lumbar disc abnormalities are common in asymptomatic patients, and imaging abnormalities can be seen in a substantial number of people without back pain. Therefore, in the absence of red flags or significant neurological deficits, routine imaging is usually not appropriate for acute low back pain.

3. Recommendation:
Classification: USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE
Explanation: Routine imaging is typically not warranted for acute low back pain without red flags or prior management. Acute uncomplicated low back pain is considered self-limiting and usually responsive to conservative management. Imaging abnormalities can be seen in asymptomatic individuals, and routine imaging has been shown to provide no clinical benefit in this group.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 7 Low Back  Pain • There are complementary  procedures  (ie, more  than one procedure  is ordered  as a set or simultaneously  
where each procedure  provides  unique  clinical  information  to effectively  manage the patient’s  care).  
Discussion  of Procedures  by Variant  
Variant  1: Acute low back pain with  or without  radiculopathy. No red flags.  No prior  management.  Initial 
imaging.  
Imaging is typically  not warranted  in this setting. Acute (<4 weeks’  duration)  uncomplicated  (no red flags)  LBP, 
with or without radiculopathy,  is considered  a self-limiting  condition  that is  responsive to medical  management  and 
physical  therapy  in most  patients  [4,6,7] . Numerous  studies have  shown that routine  imaging  provides  no clinical  
benefit  in this group  [6,9] . Usually  no specific pathology for LBP can be identified. 
Nonspe cific lumbar  disc abnormalities  are common in asymptomatic patients  and can be demonstrated  readily  on 
MRI,  CT, fluoroscopic  myelography,  and postmyelography CT of the lumbar  spine  [11]. Imaging abnormalities  
can be seen in a substantial  number  of people  without back  pain [11-13]. A prospective study by Carragee et al [13] 
found that among patients with lumbar  imaging  abnormalities  before the onset  of LBP, 84% had unchanged or 
improved findings  after symptoms  developed.  A systematic review of 33 articles found an increasing prevalence of 
degenerative spine findings in asymptomatic patients of increasing age  [12]. For example,  disc protrusion  
prevalence increased  from  29% of those 20 years of age to 43% of those  80 years of age in this asymptomatic  
population.  A prospective  cohort  study of 20 patients  showed  no significant differences in MRI changes over 12 
months  in patients  presenting  with acute LBP compared  with their asymptomatic counterparts , except  in disc 
herniation,  nerve  root compression,  and annular  fissure [15]. Even  in the setting  of disc herniation,  imaging  may 
have  limited  role in management  as the majority  of disc herniations  show  some  degree of reabsorption  or regression  
by 8 weeks after symptom onset  [16]. It is important  to note that repeat  imaging  in patients  with new episodes of 
LBP and previous  MRI scans are unlikely  to detect  differences in disc protrusion,  annular  fissures,  high-intensity  
zones,  or end-plate  signal  changes [13]. 
Despite the lack of evidence to support  imaging early  or prior  to conservative treatment  for LBP, there is significant  
variation  in the ordering practices of physicians,  with nonadherance  to guidelines  leading  to increased  health  care 
utilization  [17,18] . A retrospective cohort  study of 145,320  patients ≥66 years of age  with acute nonspecific  LBP, 
revealed  27.2%  received  radiography  and 11.1%  received  CT or MRI within  4 weeks of the initial primary  care 
provider  visit [18]. A prospective  population-based  cohort  study  of 1,770 patients  with acute occupational  LBP 
showed  that 336 (19.0%)  received  lumbar  MRI within  6 weeks of presentation  (nonadherent  to guidelines).  This 
nonadherent  group had an increased  likelihood  of lumbosacral  injections  or surgery  for outpatient, inpatient, and 
nonmedical  services,  and disability  compensation  [17]. Increased  health  care utilization  with early  imaging  has also 
been  demonstrated  in nonworker  populations  [6].

settings  (adapted  from  Bigos et al  [8]). 
Red Flag  Potential  Underlying  Condition  as Cause  of LBP  
• History  of cancer  
• Unexplained  weight  loss 
• Immunosuppression 
• Urinary  infection  
• Intravenous  drug use 
• Prolonged  use of corticosteroids 
• Back  pain not improved with conservative  
management  • Cancer  or infection  
• History  of significant  trauma  
• Minor  fall or heavy  lift in a potentially  osteoporotic  
or elderly  individual  
• Prolonged  use of steroids  • Spinal fracture  
• Acute  onset  of urinary  retention  or overflow  
incontinence  
• Loss of anal sphincter  tone or fecal  incontinence  
• Saddle  anesthesia  
• Bilateral  or progressive  weakness in the lower  
limbs  • Cauda  equina  syndrome  or other  severe neurologic  
condition  
Previous  guidelines  have  suggested  that imaging  be performed  in adults  >50 years of age who present  with LBP. 
When  studied,  there was no statistically  significant  difference in primary  outcome  after 1 year for patients  aged  65 
years or older  who had spine  imaging  within  6 weeks after an initial  visit for care for LBP versus similar  patients  
who did not undergo early  imaging  [9]; thus,  this document  does not include  >50 years of age as an independent  
red flag. However, an important age-related risk factor for spinal fracture presenting as LBP  is osteoporosis.  As 
bone mass decreases slowly over time, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age, and differs by sex, race, 
ethnicity  [10], and comorbidities. In line with the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations for patients  
ages 65 and older being screened for osteoporosis, patients  >65 years of age may be considered at risk for 
osteoporotic fracture when presenting with LBP . 
Additionally,  for those  patients without  neurologic  compromise  and who present  with minor  risk factors for cancer,  
inflammatory  back  disease  (eg, ankylosing spondylitis), vertebral  compression  fracture,  or symptomatic  spinal  
stenosis,  imaging  should be considered  after a trial of therapy  [4]. 
In the majority  of patients, no specific pathology for LBP can be identified. Also,  studies have  shown  imaging  
abnormalities  in a substantial  number  of people  without back  pain [11-13]. The challenge for the clinician, therefore,  
is to distin guish the small  segment  within  this large patient  population that should be evaluated  further because of 
suspicion  of a more  serious  problem  or identify  pathology that requires intervention . 
Other  nonspine  causes of LBP can have overlap  in clinical  presentation,  including inflammatory  arthritis  and other  
systemic conditions , such as pelvic,  renal,  vascular,  or gastrointestinal  etiologies.  If an inflammatory  etiology  is 
suspected  as the cause of LBP, such as ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic  spondylitis, reactive arthritis, or 
inflammatory  bowel  disease– related  spine  disorders,  please see the ACR  Appropriateness Criteria® topic  on 
“Inflammatory Back Pain: Known or Suspected Axial Spondyloarthropathy ” [14]. 
Initial Imaging  Definition 
Initial imaging  is defined  as imaging  at the beginning of the care episode for the medical  condition defined  by the 
variant.

Guideline: ACR low back pain.pdf, Page: 9
Page Content: Surgery  or intervention  
candidate  with  persistent  or progressive symptoms  during  or following  6 weeks of optimal medical  
management.  Initial imaging.  
In the absence of red flags,  first-line treatment  for chronic  LBP remains conservative therapy  with both 
pharmacologic  and nonpharmacologic  (eg, exercise,  remaining  active)  therapy  [19]. However,  patients  presenting  
with subacute or chronic  LBP, with or without  radiculopathy,  who have  failed  6 weeks of conservative therapy  
should be imaged  if they are believed  to be candidates for surgery  or intervention  or if diagnostic  uncertainty  
remains.  The goal of imaging  is to identify  potential  actionable pain generators that could be targeted  for 
intervention  or surgery.  MRI of the lumbar  spine  has become  the initial imaging  modali ty of choice in these patients. 
MRI has excellent  soft-tissue contrast  and accurately  depicts lumbar  pathology,  including disc degeneration , as well 
as the thecal  sac and neural  structures [7]. However,  it is well known that many  MRI abnormalities  can be seen in 
asymptomatic individuals  and that imaging  patients  in this category  is often  not beneficial  [7,11,13,21] . MRI  may 
be helpful  when  there is LBP with radiculopathy  or signs  of spinal  stenosis,  which  suggests the presence of 
demonstrable  nerve  root compression  [13].

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of worsening numbness and tingling in all 4 limbs, uncoordinated movements, difficulty controlling continence, reduced pinprick sensation, and reduced power in all 4 limbs are indicative of myelopathy. Given the patient's history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an inflammatory condition that can result in acute myelopathy, an MRI of the whole spine without and with IV contrast is usually appropriate to evaluate the etiology of the myelopathy.

In cases in which spinal  cord ischemia is suspected  as the cause for acute myelopathy,  MRI without and with IV 
contrast is useful in cases where spinal cord ischemic is suspected as the cause for acute myelopathy  [27,28,45-47] . 
Contrast  enhancement  is typically  not seen in the early  phase of acute ischemia and, if present,  may suggest  an 
alternative  inflammatory  or infectious  etiolog y [48]. Diffusion -weighted  imaging  can show  signal  alteration  in the 
spinal  cord earlier  after patient symptom  onset  compared  with T2-weighted  images  [49,50] . As such,  diffusion-
weighted  imaging  should be included anytime  there is concern  for spinal  cord ischemia [51]. 
When  considering  inflammatory  or infections  etiologies  of myelopathy,  visualization  of the osseous spinal column 
as well as the spinal  cord is useful  and best accomplished  noninvasively by MRI [4,7,45,52 -60]. 
Demyelinating  diseases such as MS and NMO can present  as acute myelopathy.  MS is the classic demyelinating 
disease and is characterized  by lesions affecting  the spinal  cord (and brain)  and clinical  defects disseminated  in 
space and time [61]. Spinal cord involvement  is seen in 80% to 90% of patients  with MS, most  commonly affecting  
the cervical  cord [62]. Patients  with primary  progressive  MS tend to have  more  spinal  cord involvement  than 
patients  with relapsing -remitting  MS [12]. When myelopathy due to MS is suspected,  MRI detection  of spinal  cord 
lesion(s)  fulfills  part of the 2016 Magnetic Resonance Imaging in MS (MAGNIMS ) criteria  [63]. NMO  is a 
demyelinating  condition characterized  by optic  neuritis  and spinal  cord lesions.  Brain  lesions are not as commonly  
encountered  in NMO as in MS, so, when  present , tend to predominate  in regions  around the third  and fourth  
ventricles [64-66]. ADEM  is a demyelinating  condition that typically  manifests as encephalopathy.  Spinal  cord 
involvement  is present  in approximately 25% of cases of ADEM . MRI of the spine  is generally  considered  the 
reference standard  for imaging  of the spinal  cord in cases of suspected  demyelinating  disease [63,67,68]  in addition  
to excluding alternative  etiologies.  Contrast -enhanced  imaging  is recommended  for initial diagnostic  evaluation  
[69,70] . 
MRA Spine 
There is no relevant  literature  regarding the use of MR angiography (MRA ) in the initial imaging  evaluation  of 
acute onset  myelopathy.  In cases of spinal  cord ischemia,  MRA  can be used to identify  the artery  of Adamkiewicz  
or vertebral  artery  dissection/occlusion  and should  be considered  as a follow -up to MRI [12].

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 6 Myelopathy patients  with relapsing -remitting  MS [12]. When myelopathy due to MS is suspected,  MRI detection  of spinal  cord 
lesion(s)  fulfills  part of the 2016  MAGNIMS  criteria  [63]. Other  demyelinating  processes such as NMO and ADEM  
can present  as chronic  myelopathy less commonly.  In patients  with chronic  or progressive myelopathy,  MRI  of the 
spinal  cord can identify  spinal  cord lesions suggestive  of demyelinating  disease in addition  to excluding  alternative  
etiologie s. Contrast -enhanced  imaging  is recommended  for initial diagnostic  evaluation  [69,70] . 
Metabolic  causes of chronic  or progressive  myelopathy result  in changes in the spinal  cord known  as subacute 
combined degeneration  and are best evaluated  with MRI [11,83,84] . Chronic  infections  can have  a similar  
appearance [12].  
Radiation -induced  myelopathy is a rare dose-dependent  complication  that anatomically  localizes to a prior  radiation  
port [85]. Autoimmune  myelitis  includes  paraneoplastic myelopathy [86,87] . MRI  without  and with IV contrast  is 
useful  to evaluate the spinal  cord in these instances.  
Vascular  malformations  can likewise present  with chronic  and slowly  progressive  myelopathy [88]. MRI without  
and with IV contrast  is useful  to demonstrate spinal  cord edema  caused  by venous  hypertension and enlarged  veins  
along the dorsal  surface of the spinal  cord.  There may be patchy  intramedullary  enhancement  due to breakdown  of 
the blood-cord  barrier.  In some  cases,  abnormal  vasculature may be identified  that may be useful  to guide  spinal  
arteriography  and intervention [5,89-91] . 
Primary  and metastatic  tumors  of the spinal  cord very rarely  cause  myelopathy and are best evaluated  on contrast -
enhanced  MRI of the spine  [92-96]. The distinction  of syrinx from  tumor,  location  of small  tumor  nodules,  extent  
of cyst, and distinction  of nodule  and cyst from  edema  are crucial  in treatment  planning for intramedullary  disease  
and best delineated  with MRI [9,97] . 
In cases in which MRI shows findings  suspicious  for arachnoid  cyst/arachnoid  web or ventral  cord herniation,  CT 
myelography can be performed  for further evaluation  [79,80] . Likewise,  in cases  in which there is clinical concern  
for positional myelopathy,  MRI with flexion/extension  can be performed  as a follow -up [78]. 
MRA Spine 
There is no relevant  literature  regarding the use of MRA  in the initial imaging  evaluation  of chronic  or progressive  
myelopathy.  If MRI demonstrates findings  concerning for an underlying vascular  malformations,  MRA  can be 
performed  as a follow -up to demonstrate abnormal  vasculature that may be useful  to guide  spinal  arteriography and 
intervention  [5,89-91] . 
CT Myelography Spine 
CT myelography may be useful  in this setting  to answer  specific questions  before  surgical  intervention [72,73] . In 
cases in which MRI shows  findings  suspicious  for arachnoid  cyst/arachnoid  web or ventral  cord herniation, CT 
myelography can be performed  for further evaluation  [79,80] . Likewise,  in cases  in which there is clinical concern  
for positional  myelopathy,  extension/flexion positional CT myelography can be performed  as a follow -up [98]. In 
spondylotic  myelopathy,  conventional  myelography  can be used to diagnose  severe canal  stenosis [74].

patients  to developing spinal  cord ischemia include  systemic hypotension,  thoracoabdominal  aneurysms or 
dissection , sickle cell disease,  and spinal  arteriovenous  malformations  (AVM s) [27,28] . Very  rarely,  patients  may 
develop hematomyelia and subsequently acute myelopathy because of an intrameduallary  AVM  or spinal  artery  
aneurysm  rupture  [29,30] . Acute ischemic myelopathy can also develop in the setting  of fibrocartilaginous  embolic  
disease [31]. Depending on the level(s)  of the spinal  cord involved,  patients  will typically  develop acute paraparesis 
or quadriparesis.  Inflammatory  conditions  that can result  in acute myelopathy include  demyelinating  diseases such 
as multiple  sclerosis (MS),  neuromyelitis  optica  (NMO),  and acute disseminated  encephalomyelitis (ADEM) ; 
systemic inflammatory  conditions  such as systemic lupus  erythematous,  Sjogren  syndrome,  mixed  connective  tissue

The imaging  changes in the spinal  cord due to myelomalacia and gliosis  are best discerned  by MRI [81,82] . 
Intramedullary  cord signal  changes on MRI in patients with spondylotic  myelopathy represent  prognostic  factors  
for neurosurgical  outcome  [21,37-41] . IV contrast  is typically  not required  for the diagnosis  of spondylotic  
myel opathy,  but characteristic patterns of enhancement  can be seen immediately  at and below  a level  of stenosis  
[42,43] . 
In patients  who have  undergone  spinal  surgery,  late complications  (eg, adjacent  level  degenerative  disease with 
spinal  stenosis,  recurrent  disc herniation)  can result  in extrinsic  compression  of the spinal  cord and are best evaluated  
using MRI without  and with IV contrast  [44].

2. Analysis of appropriateness based on the given patient profile and context:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with lower back pain for the past 2 months, radicular pain of the left lower limb, and no fever. There is no specific diagnosis mentioned, but the scan ordered is an MRI lumbar spine without and with IV contrast for possible spondylodiscitis.

According to the ACR Appropriateness Criteria, MRI of the lumbar spine without IV contrast is typically the initial imaging modality of choice for patients presenting with subacute or chronic lower back pain or radiculopathy who have failed 6 weeks of conservative therapy. It is also recommended if there is diagnostic uncertainty or if the patient is believed to be a candidate for surgery or intervention. MRI can accurately diagnose disc disease and assess soft-tissue pathology.

However, the appropriateness of adding IV contrast for possible spondylodiscitis is unclear based on the given information. The patient does not have any signs of infection mentioned, such as fever or history of recent infection. Therefore, there is insufficient information to determine the appropriateness of the scan ordered.

In the absence of red flags,  first-line treatment  for chronic  LBP remains conservative therapy  with both 
pharmacologic  and nonpharmacologic  (eg, exercise,  remaining  active)  therapy  [19]. However,  patients  presenting  
with subacute or chronic  LBP, with or without  radiculopathy,  who have  failed  6 weeks of conservative therapy  
should be imaged  if they are believed  to be candidates for surgery  or intervention  or if diagnostic  uncertainty

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
In the United  States,  acute low back  pain (LBP),  with or without radiculopathy , is the leading  cause of years lived  
with disability  and the third  ranking cause of disability -adjusted  life years  [1]. It is the fifth most  common  reason  
for a physician  visit in the United  States  and accounts for approximately  3% of visits  to the emergency  department  
[2]. 
The American  College  of Physicians and the American  Pain Society  classify  LBP into the following  broad  
categories:  nonspecific LBP, back  pain potentially  associated  with radiculopathy or spinal  stenosis,  and back  pain 
potentially  associated  with another  specific spinal  cause [3]. Additionally,  guidelines  from  the American  College  
of Physicians and the American  Pain Society  [3,4]  emphasize a focused  history  and physical  examination,  
reassurance,  initial pain management  medications if necessary,  and consideration  of physical  therapies without  
routine  imaging  in patients  with nonspecific  LBP. Duration  of symptoms  also helps  guide  treatment  algorithms  in 
patients  with acute,  subacute,  or chronic  LBP. Additionally, assessment  of psychosocial  risk factors when  obtaining  
patient  history  is a strong predictor  of patients  who are predisposed  to developing chronic  disabling LBP problems  
[3]. 
Although there  is great  variability  in the definition  of acute and subacute  LBP, for the purposes  of this guideline,  
we will use the Institute  for Clinical Systems  Improvement  definitions  of 0 to 4 weeks to define  acute LBP,  4 to 12 
weeks for subacute LBP, and >12 weeks for chronic  LBP [5]. 
It is clear  that uncomplicated  acute  LBP and/or  radiculopathy is a benign,  self-limited  condition  that does not 
warrant  any imaging studies [4,6,7] . Imaging is considered  in those  patients who have  had up to 6 weeks of medical  
management  and physical  therapy  that resulted  in little or no improvement  in their back  pain.  It is also considered  
for those  patients  presenting  with red flags , raising  suspicion  for a serious underlying  condition,  such as cauda 
equina  syndrome  (CES),  malignancy,  fracture,  or infection  (see Table 1).

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 6 Low Back  Pain Table  1. Red Flags : Indications  of a more  complicated  status  include  back  pain/radiculopathy  in the following  
settings  (adapted  from  Bigos et al  [8]). 
Red Flag  Potential  Underlying  Condition  as Cause  of LBP  
• History  of cancer  
• Unexplained  weight  loss 
• Immunosuppression 
• Urinary  infection  
• Intravenous  drug use 
• Prolonged  use of corticosteroids 
• Back  pain not improved with conservative  
management  • Cancer  or infection  
• History  of significant  trauma  
• Minor  fall or heavy  lift in a potentially  osteoporotic  
or elderly  individual  
• Prolonged  use of steroids  • Spinal fracture  
• Acute  onset  of urinary  retention  or overflow  
incontinence  
• Loss of anal sphincter  tone or fecal  incontinence  
• Saddle  anesthesia  
• Bilateral  or progressive  weakness in the lower  
limbs  • Cauda  equina  syndrome  or other  severe neurologic  
condition  
Previous  guidelines  have  suggested  that imaging  be performed  in adults  >50 years of age who present  with LBP. 
When  studied,  there was no statistically  significant  difference in primary  outcome  after 1 year for patients  aged  65 
years or older  who had spine  imaging  within  6 weeks after an initial  visit for care for LBP versus similar  patients  
who did not undergo early  imaging  [9]; thus,  this document  does not include  >50 years of age as an independent  
red flag. However, an important age-related risk factor for spinal fracture presenting as LBP  is osteoporosis.  As 
bone mass decreases slowly over time, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age, and differs by sex, race, 
ethnicity  [10], and comorbidities. In line with the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations for patients  
ages 65 and older being screened for osteoporosis, patients  >65 years of age may be considered at risk for 
osteoporotic fracture when presenting with LBP . 
Additionally,  for those  patients without  neurologic  compromise  and who present  with minor  risk factors for cancer,  
inflammatory  back  disease  (eg, ankylosing spondylitis), vertebral  compression  fracture,  or symptomatic  spinal  
stenosis,  imaging  should be considered  after a trial of therapy  [4]. 
In the majority  of patients, no specific pathology for LBP can be identified. Also,  studies have  shown  imaging  
abnormalities  in a substantial  number  of people  without back  pain [11-13]. The challenge for the clinician, therefore,  
is to distin guish the small  segment  within  this large patient  population that should be evaluated  further because of 
suspicion  of a more  serious  problem  or identify  pathology that requires intervention . 
Other  nonspine  causes of LBP can have overlap  in clinical  presentation,  including inflammatory  arthritis  and other  
systemic conditions , such as pelvic,  renal,  vascular,  or gastrointestinal  etiologies.  If an inflammatory  etiology  is 
suspected  as the cause of LBP, such as ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic  spondylitis, reactive arthritis, or 
inflammatory  bowel  disease– related  spine  disorders,  please see the ACR  Appropriateness Criteria® topic  on 
“Inflammatory Back Pain: Known or Suspected Axial Spondyloarthropathy ” [14]. 
Initial Imaging  Definition 
Initial imaging  is defined  as imaging  at the beginning of the care episode for the medical  condition defined  by the 
variant.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 11 Low Back  Pain Discography  and Post-Discography  CT Lumbar  Spine  
Although the utility  of discography in patients  with LBP remains  controversial,  a systematic review by Manchikanti  
et al [32] provides  level  III evidence that lumbar  discography may be useful  in patients  with chronic  discogenic  
LBP. 
FDG -PET/CT  Whole  Body  
There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of whole -body FDG-PET/CT in the evaluation  of a surgery  or 
intervention  candidate with persistent  or progressive  symptoms  during  or following 6 weeks of conservative  
management  [28-30]. 
MRI Lumbar Spine With IV Contrast  
MRI lumbar  spine  with IV contrast  is not typically  performed  independently as an initial study,  as its interpretation  
is most  informative  when  correlated  with standard  noncontrast  sequences included in MRI lumbar  spine  with and 
without  IV contrast  [33]. 
MRI Lumbar Spine Without and With IV Contrast  
MRI with IV contrast  is typically  not necessary  in the evaluation  of a surgical  or interventional candidate with 
persistent  or progressive  symptoms  during or following  6 weeks of conservative management  but is sometimes  
useful  if noncontrast  MRI is nondiagnostic  or indeterminate.  Contrast  can help distinguish  residual/recurrent  disc 
from  fibrosis/scar  in a postoperative  patient  (see Variant  5). 
MRI Lumbar Spine Without IV Contrast  
Patients  presenting  with subacute or chronic  LBP or radiculopathy  who have  failed  6 weeks of conservative therapy , 
and with physical  examination  signs  of nerve  root irritation , should  be imaged  if they are believed  to be candidates 
for surgery  or intervention  or if diagnostic  uncertainty  remains.  Accurate diagnosis  of disc disease can be provided  
by MRI [7]. 
Although disc abnormalities are common on MRI in asymptomatic  patients,  LBP with radiculopathy or clinical  
signs  of spinal  stenosis suggests the presence of demonstrable  nerve  root compression  on MRI  [13]. In a study of 
symptomatic  patients,  there  was a higher  prevalence  of herniation . Fifty -seven  percent  of patients with LBP  and 
65% of patients  with radiculopathy  had disc herniation  as compared  with the 20% to 28% prevalence reported  in 
the asymptomatic series [7]. Interestingly, the size and type of disc herniation  and location  and presence of nerve  
root compression  were not related  to patient  outcome  [7,34] . 
Kobayashi  et al [35] have  shown  the utility  of MRI in diagnosing active spondylolysis  in radiographically occult  
spondylolysis.  
Radiography Lumbar  Spine  
Although  radiography  alone  is not sufficient  for guidance  on surgical  or interventional  options  without  MRI  and/or  
CT imaging,  it can be seen as compl ementary.  Upright  radiographs  provide  useful  functional  information  about  
axial  loading  [36]. The ability  to incorporate  flexion  and extension  radiographs  is essential  to identify  segmental  
motion,  which  is important in the surgical  management  of spondylolisthesis  [24,37] . Lateral  bending images have  
been  shown  to be helpful  in spinal  deformity  correction  surgery  [25].

MRI is the most sensitive test for detecting soft abnormalities associated with neck pain, but it is characterized by a high rate of abnormalities in asymptomatic individuals. In this patient's case, there is no indication of radiculopathy or night pain, and the clinical exam does not reveal any focal neurological deficit. Therefore, an MRI without IV contrast is usually not appropriate for the initial examination.

insufficient medical literature to conclude whether or not these patients would benefit from this procedure. 
The use of MRI cervical spine without IV contrast in this patient population is controversial but may be  
appropriate.

Myelography Cervical Spine  
Myelography is not an appropriate test for chronic neck pain in the absence of radicular or myelopathic 
symptoms.  Similar to more recent literature on MRI, asymptomatic degenerative changes have been described on 
myelograms  [116].

MRI Cervical Spine  
Metal artifact may limit assessment of the cervical hardware and complications related to position or integrity. 
There continues to be emerging techniques for metal artifact reduction, which is beyond the scope of this 
document [54]. MRI is the most sensitive imaging test for detecting soft -tissue abnormalities associated with neck 
pain but is characterized by a high rate of abnormalities in asymptomatic individuals [22, 23]. Most cervical 
discectomies are performed by an anterior approach  without transgression of the epidural space ; therefore , 
epidural scar  or granulation tissue formation is minimal,  and contrast -enhanced imaging is not routine ly used after 
ACDF  [55].  Gadolinium -enhanced MRI may have a role in the setting of neck pain and prior posterior -approa ch 
cervical fusion/ decompressive procedures, although the majority of the literature to date evaluates the use of 
gadolinium -based contrast in the differentiation of recurrent disc herniations  (a potentially actionable finding) 
from epidural scar in the setting of lumbar spine surgery  [56,57]. 
Bone Scan Whole Body with SPECT or SPECT/CT Neck  
There is no current role for nuclear medicine studies as the initial examination in this scenario. The role of Tc -
99m bone scan in the setting of new or worsening neck pain in the postsurgical patient is limited, as radionuclide 
scans may remain positive f or a year or more in the region of the operative bed [58]. SPECT/CT may offer 
diagnostic information in the setting of suspected pseudoarthrosis or equivocal CT or MRI findings [59 ]. 
Radiography Cervical Spine  
Initial radiographic  evaluation , including anteroposterior  and lateral  views,  is useful to  assess hardware integrity  
and detect adjacent  segment  disease,  which  may contribut e to symptoms  [60,61]. The addition  of 
flexion/extension  radiographs  may be considered  to improve  detection  of vertebral  body nonunion or 
pseudoarthrosis  [62] and may supplement  conventional  views following  ACDF  [63],  cervical  disc implantation , 
or posterior  cervical  fixation  [64-66 ]. 
Myelography Cervical Spine  
CT myelog raphy has supplanted fluoroscopic myelography in most circumstances; however, there may be times 
when fluoroscopic myelography is also performed prior to CT imaging. The ultimate judgment regarding the 
appropriateness of any specific procedure, lumbar v ersus  cervical puncture route, amount of contrast , and the 
extent and modality of imaging coverage must be made by the radiologist, with appropriate documentation and coding [17].

history  of immunosuppression,  immunocompromised,  diabetes,  long-term  steroid  use, renal  or liver failure,  or

Variant 5:  Ulnar -sided chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or nonspecific . Next study.  
MRI Wrist  
Both traumatic and degenerative lesions of the TFCC can produce chronic, ulnar -sided wrist pain . MRI is highly 
accurate for lesions involving the radial (central) zone of the disc, especially with the use of high -resolution fast 
spin-echo or 3-D grad ient-recalled pulse sequences [36]. There is some evidence suggesting that MRI performed 
with a 3.0 T system is even more accurate than MRI performed with a 1.5 T system for TFCC lesions [37], but 
there are no studies comparing the accuracy of the two field s trengths in the same patients. The sensitivity for 
tears of the ulnar attachment of the disc and the peripheral attachments (the ulnocarpal ligaments) are only fair 
with noncontrast -enhanced wrist MRI [ 12,36]. IV contrast seldom provides added benefit in patients with ulnar -
sided wrist pain but may increase sensitivity for TFCC lesions if MR arthrography is desired but direct joint 
injection is not feasible. 
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
Direct MR arthrography (performed with contrast injection of the radiocarpal or distal radioulnar compartments, 
alone or in combination) does result in better diagnostic accuracy for the T FCC compared with conventional MRI, 
especially for ulnar -sided lesions [26, 38], even when compared to conventio nal MRI performed with a 3.0 T 
magnet [7,8,39]. The same is true for intrinsic ligament injuries, such as those of the lunotriquetral ligament, 
which can produce ulnar -sided pain [7 ,8,39]. Performing either MR arthrography or noncontrast -enhanced MRI is 
usually appropriate in this scenario.  
CT Arthrography  Wrist  
The accuracy of CT arthrography is superior to MRI  and similar to that  of MR arthrography for TFCC and 
intrinsic ligament lesions [8,40]. In addition, CT arthrography appears to be mor e accurate than either MRI or  MR 
arthrography for identifying articular cartilage defects in the wrist [38]. In contrast to MRI and MR arthrography, 
CT arthrography is less sensitive to lesions occurring outside of the joint (like abnormalities of the extensor carpi 
ulnaris tendon) that can result in ulnar -sided pain.  For these reasons, CT arthrography may be appropriate in this 
setting , especially if there is a contraindication to MRI or if artifact from metallic implants produce too much 
artifact on MRI.  
Arthrography  Wrist  
Conventional (x-ray) arthrography—performed with contrast injection into one  or more  wrist compartments—has 
moderate accuracy for the diagnosis of TFCC perforations [7 ].

Once a scaphoid fracture is identified, Radiographic arthrography does not contribute to the evaluation for 
complications of the fracture.  
Variant 12: Chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or nonspecific. Suspect carpal tunnel syndrome.  Next 
study. 
US Wrist 
Several meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the 
carpal  tunnel  inlet) is highly accurate for identifying carpal  tunnel syndrome  diagnosed clinically or with the 
combination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US 
varies depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the 
measurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary 
examination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel 
syndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal 
tunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, 
clinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of 
carpal tunnel syndrome. US may be appropriate in cases where this initial evaluation is equivocal.  
MRI Wrist  
Historically, carpal tunnel syndrome has been diagnosed based on clinical signs and sympt oms and confirmed by 
the results of electrodiagnostic studies [67]. MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in cases in which this  
initial evaluation is equivocal. The MRI findings that have been reported in wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome —
including nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing—may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value 
in patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68]. In rare cases of secondary carpal tunnel syndrome, MRI may identify 
a mass lesion compressing the median nerve. There is some evidence that the length of T2 hyperintensity in the 
median nerve can help prognosticate the success of surgery [69] and that the shape and signal of the nerve predict 
clinical response to a steroid injection in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome [70 ]. MR neurography 
may be an option in patients with suspected carpal tunnel syndrome.  The use o f IV contrast does not contribute to 
diagnosis and is usually not appropriate.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
MR arthrography is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.  
CT Wrist  
CT, with or without IV  contrast, is not routinely used to diagnose carpa l tunnel syndrome.  
CT Arthrography  Wrist  
CT arthrography is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.  
Bone Scan  Wrist  
Bone scan is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.  
Arthrography  Wrist  
Radiographic arthrography  is not routinely us ed to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome . 
Summary of Recommendations  
• Wrist radiographs are indicated as the best initial imaging examination in patients with chronic wrist pain. 
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal and a patient has persistent symptoms wi th an unclear diagnosis, 
MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate.  
• In patients with suspected inflammatory arthritis, MRI either with or without IV contrast is usually 
appropriate if guidance for management or prognostication is needed.  
• Patients with  suspected wrist infection should undergo aspiration.  
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal in a patient with ulnar -sided pain, either MRI without IV contrast 
or an MR arthrogram of the wrist is usually appropriate.  
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal in a patient with radial -sided pain, MRI without IV contrast is 
usually appropriate.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 10 Chronic Wrist Pain  importantly, though, the finding of enhancing bone marrow “edema” (osteitis) on MRI studies in patients with 
early RA is proving to be the best single predictor of future disease progression and functional dete rioration, even 
compared to serologies and clinical measures [27, 28,32-34].  
US Wrist  
The diagnosis of a specific inflammatory arthritis is typically established based on clinical and laboratory 
analysis. Advanced imaging is usually performed to determine disease activity, guide management decisions, and prognosticate outcomes. In patients with RA, US  of the wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints can  show 
inflammation  as active synovitis. Identifying active synovitis with power Doppler assessment is a useful adjunct 
in making an early diagnosis of RA when a pati ent with early arthritis does not meet the 2010 criteria established 
by the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism [20]. The presence of 
synovitis predicts progression of erosions [31 ] and erosions themselves [35]. US can also depict small bone 
erosions with high spatial resolution; h owever, US is less sensitive to erosions that occur on the radial or ulnar 
sides of the inner carpal bones because direct scanning of these regions is blocked, unlike the dorsal and volar 
bone surfaces. Furthermore, unlike MRI, US cannot show changes within the bone marrow, which are  the 
strongest prognosticator s for disease progression in RA [27, 28,32-34].  In patients with established inflammatory 
arthritis who are undergoing therapy, judging progression or reduction of synovitis may be more difficult with 
sequential US compared to sequential MRI.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
MR arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected inflammatory 
arthritides. 
CT Wrist  
While CT is more sensitive than radiographs for erosions, CT is not routinely used for the diagnosis and 
management of patients with suspected inflammatory arthritides . 
CT Arthrography  Wrist  
CT arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected inflammatory 
arthritides. 
Bone Scan  Wrist  
Bone scan does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients  with suspected inflammatory 
arthritides. 
Arthrography  Wrist  
Radiographic arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected 
inflammatory arthritides. 
Variant 4: Chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or show nonspecific ar thritis. Exclude infection. Next 
study. 
Aspiration  Wrist  
No literature directly addresses the appropriateness of imaging studies beyond radiographs in patients with 
suspected infection in the wrist. However, generalizing from experience with septic arthrit is in other joints, joint 
aspiration should not be delayed in order to obtain advanced imaging studies. In cases of suspected septic arthritis, 
percutaneous aspiration of the wrist is indicated, even when radiographs appear normal. Aspirates should be 
analyzed by cell count, gram stain, and appropriate cultures. Microscopic crystal analysis should also be obtained 
if there is a possibility of gout, acute pseudogout, or hydroxyapatite deposition disease. Aspiration can be 
performed without imaging guidance i f the joint is distended, but either fluoroscopy or US  may be useful if a 
specific compartment is to be targeted.  
MRI Wrist  
There may be a role for MRI with IV contrast enhancement in the staging of infections (for example, to delineate the location and extent of soft-tissue abscesses)  after aspiration has been performed.  Especially in chronic cases, 
MRI with IV contrast may be useful to identify a fluid collection or joint effusion to target  for aspiration.  
However, MRI is usually not appropriate as the next study after radiographs for suspected wrist infections.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
MR arthrography is not routinely used to evaluate suspected wrist infection.

MRI allows the visualization of bone marrow edema patterns, which improve s the detection of fractures in cases of 
negative or inconclusive radiographs [70] . The utility of MRI in the detection of radiographically occult Chopart 
fractures has been demonstrated by Almeida et al [64] . Baker et al [71]  analyzed 31 occult fractures involving the 
ankle and foot in h ockey players,  finding five occult fractures in the foot, all of which involved the navicular bone. 
Pierre -Jerome et al [72] found 79% of cuboid fractures in the diabetic population that were radiographically occult 
using MRI. MRI is also useful in the detection of occult fractures involving the fifth metatarsal bone (Jones fracture) 
and the subtalar join t [65,73] . There is no evidence in the literature supporting the routine use of contrast in the 
diagnosi s of occult fractures.  
MRI has replaced bone scans in the evaluation of symptomatic accessory ossicles. MRI allows optimal visualization 
of the bone marrow within the ossicle and visualization of the synchondrosis. Accessory ossicles may also be 
associated  with tendon pathology, which is also well assessed on MRI [74]. MRI allows clear demonstration of the 
findings often associated with posterior ankle impingement syndrome [75]. Contrast administration is not routinely 
performed when assessing symptomatic accessory ossicles on MRI; however, contrast within a disrupted 
synchondrosis may be demonstrated on MR arthrography stu dies [69]. 
US Foot   
Although not routinely performed, previous studies have demonstrated the role of US in the detection of occult foot 
fractures. On US, these can be seen as cortical irregularities and are frequently associated with soft -tissue injury in 
the acute or subacute setting. Wang et al [76]  demonstrated 24 cases of radiographically occult ankle and foot 
fractures in 268 patients. Of these, foot fractures were found most frequently in the calcaneus and metatarsals, and 
less frequently in the navicular, cuboid , and cuneiform bones.  
On US, several findings have been reported in cases of painful accessory ossicles, including patients with posterior 
ankle impingement syndrome ; however , optimal characterization of the synchondrosis is difficult on US [62] . High -
resolution US offers some advantages over other imagin g modalities because it allows dynamic exploration of the 
foot with further assessment of stability of the synchondrosis and tendon tears when present as well as direct clinical 
correlation and comparative evaluation with the asymptomatic foot [77] . Power Doppler US has proven useful in 
identifying increased blood supply in the setting of ankle impingement [78,79] .

MRI Foot  
Compression of the infe rior calcaneal nerve or Baxter’s neuropathy manifests as denervation changes of the 
abductor digiti minimi muscle. Because of  its ability to demonstrate signal intensity changes in the presence of 
muscle denervation, MRI has been sho wn to be useful in the dia gnosis of patients with Baxter’s neuropathy and in 
the exclusion of other causes of foot pain [23] . However, fatty atrophy of the abductor digiti minimi muscle is not 
a specific sign of Baxter’s neuropathy and can be found in 4% of asymptomatic subjects [80]. Contrast 
administration is not routinely performed in the initial assessment of neuropathic syndromes.

Compression of the infe rior calcaneal nerve or Baxter’s neuropathy due to calcaneal enthesophytes, plantar fasciitis,

Because of  poor spatial  resolution,  low specificity,  and the inability  to quantify  the size of the necrotic lesion , bone  
scintigraphy is not beneficial  for characterization  of osteonecrosis.  SPECT may improve  the accuracy  of bone  
scintigraphy [30,32,33]  for detection  of osteonecrosis,  but its use has not been  widely  accepted . In addition,  few 
studies suggest  that bone  scan may be used to screen  for multifocal osteonecrosis [34,35] .

CT is less sensitive  than bone  scintigraphy  and MRI  for the detection  of early  osteonecrosis [36]. Once an 
insufficiency  fracture  occurs,  CT is superior  to MRI in showing  location  and extent  of articular  collapse [37,38] . 
CT also shows osseous details  of secondary  osteoarthritis  well. 
MRI Area  of Interest  Without  and With  IV Contrast  
MRI with dynamic  contrast  enhancement  has been  shown  to be useful  to differentiate  osteonecrosis from  transient  
bone  marrow  edema  syndrome  and subchondral  insufficiency  fracture  [39]. Transient  bone  marrow  edema show s 
subchondral  spot of marked  hyperperfusion (plasma flow) , whereas osteonecrosis  shows a rim of high plasma flow 
surrounding a subchondral  area without  flow [40]. This rim is thought  to represent  granulation  tissue.  Higher  slope  
of enhancement  and maximum enhancement  in epiphysis  was seen in transient  bone  marrow  edema than in 
subchondral  fracture.  Osteonecrosis showed  overall  decreased  maximal  enhancement  [41].

2. Explanation: According to the ACR Appropriateness Criteria, MRI knee without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study after radiographs did not show fracture, for the evaluation of suspected occult knee fractures or internal derangement after a fall or acute twisting trauma to the knee in skeletally mature children. Since the patient is 8 years old and has a trauma to the left knee, an MRI without IV contrast is an appropriate imaging recommendation.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 8 Acute  Trauma  to the Knee  Variant  3: Adult  or skeletally  mature  child.  Fall or acute twisting  trauma  to the knee.  No fracture  seen on 
radiographs.  Suspect  occult  fracture or internal derangement.  Next  study. 
CT Knee  
CT may be performed  as the next imaging  study  for the evaluation  of suspected  radiographically occult  knee  
fractures.  
Several  studies reported  CT to be superior  to knee  radiographs  in detection  and classification  of fractures.  In a study 
by Mustonen  et al [12],  CT showed  100%  and radiographs  83% sensitivity  in detection  of tibial plateau fractures , 
and CT was superior  in further  characterization  of fracture  severity . 
In the setting  of acute knee  trauma,  Mui et al [13] reported  80% sensitivity  and 98% specificity  of the CT 
examination  in detecting  bony  avulsion  fractures and a high negative  predictive  value  for excluding  ligamentous  
injuries , but MRI remained  necessary  for the preoperative  detection  of meniscal  injury . 
Peltola  et al [14] compared  dual-energy  CT examinations  with MRI  studies as a reference standard  in 18 patients  
with acute knee  trauma  and reported  dual-energy  CT had 79% sensitivity  and 100%  specificity  in detecting  anterior  
cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures  [14]. 
In a study  by Heffernan  et al [15], 64-channel  multidetector  CT showed  87.5% to 100%  sensitivity  and 100%  
specificity  for detection  of the ACL  tears.  As on MRI,  secondary  signs,  such as buckling  of the posterior  cruciate 
ligament , were also useful  in their diagnosis.  In this study , multidetector  CT showed a low sensitivity  for other  soft-
tissue injuries  at the knee;  however,  its high specificity  indicated  that apparent  posterior  cruciate  ligament , meniscal,  
and collateral  ligament  tears can reliably  be treated  as true-positive  findings  [15]. 
The dual-energy  CT virtual  noncalcium  technique  can subtract  calcium  from  cancellous bone,  allowing  detection  
[16-18] and possibly grading of the post-traumatic  bone  marrow  contusions  [18]. 
However,  MRI is superior  to CT in detection  of bone  marrow  abnormalities  and meniscal  and ligamentous  injuries  
and may be subsequently  performed  as clinically  indicated. 
MR Arth rography  Knee  
With  negative radiographs,  MR arthrography  is not routinely  used as the next imaging study  for the evaluation  of 
suspected  occult  knee  fractures or internal  derangement . 
MRA Knee  
With  negative radiographs,  MRA  is not routinely  used as the next imaging study  for the evaluation  of suspected  
occult  knee  fractures or internal  derangement . 
MRI Knee  
MRI has many  distinct advantages for the evaluation  of the injured  knee  in the setting  of negative  radiographs.  
The majority  of patients  (93.5%)  who present  with acute  knee  injuries  in the emergency  department  sustained  soft-
tissue injuries  rather  than osseous injuries  [19].  MRI  is a proven valuable  tool in the treatment  decision -making  
process,  allowing  earlier  surgical  intervention  by obtaining  a more  accurate diagnosis  [20,21] . Frobell et al [22] 
reported  a low diagnostic  benefit  of the initial clinical  examination  in the setting  of acute knee  trauma  with higher -
than-suspected  incidence of the ACL  injuries  on MRI.

US Area  of Interest  With  IV Contrast  
Although prospective studies have  emerged  suggesting  that US is accurate  in the discrimination  of benign from  
malignant  soft tissue masses,  the number  of malignancies in these studies was limited  [16,28] . Therefore,  the use 
of US for the final evaluation  and staging  of a deep  soft tissue mass  is not recommended.  
Variant  4: Soft tissue mass.  Nondiagnostic  radiograph and noncontrast -enhanced  ultrasound.  MRI  
contraindicated. Next  imaging  study.  
The body regions covered in this clinical scenario include the neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, humerus/upper arm, 
shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist, hand, hip, femur/thigh, knee, tibia/lower leg, ankle, and foot.  
CT Area  of Interest  With  IV Contrast  
CT has become a useful  technique  for the evaluation  of patients  who cannot  undergo MRI and is the modality  of 
choice in this scenario  [29]. In the evaluation  of suspected  tumors,  contrast  imaging  is especially  useful  in 
distinguishing vascularized  from  potentially  necrotic regions  of the tumor.  With  modern  CT technology,  
calcification  can usually  be distinguished from  vascular  enhancement.  
Of note, d ual-energy  CT is a relatively  newer  technology that has shown  utility  in evaluation  of soft tissue masses.  
Using  the differences in energy  attenuation  of soft tissue at 80 kVp and 140 kVp,  this technique  can allow  
reconstruction  of virtual noncontrast  CT images as well as significantly  reduce metal  artifact  in the assessment  of 
metal  implants,  improving the diagnostic  value  of imaging  in the surrounding soft tissues [49,50] . It has also shown  
application  in the assessment  of marrow  edema [51,52]  and has been  investigated  in the distinction  of marrow  
edema from  intramedullary  tumor  invasion [53]. Furthermore,  spectral  CT is emerging  as a useful  tool for 
distinguishing benign from  malignant  soft tissue masses [54]. 
CT Area  of Interest  Without and With  IV Contrast  
Dual-phase CT without  and with IV contrast  as the next imaging  study for the evaluation  of a soft tissue mass  may 
be appropriate when MRI is con traindicated . Although single -phase CT with IV contrast is considered most 
appropriate in this clinical scenario given the advent of virtual noncontrast reconstruction with modern dual -source 
CT scanners [31] , a traditional CT without and with  IV contrast can be helpful  for characterization of mineralization 
in an anatomically complex area.  
CT Area  of Interest  Without IV Contrast  
The l iterature  does not support  the use of a single -phase CT without  IV contrast  as the next imaging  study  for the 
evaluation  of a soft tissue mass  when  MRI is contraindicated.  However,  single -phase CT with IV contrast  is a useful  
technique  for the evaluation  of patients  who cannot  undergo  MRI and is the modality  of choice  in this scenario  [29]. 
In the evaluation  of suspected  tumors,  contrast  imaging  is especially  useful  in distinguishing  vascularized  from  
potentially  necrotic regions  of the tumor.  With  modern CT techno logy,  calcification  can usually  be distinguished  
from  vascular  enhancement.  Therefore,  CT without  IV contrast  is usually  not beneficial .

MRI  of the primary  tumor  resection  site has further  asserted  its usefulness  for surveillance  of local  recurrence  with 
improvements  in metal  artifact  reduction.  Given  the preference  for limb-sparing  surgeries,  many  bone  tumor  
resections  require  the implantation  of hardware  which  creates  local  artifact  that can obscure  the adjacent  tissues.  
Few studies  comparing  the use of MRI  for local  recurrence  of bone  tumors  compared  with other  modalities  have  
been  published  in recent  years  likely  given  its widespread  adoption  clinically.  MRI  is often  requested  before  surgery

evaluation  of a soft tissue  mass.  Although a multi-institutional study of 133 patients  with primary  soft tissue 
malignancies by Panicek  et al [32] found no statistically  significant  difference between  MRI and contrast -enhanced  
CT imaging  in determining  tumor  involvement  of muscle,  bone,  joint, or neurovascular  structures,  this study  did 
not endorse the usefulness  of single -phase  CT without  IV contrast.  
MRI Area  of Interest  Without  and With  IV Contrast  
MRI without  and with IV contrast  is the technique  of choice as the next imaging  study for the evaluation  of soft 
tissue masses.  Its improved  soft tissue contrast  and multiplanar  capability  have  provided significant  advantages for 
lesion  conspicuity,  intrinsic  tumor  characterization,  and local  staging  [3,11] . Vascular  structures and neurovascular  
involvement  are more  easily  defined  when  compared  with CT.

The diagnostic  accuracy  of US is considerably  less when  lesions outside  the subcutaneous tissue are included.  It is 
also less reliable  for defining deep  masses in large anatomical  areas [27]. Although an assessment  of diagnostic  
accuracy  of US with IV contrast  in the setting  of a deep  soft tissue  mass  is not available in the current  literature,  
there is presumably  no added  benefit  over standard  grayscale and Doppler  US. Therefore,  the US with IV contrast  
is not useful  for the initial assessment  of deep  soft tissue masses.

performing  a single  study with or without IV contrast.  
CT Lumbar Spine Without IV Contrast  
CT lumbar  spine  without  IV contrast  can be helpful  in assessing  osseous fusion.  CT can detect  potentially  painful  
hardware failure , including  prosthetic  loosening,  malalignment, or metallic  fracture [44]. Additionally, CT lumbar  
spine  without  IV contrast  is equal  to MRI  for predicting  significant  spinal  stenosis  and excluding  cauda equina  
impingement  [27]. 
CT Myelography Lumbar  Spine  
CT myelography of the lumbar  spine  can be useful  in assessing  the patency  of the spinal  canal/thecal  sac and of the 
subarticular  recesses and neural  foramen  [22]. It has safety  advantages over MRI  for patients  who have  implanted  
medical  devices that are not MRI safe or conditional  and can be useful  in patients  with significant  artifact  from  
metallic  surgical  hardware on MRI [23]. CT myelography is occasionally  more  accurate in diagnosing nerve  root 
compression  in the lateral  recess [48,49] , but it has the disadvantage  of requiring  lumbar  puncture  for intrathecal

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 16 Chronic Shoulder Pain  MRI Shoulder  Without  and With  IV Contrast  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of MRI  shoulder  without  and with IV contrast  in the evaluation  of 
chronic  shoulder  pain with a history  of prior  rotator  cuff repair  when  a rotator  cuff disorder  or subacromial  
subdeltoid bursitis  is suspected.  
MRI Shoulder  Without  IV Contrast  
MRI is useful  in the evaluation  of the postoperative  rotator  cuff. The shift from  metallic  to bioabsorbable  suture  
anchors  tends  to result  in fewer  cases  with metal  artifact  implications  [153] . For patients  with meta llic suture  
anchors,  there are a variety  of commercially  available metal  artifact  reduction sequences,  which  can limit artifact.  
MRI can demonstrate  complications  with suture  anchors  such as osteolys is or migration  [154] , even  if the suture  
anchors  are nonmetallic . MRI can also demonstrate potential improvements  in muscle  atrophy and fatty infiltration  
after rotator  cuff repair  [155,156] .  
Radiography Shoulder  Additional Views  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of additional  radiographic  views in the evaluation  of chronic  
shoulder  pain with a history  of prior  rotator  cuff repair  when  rotator  cuff disorder  or subacromial  subdeltoid bursitis  
is suspected.  
US Shoulder  
An advantage  of US evaluation  of the postoperative  shoulder  is the absence  of metal -induced artifact  when  
examining the rotator  cuff and adjacent  soft tissues.  Patients  who have  undergone  rotator  cuff repair  may show  
discrete defects on US imaging  that may persist  for years with some  potential for delayed  healing  [157] . Despite  
these limitations, US still provides  an excellent  method  to assess repair  integrity, with a high sensitivity  (80.8%)  
and specificity  (100%)  for recurrent  rotator  cuff tear [158] . The ability  to perform  provocative  maneuvers can 
further demonstrate abnormalities  that other  forms  of imaging  would be incapable  identifying.  
Summary  of Recommendations 
• Variant 1 : Radiography is usually appropriate for the initial imaging of chronic shoulder pain.  
• Variant 2 : US or MR arthrography or MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study 
in the evaluation of chronic shoulder pain when  radiographs are normal or inconclusive and rotator cuff 
disorders or subacromial subdeltoid bursitis (no prior surgery)  is suspected . These procedures are equivalent 
alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage 
the patient’s care).  
• Variant 3 : Image -guided anesthetic +/ - corticosteroid injection  is usually appropriate as the next imaging study 
in the evaluation of chronic shoulder pain when radiographs demonstrate calcific tendinopathy or calcific bursitis. 
• Variant 4 : MR arthrography or MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study in the 
evaluation of chronic shoulder pain when radiographs are normal or inconclusive and labral pathology or shoulder instability is suspected.  These procedures a re equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be 
ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 5 : Image -guided anesthetic +/ - corticosteroid injection or MRI without IV contrast is usually 
appropri ate as the next imaging study in the evaluation of chronic shoulder pain when radiographs are normal 
or inconclusive and adhesive capsulitis is suspected.  These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one 
procedure will be ordered to provide the c linical information to effectively manage the patient’s care). Although 
the panel did not agree on recommending US because there is insufficient medical literature to conclude whether these patients would benefit from the procedure, its use may be appropri ate.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 11 Shoulder Pain –Traumatic  Variant 5: Traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs show Bankart  or Hill-Sachs lesion. Next imaging  study. 
Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions are common findings associated with transient shoulder dislocation. Bankart 
lesions have a particularly high association with transient shoulder dislocations [50], and a transient shoulder 
dislocation should be presumed if a Bankart lesion is present. A close association exists bet ween Bankart and 
Hill-Sachs lesions [ 51], and one should be sought out whenever the other is identified on radiographs. Both 
Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions can present as nonosseous  lesions that are occult on r adiographs and noncontrast 
CT. 
MRI Shoulder  
Similar to MR arthrography, noncontrast MRI is comparable to CT in evaluating glenoid and humeral head bone 
loss [12,18]. In general, noncontrast MRI performs well in diagnosing labroligamentous injuries [ 20,52]. 
However, noncontrast MRI is considered inferior to MR arthrography for assessing labroligamentous pathology 
frequently associated with Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions [ 17,19]. Noncontrast MRI is a good alternative to MR 
arthrography in the setting of acute injury when significant glenohumeral joint effusion is present to assist in 
visualization of intra -articular soft -tissue pathology.  
MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography is the preferred study for evaluating subacute or chronic Bankart lesions because of  its soft -
tissue contrast. Multiple studies have shown MR arthrography to be reliable in diagnosing labroligamentous 
injuries [12,17,52] and superior to noncontrast MRI for this indication [ 17,19]. MR arthrography has been shown 
to be equivalent to CT in the assess ment of glenoid and humeral head bone loss [ 12,18], while being superior to 
CT in assessment of labroligamentous in juries [12]. MR arthrography is also able to delineate humeral head and 
glenoid cartilage, which can be important because some Hill -Sachs lesions affect  cartilage only  [11]. 
CT Shoulder  
Noncontrast CT has historically been used to assess Hill -Sachs and bony Bankart lesions. However, MRI has 
been shown to be equivalent to CT for a ssessing both glenoid and humeral head bone loss [ 12,18,53], and CT is 
limited in the assessment of cartilaginous Hill -Sachs lesions [11]. In addition, CT cannot assess injury to 
soft-tissue structures like the labroligamentous complex, which further limits its usefulness in evaluating Bankart 
lesions. CT should be reserved for patients with a contraindication to MRI or patients in whom MRI assessment 
of bone loss is limited.  
CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
CT arthrography has sho wn fair agreement between observers and is comparable to MR arthrography in 
diagnosing Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions [ 12,13]. However, CT arthrography is inferior to MRI in diagnosing 
other soft -tissue pathology [ 12]. CT arthrography can be considered a reasonable imaging alterna tive in patients 
with contraindication to MRI. 
US Shoulder  
There is no role for US  in assessment of Bankart or Hill -Sachs lesions. US  has been demonstrated to be inferior to 
MRI in diagnosing both labroligamentous injury and Hill -Sachs lesions [ 17]. 
FDG -PET/CT  Skull Base to Mid-Thigh 
There is no role for FDG-PET/CT  in assessment of  Bankart or Hill -Sachs lesions.

MR arthrography is the preferred exam ination  for the evaluation of subacute shoulder dislocations or recurrent 
shoulder instability. MRI has been shown to have similar performance to CT in the evaluation of Hill-Sachs 
lesions and glenoid bone loss [12,18]. MR arthrography has also been found to be reliable in diagnosi ng anterior 
shoulder instability and labroligamentous injuries [58,59]. MR arthrography has specifically o utperformed 
noncontrast MRI in assessment of glenohumeral ligament and anterior labral injuries [ 17,19], which ar e 
commonly seen in shoulder instability. MR arthrogr aphy has also outperformed noncontrast MRI in diagnosis of 
rotator cuff tears [17,19], which is a common associated finding in older patients with shoulder dislocation. 
However, high sensitivities reported for MR arthrography in the detection of labral pathology may not be 
applicable to patients with clinically unstable shoulders. A retrospective review of 90 patients with clinically 
unstable shoulders selected for arthroscopy [ 60] found that MR arthrography had a sensitivity of 65% for 
detection of labral  tears. The authors proposed that this discrepancy with prior studies was the result of different 
patient selection criteria (clinically unstable in their study versus less-specific symptoms such as shoulder pain in 
others) and the interpretation of MR art hrography by experienced musculoskeletal radiologists [ 60]. For this 
document, it is assumed the procedure is performed and interpreted by an expert.  
MRI Shoulder  
MRI without contrast may be pre ferred to MR arthrography in the setting of acute shoulder dislocation when a 
post-traumatic joint effusion is present to provide sufficient visualization of soft -tissue structures. In the subacute 
or chronic setting, the glenohumeral joint effusion is usually too small to provide adequate joint distention for 
optimal assessment  of soft -tissue structures. Non contrast MRI has been shown to be inferior to MR arthrography 
in diagnosing labroligamentous and rotator cuff injuries [17,19]. Non contrast MRI performs comparably to CT in 
evaluating glenoid and humeral head bone loss [ 12,18], which may obviate the need for noncontrast CT . 
CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
CT arthrography is effective in evaluation of shoulder instability. CT arthrogr aphy is comparable to MR 
arthrography in the diagnosis of Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions [12] , and moderate agreement has been found 
between readers for diagnosing ant erior capsule laxity on CT arthrography. However, CT arthrography has been 
shown to be inferior to MR arthrography in assessing partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [12], which makes CT 
arthrography less desirable in older patients with dislocation/instability where rotator cuff tears are common. CT 
arthrography may be considered in a patient with shoulder dislocation/instabili ty and contraindication to MRI.  
CT Shoulder  
Noncontrast CT has historically been performed to assess bone loss in patients with recurrent dislocation or 
chronic instability. However, recent studies have shown MRI to be equivalent to CT in assessment of glenoid and 
humeral head bone loss [12,18], which places in question the need for noncontrast CT in the assessment of 
shoulder instability. Noncontrast CT is als o unable to assess rotator cuff and labroligamentous pathology 
commonly seen in shoulder dislocations/instability. In general, CT should be reserved for patients with a 
contraindication to MRI or patients in whom MRI assessment of bone loss is limited.

Explanation: MRI arthrography is the preferred examination for the evaluation of subacute shoulder dislocations or recurrent shoulder instability. It has been shown to have similar performance to CT in the evaluation of Hill-Sachs lesions and glenoid bone loss. MRI arthrography is reliable in diagnosing anterior shoulder instability, labroligamentous injuries, and rotator cuff tears. It outperforms noncontrast MRI in the assessment of glenohumeral ligament and anterior labral injuries, which are commonly seen in shoulder instability.

Shoulder dislocation or instability is most co mmon in the anterior direction. Younger patients are more likely to 
have labroligamentous injury and persistent instability after dislocation compared with older patients [54]. Older 
patients are more likely to have rotator cuff tears in association with shoulder dislocation [ 55]. Coexisting 
humeral avulsion of the glenohumeral ligament and significant glenoid bone loss have been found in up to 10% of 
patients with recurrent shoulder instability [ 56], which underscores the need to assess both osseous and 
labroligamentous pathology in patients with shoulder dislocation or instability. Glenoid morphology and bone 
loss can play a significant factor in recurrent shoulder dislocations [15, 16,57], which may require bone grafting in 
order to restore stability [ 57].

comparable [38]. 
The accuracy of MRI for extrinsic ligament assessment is unknown [ 37]. 
Extensor carpi ulnaris tendinopathy, tenosynovitis, and tendon rupture can be evaluated with MRI or US [43]. 
However, dynamic instability may be missed on MRI, unless sequences are performed in pronation and 
supination [44]. 
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
At 1.5T, MR arthrography has greater sensitivity compared with conventional MRI [ 45,46]. Both MRI and MR 
arthrography have poor to moderate sensitivity for partial ligament tears [ 47,48]. When only complete tears are 
considered, MRI and MR arthrography may be equivalent [ 33]. 
The accuracy of  MR arthrography for extrinsic ligament assessment is unknown [ 37]. 
US Wrist  
High -frequency US is useful for visualizing wrist tendons as well as intrinsic and extrinsic carpal ligaments 
[44,49,50]. Dynamic “clenched fist” maneuvers may be performed to improve detection of low -grade injuries 
[51]. 
For tears of the dorsal band of the scapholunate ligament, US  sensitivity varies from 46 % to 100% and specificity 
from 92 % to 100% [50-52 ]. For the dorsal band of the lunotriquetral ligament, US  sensitivity ranges from 25 % to 
50% and specificity from 90% to 100% [52,53]. US visualization of lunotriquetral ligament (particularly the 
structurally important volar band) is limited [ 49]. 
US can show dynamic subluxation of the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon during forced supination [ 44].

imaging of both wrists in maximal pronation, neutral position, and maximal supination.  
CT examin ation with coronal, sagittal, and 3 -D reformed images help demonstrate the extent of injury and help in

Distal radioulnar joint instability and traumatic triangular f ibrocartilage injuries can be evaluated with CT

MRI is ideal for evaluating tendon injuries and helping with surgical planning [58, 59]. MRI is comm only used for 
the diagnosis of  Stener lesions of the thumb [60] and the diagnosis of pulley system injuries [61]. 
Hergan et al [62] reported a 100% sensitivity and specificity for assessment of thumb ulnar collateral ligament 
tears. Spaeth et al [ 63] reported a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 94% for detection of displaced ulnar 
collateral ligament tears in 16 cadaveric specimens.  
US Hand  
A Stener lesion occurs when the aponeurosis of the adductor pollicis muscle becomes interposed between the 
ruptured ulnar collateral ligament of the thumb and its site  of insertion at the base of the proximal phalanx. This 
lesion can be identified by absence of ulnar collateral ligament and the presence of a hypoechoic mass proximal to 
the apex of the metacarpal tubercle [64]. Dynamic examination shows the relationship of the aponeurosis to the 
retracted ligament stump [65] . 
US allows for diagnosis of pulley system injuries [ 66,67]. 
Bone Scan Hand 
Bone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  
Variant 6: Initial radiographs showing metaca rpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, or distal 
interphalangeal joint malalignment in the absence of fracture. Next imaging study.  
CT Hand  
CT has limited use for the diagnosis of soft -tissue injuries of the fingers.  
MRI Hand  
MRI is ideal for evaluating tendon injuries and helping with surgical planning [58]. MRI may be used to assess 
capsule and collateral ligament injuries of the proximal interphalangeal  and metacarpophalangeal joints [68]. 
For flexor tendon injuries, Rubin et al [ 69] reported a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of  100% in cadavers.  
Drapé et al  [58] reported sensitivity and specificity of 100% for diagnosis of tendon re -tears after flexor tend on 
repair and a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 100% for diagnosis of peritendinous adhesions in 63 injured 
fingers.  Jersey finger refers to avulsion injury of flexor digitorum profundus from  insertion at base of distal 
phalanx. In patients with jers ey finger, MRI is commonly used to evaluate the level of tendon retraction, the 
quality of the tendon stump, and the associated injuries including pulley injuries [16]. In clinically equivocal 
cases, MRI may demonstrate injury to the central slip or the extensor hood [ 16]. 
MRI allows for the assessment of pulley system lesions [ 66,67]. MRI can accurately depict the pulley system, 
particularly the A2 and A4 pulleys, with lower sensitivity for A3 and A5 pulleys [ 70]. Hauger et al  [70] reported 
direct identification of A2  and A4 pulleys in 12 of 12 cases (100%) and direct diagnosis of an abnormal A2 pulley 
in 100% and A4 pulley in 91% of 33 cases.  
For volar plat e injuries, MRI may be used to diagnose tears that do not involve the underlying bone [71]. This is 
important  because untreated lesions can result in contractures or joint laxity [ 72]. 
MRI of the extensor system has not been as well studied as that of the flexor system.  Drapé et al [73] reported a 
sensitivity of 89 % to 92% for evaluation of normal sagittal bands of the extensor hood.  For the detection of 
extensor hood injuries, MRI sensitivity ranges from 28% to 85% [ 74]. 
MRI is especially useful for detection of ulnar collateral ligament and radial collateral ligament injuries.  
Pfirrmann et al [74] reported a sensitivity of 67% and a specificity of 91% for collateral ligament injuries of the 
lesser metacarpophalangeal joints. With MR arthrography, sensitivity and specificity increased to 75% and 98%, 
respectively [74].

MRI is the preferred  imaging method for evaluating  suspected  “turf  toe” and lesser  metatarsal  plantar  plate  injury  
by directly  evaluating  the soft-tissue structures of the capsuloligamentous  complex  as well as assessing  chondral  
and osteochondral  lesions [29,55,56] . 
Acute  Tendinous  Rupture  
MRI tends  to be used as a screening  tool when  one is not certain  of the specific tendon injury  or if concomitant  
osseous injury  is suspected.  Both  MRI and US have  been  shown  to be sensitive  for the diagnosis  of acute tendon  
rupture  or dislocation  in the foot [39]. In a surgically  confirmed  study,  MRI was shown  to have  83% sensitivity  
for diagnosing tendon and ligament  traumatic  injuries  about  the foot and ankle  [37]. 
US Foot  
The importance  of focused  US examinations  is emphasized  in the literature  [57,58] . Protocol -based  US evaluation  
identified  97.4%  of symptomatic abnormalities  in the distal  extremities  (including the foot),  with additional  
accuracy  obtained  with focused  examination  [57]. 
Lisfranc  Injury  
Although  the literature  evidence is limited, US may hold promise  as an alternative method to accurately  evaluate 
for a significant  Lisfranc injury  providing direct  and indirect  assessment  of the Lisfranc ligamentous  complex  as 
well as dynamic  evaluation  with weightbearing  as demonstrated  in a series of 10 patients  [59].  Dorsal  component  
of Lisfranc ligament  is amenable to direct  US evaluation  [59,60] , although this structure may not be critical  for 
stability  for the Lisfranc joint [20,32] . The physiologic  deformation of the dorsal  Lisfranc ligament  resulting  from  
functional  loading emphasized  the need  for normative  US data as well as proper  positioning  when  bilateral  
evaluation  is performed  [61,62] . 
Turf Toe and Plantar  Plate Injuries 
US in the sagittal  plane  best visualizes  the plantar  plate  between  the flexor  tendon and hyaline  cartilage of the 
metatarsal  head  [63]. US has shown  a 96% sensitivity  compared  with 87% sensitivity  for MRI  for the detection  of 
lesser  toe plantar  plate  tears;  however , both modalities  have  poor specificity  [64].  
Acute  Tendinous  Rupture  
Both  MRI and US have  been  shown  to be sensitive for the diagnosis  of acute tendon  rupture  or dislocation  in the 
foot [39].

Page Content: • Variant 3 : MRI without IV contrast or MRI without and with IV contrast is usually appropriat e as additional 
imaging following radiographs  of the foot , in diabetic patients with or without neuropathic arthropathy when 
foot swelling and ulceration is present and osteomyelitis is suspected.  These procedures are equivalent 
alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage 
the patient’s care) . The panel did not agree on recommending a Tc -99m 3-phase bone scan foot  in this clinical 
scenario . There is insufficient medical literature to conclude  whether or not a Tc-99m 3- phase bone scan 
would be of benefit . A Tc -99m 3-phase bone scan in this patient population is controversial but may be 
appropriate.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 8 Chronic Foot Pain  MRI Foot  
MRI allows the visualization of bone marrow edema patterns, which improve s the detection of fractures in cases of 
negative or inconclusive radiographs [70] . The utility of MRI in the detection of radiographically occult Chopart 
fractures has been demonstrated by Almeida et al [64] . Baker et al [71]  analyzed 31 occult fractures involving the 
ankle and foot in h ockey players,  finding five occult fractures in the foot, all of which involved the navicular bone. 
Pierre -Jerome et al [72] found 79% of cuboid fractures in the diabetic population that were radiographically occult 
using MRI. MRI is also useful in the detection of occult fractures involving the fifth metatarsal bone (Jones fracture) 
and the subtalar join t [65,73] . There is no evidence in the literature supporting the routine use of contrast in the 
diagnosi s of occult fractures.  
MRI has replaced bone scans in the evaluation of symptomatic accessory ossicles. MRI allows optimal visualization 
of the bone marrow within the ossicle and visualization of the synchondrosis. Accessory ossicles may also be 
associated  with tendon pathology, which is also well assessed on MRI [74]. MRI allows clear demonstration of the 
findings often associated with posterior ankle impingement syndrome [75]. Contrast administration is not routinely 
performed when assessing symptomatic accessory ossicles on MRI; however, contrast within a disrupted 
synchondrosis may be demonstrated on MR arthrography stu dies [69]. 
US Foot   
Although not routinely performed, previous studies have demonstrated the role of US in the detection of occult foot 
fractures. On US, these can be seen as cortical irregularities and are frequently associated with soft -tissue injury in 
the acute or subacute setting. Wang et al [76]  demonstrated 24 cases of radiographically occult ankle and foot 
fractures in 268 patients. Of these, foot fractures were found most frequently in the calcaneus and metatarsals, and 
less frequently in the navicular, cuboid , and cuneiform bones.  
On US, several findings have been reported in cases of painful accessory ossicles, including patients with posterior 
ankle impingement syndrome ; however , optimal characterization of the synchondrosis is difficult on US [62] . High -
resolution US offers some advantages over other imagin g modalities because it allows dynamic exploration of the 
foot with further assessment of stability of the synchondrosis and tendon tears when present as well as direct clinical 
correlation and comparative evaluation with the asymptomatic foot [77] . Power Doppler US has proven useful in 
identifying increased blood supply in the setting of ankle impingement [78,79] . 
Variant 6: Chronic foot pain. Entrapment s yndromes. Radiographs negative or equivocal. Clinical concern 
includes Baxter’s neuropathy. Next imaging study.  
Bone Scan Foot with SPECT/CT  
There is no relevant  literature supporting the use of nuclear medicine studies in the diagnosis of Baxter’s neuropathy.  
CT Foot  
There is no relevant literature supporting the use of CT , either with or without contrast in the diagnosis of Baxter’s  
neuropathy.  
MRI Foot  
Compression of the infe rior calcaneal nerve or Baxter’s neuropathy manifests as denervation changes of the 
abductor digiti minimi muscle. Because of  its ability to demonstrate signal intensity changes in the presence of 
muscle denervation, MRI has been sho wn to be useful in the dia gnosis of patients with Baxter’s neuropathy and in 
the exclusion of other causes of foot pain [23] . However, fatty atrophy of the abductor digiti minimi muscle is not 
a specific sign of Baxter’s neuropathy and can be found in 4% of asymptomatic subjects [80]. Contrast 
administration is not routinely performed in the initial assessment of neuropathic syndromes.  
US Foot  
Compression of the infe rior calcaneal nerve or Baxter’s neuropathy due to calcaneal enthesophytes, plantar fasciitis,  
or varices can result in heel pain.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 4 Chronic Foot Pain  Discussion of Procedures by Variant  
Variant 1: Chronic foot pain. Unknown etiology. Initial imaging.  
Bone Scan Foot  
There is no relevant literature  to support t he use of nuclear medicine studies as the first imaging  study  in the 
evaluation of chronic foot pain.  
CT Foot  
There is no relevant literature to support the use of CT as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot 
pain.  
MRI Foot  
There is no r elevant literature  to support the use of MRI as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot 
pain.  
Radiography Foot  
Conventional radiography can be useful to distinguish among different causes of chronic foot pain and is usually 
the first imag ing study in evaluating patients with chronic foot pain.  
The value of radiographs in the diagnosis of tarsal coalitions has been extensively demonstrated. Overall 
sensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs 
in the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral 
and oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar 
coalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs 
on the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have 
been found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable 
methods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  
Radiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review 
by Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for 
radiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.  
Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  
usually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, 
osteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite 
versus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess 
with radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton’s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other 
causes of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg’s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals 
or soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . 
Though radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in 
patients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The 
combination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a 
specificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15]. 
US Foot  
Ultrasound (US) is usually not indicate d as the first imaging  study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain, but may 
be performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of pathologic conditions of the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, 
and other conditions such as tarsal tunnel syndrome, Morton’s  neuroma , plantar plate tears,  and intermetatarsal 
bursitis. 
Variant 2: Persistent posttraumatic foot pain. Radiographs negative or equivocal. Clinical concern includes 
complex regional pain syndrome type I. Next imaging study.  
3-Phase Bone Scan Foot  
A 3-phase bone scan may be useful in cases of suspected complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type I reflex 
sympathetic dystrophy , and several imaging findings have been described.",True
