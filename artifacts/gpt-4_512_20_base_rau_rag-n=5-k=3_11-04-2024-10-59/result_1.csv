these limitations, US still provides  an excellent  method  to assess repair  integrity, with a high sensitivity  (80.8%)  
and specificity  (100%)  for recurrent  rotator  cuff tear [158] . The ability  to perform  provocative  maneuvers can 
further demonstrate abnormalities  that other  forms  of imaging  would be incapable  identifying.  
Summary  of Recommendations 
• Variant 1 : Radiography is usually appropriate for the initial imaging of chronic shoulder pain.  
• Variant 2 : US or MR arthrography or MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study 
in the evaluation of chronic shoulder pain when  radiographs are normal or inconclusive and rotator cuff 
disorders or subacromial subdeltoid bursitis (no prior surgery)  is suspected . These procedures are equivalent 
alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage 
the patient’s care).  
• Variant 3 : Image -guided anesthetic +/ - corticosteroid injection  is usually appropriate as the next imaging study 
in the evaluation of chronic shoulder pain when radiographs demonstrate calcific tendinopathy or calcific bursitis. 
• Variant 4 : MR arthrography or MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study in the 
evaluation of chronic shoulder pain when radiographs are normal or inconclusive and labral pathology or shoulder instability is suspected.  These procedures a re equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be 
ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 5 : Image -guided anesthetic +/ - corticosteroid injection or MRI without IV contrast is usually 
appropri ate as the next imaging study in the evaluation of chronic shoulder pain when radiographs are normal

Appropriately positioned  radiographs can exclude shoulder dislocation and most displaced fractures as the 
etiology for post -traumatic shoulder pain. In the setting of normal shoulder radiographs, the most common causes 
of post -traumatic shoulder pain are soft -tissue injuries such  as rotator cuff and labral tears.  
MRI Shoulder  
Noncontrast MRI is a reasonable imaging study in the setting of acute nonlocalized traumatic shoulder pain and 
noncontributory radiographs. In the acute trauma setting, noncontrast MRI may be preferred to MR arthrography , 
as acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint effusion for assessment of intra -articular 
soft-tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic 
pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [34,35]. MRI is also sensitive for diagnosing bone marrow 
contusion and has  been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries in pediatric patients [ 36,37]. 
MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography has been found to be superior to noncontrast MRI in the diagnosis of labroligamentous and 
partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [17,19]. In the acute trauma setting, however, noncontrast MRI may be 
preferred to MR arthrography because acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint

of the sacroiliac joints  and spine  in axSpA  [9,107-111,125 -129] . The Spondyloarthritis  Research  Consortium  of

Radiography Sacroiliac  Joints   
There is no standard  method of following  patients  with radiographs  to evaluate for progression of structural  changes  
[22], and the American  College  of Rheumatology recommends against  routine  radiographic  follow -up given  the 
lack of proven benefit  [30]. Repeat  radiographs  can be obtained as necessary  for counseling  patients  on the status  
and prognosis  of their disease,  although radiographs  are more  typically  performed  to evaluate the spine  rather  than 
the sacroiliac  joints  [30]. This is because of  the low utility  of sacroiliac joint radiographs  for detecting  disease  
progression based  on the relatively  poor intra- and interreader  reliability  of interpretation  [141] . Radiographs  can 
demonstrate evolving  structural  changes or bone  formation,  although these changes occur  slowly  over time at the 
sacroiliac joints, often  requiring  years to detect  a change and prompting many  authors  to suggest  a radiographic  
imaging  interval  of axSpA  patients  of no less than 2 years for assessment  of disease progression [141- 146]. There 
is evidence that patients  on TNF -inhibitors  may have  slower  progression of structural  damage at the sacroiliac joints

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 6 Acute Hand and Wrist Trauma  Like CT, MRI shows intra -articular extension of distal radius fractures more frequently than radiography.  Unlike 
CT, MRI shows concomitant ligament  injuries, including tears of the scapholunate ligament, which may affect 
surgical treatment [26,27]. Despite these advantages,  MRI performed immediately at the time of injury has little 
added value for determining which patients go on to surgery [ 23]. 
MRI is especially useful in evaluating  hand soft -tissues injuries, including the collateral ligaments, volar plates, 
tendons, and pulleys. For metacarpal and digital fractures, MRI is usually not indicated during acute injury [ 22]. 
There is no evidence to support the use of MRI with IV contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist trauma.  
US Area of Interest  
US may have a limited utility  for evaluating bone injuries. Christiansen et al  [28] reported 47% sensitivity and 
61% specificity of US  for the detection of scaphoid fractures . They concluded that US  is not suitable for the early 
diagnosis of scaphoid fracture.  In contrast, Hauger et al  [29] reported that using cortical disruption as a diagnostic 
criterion on US is an accurate sign for detecting occult fractures of the scaphoid waist. Further study of US  for the 
diagnosis of occult fractures is needed . 
Bone Scan Area of  Interest  
Bone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  
Variant 3: Acute wrist fracture on radiographs. Suspect wrist tendon or ligament trauma. Next imaging 
study. 
Radiography Wrist  
Assessment of carpal instability with conventional radiographs requires careful attention to radiographic 
positioning.  In low -grade injuries, radiographs are usually normal.  Scapholunate diastasis of >4 mm and dorsal til t 
of the lunate of > 10° suggests dorsal intercalated segmental instability  [30,31].

MRI is ideal for evaluating tendon injuries and helping with surgical planning [58, 59]. MRI is comm only used for 
the diagnosis of  Stener lesions of the thumb [60] and the diagnosis of pulley system injuries [61]. 
Hergan et al [62] reported a 100% sensitivity and specificity for assessment of thumb ulnar collateral ligament 
tears. Spaeth et al [ 63] reported a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 94% for detection of displaced ulnar

US Hand  
A Stener lesion occurs when the aponeurosis of the adductor pollicis muscle becomes interposed between the 
ruptured ulnar collateral ligament of the thumb and its site  of insertion at the base of the proximal phalanx. This 
lesion can be identified by absence of ulnar collateral ligament and the presence of a hypoechoic mass proximal to 
the apex of the metacarpal tubercle [64]. Dynamic examination shows the relationship of the aponeurosis to the 
retracted ligament stump [65] .

One study eva luating anterior talofibular ligament injury demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy of 97% for MRI 
when compared to arthroscopic findings. Additionally, MRI identified the exact location of the injury in 93% of 
the cases [15].  Comparing MRI with arthroscopy, studies have shown a range of accuracies of chronic lateral 
ligament tearing (either partial or complete), ranging from 77 % to 92% for the anterior talofibular ligament and 
88% to 92% for the calcaneofibular ligament [14, 52]. For the evaluation of deep deltoid ligament tears, MRI is 
both sensitive and specific compared with arthroscopy, with reported values of 96% and 98%, respectively [53].  
With regard to tears of the tibiofibular ligaments of the tibiofibular syndesmosis, MRI has a reported accuracy of 100% [54]. Additionally, MRI can also demonstrate interosseous membrane tears [55]. MRI offers the advantage 
of evaluating for injuries associated with or mimicking lateral instability that may not be diagnosed on stress radiography such as tenosynovitis, tendon injury, and osteochondral lesions [56]. MRI may also be used to evaluate the ankle after lateral ligament reconstruction [57].

CT with IV contrast is not ind icated in this scenario because soft-tissue abnormalities and fluid collections can be 
identified on noncontr ast high -resolution CT studies. 
MRI Ankle  
MRI of the ankle without IV contrast is most sensitive for evaluation of occult fractures with associated bone 
marrow edema patterns, particularly in inversion injuries and persistent lateral ankle pain, as well  as presence and 
extent of soft -tissue injuries  [29]. Stress injuries of bone , including those of the weekend warrior , are best depicted 
by MRI  [50]. 
MRI is the reference standard for ligamentous injury and assessment of stability , which is particularly important in 
athletes, in whom determination of grade ( 1, 2, or 3) of syndesmotic ligament, anterior tibiofibular ligament , and 
deltoid injuries is critical for treatment planning and return to sport assessment [51]. High -resolution evaluation of 
the tendons and ligaments allows distinction between tendinopathy, sprain, and partial or complete tears.  
Ligament and tendon  injuries can occur without fracture on radiography . Gross terlinden et al [52] compared MR I 
and radiography and showed that 15% of ligamentous injuries ( including sprains , partial tears, and complete tears) 
at the syndesmosis in acute ankle injuries on MRI demonstrated no fracture on radiography. Presence o f bone bruise 
and adjacent soft -tissue edema have shown a higher association with acute ligamentous injuries ( anterior talofibular 
ligament most common) and tendon abnormalities [53,54]  in patients with negative radiographs.  MRI can also help 
exclude Salter 1 fractures in the pediatric population [55].",True

Variant  2: Adult  or child older  than  5 years of age. Acute trauma to the foot.  Ottawa  rules can be evaluated  
without  exclusionary  criteria.  Ottawa  rules are positive. Initial imaging.  
Radiograph y Foot  
Radiographs  are indicated  by positive  Ottawa rules with 99% sensitivity  in determining  the presence of a foot 
fracture  [1,9,10] . Radiographs  are the mainstay  of initial imaging in the setting  of acute foot trauma.  Initial  
imaging typically  consists of a 3-view study  with the possibility  of additional  views as indicated  by the clinical  
setting  [8]. Additional  views,  such as axial  calcaneal  view,  can be useful  in patients  with suspected  calcaneal  
fracture  [15] because addition of this view  increases specificity  in diagnosing calcaneal  fractures  and sensitivity  in 
distinguishing intra-articular  calcaneal  fractures.  
Lisfranc  Injury  
When  there is a fairly  high clinical  suspicion  of an acute Lisfranc injury,  the foot should be imaged.  In addition  to 
a typical  3-view  radiographic  study  of the foot (anteroposterior  [AP],  oblique,  and lateral),  an AP view with 20° 
craniocaudal  angulation can be added  [16,17] . Although patients  with Lisfra nc sprains may incur  ligamentous  
damage  without  diastasis [18], radiography  should be the initial imaging modality  in the setting  of a suspected  
Lisfranc injury.

Lisfranc  Injury

proton  density  fat-suppressed  imaging [33,38,41- 45]. There is a high correlation  between  MRI and intraoperative

Page Content: Patellofemoral car tilage loss is also associated with chronic knee pain , with active knee pain correlated with 
BMLs [30,31]. Similar to CT, MRI can calculate various anatomic measurements associated with patellofemoral 
subluxation/dislocation and lateral patellofemoral friction syndrome [32-34]. Bone marrow edema in the classic 
location for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also 
differentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise 
therapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. 
Other etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat 
pad impingement syndromes, Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome, adhesive 
capsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes , 
and osteonecrosis [15, 19,36-45].  
MRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a 
joint effusion. However, contrast -enhanced images ma y be more accurate in diagnosing other causes of chronic 
knee pain , such as Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome, and adhesive 
capsulitis [15].  In particular, enh ancing synovitis thicker than 2 mm in Hoffa’s fat is correlated with peripatellar 
pain [46]. Contrast -enhanced MRI is also useful in quantifying the degree of synovitis and in evaluating 
conditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis [ 17,42,47,48].

effusions may also be identified in the anterior ankle joint recess by radiography with 53% to 74% accuracy  [19]. 
They are often associated with ligamentous injury or fracture [19]. The presence of ossific fragments can indicate 
ligamentous injury or retinaculum avulsion [20], whereas periostitis can occur adjacent to tenosynovitis. 
Radiographs can also identify synovial osteochondromatosis and erosions from chronic synovitis.

Page Content: The MRI findings that have been reported in wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome —
including nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing—may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value 
in patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68]. In rare cases of secondary carpal tunnel syndrome, MRI may identify 
a mass lesion compressing the median nerve. There is some evidence that the length of T2 hyperintensity in the 
median nerve can help prognosticate the success of surgery [69] and that the shape and signal of the nerve predict 
clinical response to a steroid injection in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome [70 ]. MR neurography 
may be an option in patients with suspected carpal tunnel syndrome.  The use o f IV contrast does not contribute to 
diagnosis and is usually not appropriate.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
MR arthrography is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.

Summary of Recommendations  
• Wrist radiographs are indicated as the best initial imaging examination in patients with chronic wrist pain. 
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal and a patient has persistent symptoms wi th an unclear diagnosis, 
MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate.  
• In patients with suspected inflammatory arthritis, MRI either with or without IV contrast is usually 
appropriate if guidance for management or prognostication is needed.  
• Patients with  suspected wrist infection should undergo aspiration.

Once a scaphoid fracture is identified, Radiographic arthrography does not contribute to the evaluation for 
complications of the fracture.  
Variant 12: Chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or nonspecific. Suspect carpal tunnel syndrome.  Next 
study. 
US Wrist 
Several meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the 
carpal  tunnel  inlet) is highly accurate for identifying carpal  tunnel syndrome  diagnosed clinically or with the 
combination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US 
varies depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the 
measurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary 
examination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel 
syndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal 
tunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, 
clinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of 
carpal tunnel syndrome. US may be appropriate in cases where this initial evaluation is equivocal.  
MRI Wrist  
Historically, carpal tunnel syndrome has been diagnosed based on clinical signs and sympt oms and confirmed by 
the results of electrodiagnostic studies [67]. MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in cases in which this  
initial evaluation is equivocal.

Page Content: These factors make CT the 
preferred examination for suspected distal radioulnar joint subluxation, where images of both wrists can be  
obtained in both supination and pronation [1 ,13]. A disadvantage of CT  is its lower sensitivity to soft -tissue 
abnormalities  compared with MRI.  
High-resolution (typically multidetector) CT of the wrist following contrast injection into one or more wrist 
compartments (CT arthrography) is a powerful tool for diagnosing intra -articular abnormalities [14,15]. The 
intraobserver agreement on CT arthrogram images is extremely high and better than that reported for MRI 
[14,16]. 
US 
US of the wrist is useful for examining extra -articular soft tissues, such as suspected ganglion cyst s [17], because 
its accuracy is similar to that of MRI. US can also be used to diagnose abnormalities of the flexor and extensor 
tendons and tendon sheaths. For de Quervain disease (stenosing tenosynovitis of the abductor pollicis lon gus and 
extensor pollicis brevis tendon compartment), preoperative identification of a septum or subcompartmentalization 
within the first dorsal compartment with US  may affect surgical management [18 ,19]. 
In patients with suspected or established rheumatoid arthritis (RA), US examination of the wrist and selected 
finger joints can identify erosions and active synovit is (with the use of power Doppler), findings that influence

osteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite 
versus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess

causes of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg’s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals 
or soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . 
Though radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in 
patients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The

The most commonly used imaging techniques in the diagnosis of Morton’s  neuroma  are MRI and US. It has been 
shown that MRI has a significant effect in the diagnostic and therapeutic decisions made by orthopedic surgeons 
thanks to an increase in their confidence levels and change in treatment [34] . MRI is believed to be a sensitive and 
reliable method to evaluate patients with metatarsalgia and Morton’s  neuroma  with a sensitivity of 87%, specificity 
of 100%, accuracy of 89%, PPV of 100% , and NPV of 60% in surgically treated patients [35] . In a meta- analysis,  
MRI had  a pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio , and negative likelihood ratio of 93%, 68%, 1.89,

demonstrated on MRI [37] . Although the use of gadolinium does not seem essential to detect Morton’s  neuroma s 
[38], it may facilitate its detection  because of  the improved soft -tissue contrast [32,39] .

Page Content: Compared to conventional MRI, CT arthrography may be more sensitive for tears of the biomechanically 
important dorsal ligament fibers [16]. In contrast to MRI and MR arthrography, CT arthrography is less sensitive 
for diagnosis of extra -articular findings (like ganglion cysts and tendon disorders) t hat can cause radial -sided pain.  
CT arthrography may be appropriate in this scenario.  
CT Wrist  
CT, with or without IV contrast,  is not routinely used to further evaluate chronic radial -sided wrist pain when 
radiographs are normal or nonspecific.  
US Wrist  
While some investigators have tried high-resolution US with or  without arthrography for diagnosing intrinsic 
ligament [41,42], its sensitivity in comparison to MRI, MR arthrography, and CT arthrography is unknown. 
Additionally, imaging with US is largely limited to the dorsal fibers of the ligaments [42]. US may be appropriate 
in cases of suspected de Quervain disease (stenosing tenosynovitis of the abductor pollicis longus and extensor 
pollicis brevis tendon compartment), where preoperative identification of a septum or subcompartmentalization 
within the first dorsal compartment with US may affect surgical management [18,19]. US may be appropriate in 
patients with radial -sided pain in cases where extra-articular pathology is the primary consideration.  
Arthrography  Wrist  
Conventional (x-ray) arthrography has largely been supplanted by CT arthrogra phy and MR arthrography because 
these cross-sectional studies are better able to predict which fibers of the scapholunate ligament are torn and 
whether any repairable fibers remain , both of which are important features that affect operative management . 
Additionally, while fibrocartilage and ligament perforations are moderately associated with ulnar -sided wrist pain, 
there is a poor correlation between ligament lesions and radial -sided pain [45].",False

Page Content: The MRI findings that have been reported in wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome —
including nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing—may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value 
in patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68]. In rare cases of secondary carpal tunnel syndrome, MRI may identify 
a mass lesion compressing the median nerve. There is some evidence that the length of T2 hyperintensity in the 
median nerve can help prognosticate the success of surgery [69] and that the shape and signal of the nerve predict 
clinical response to a steroid injection in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome [70 ]. MR neurography 
may be an option in patients with suspected carpal tunnel syndrome.  The use o f IV contrast does not contribute to 
diagnosis and is usually not appropriate.

Summary of Recommendations  
• Wrist radiographs are indicated as the best initial imaging examination in patients with chronic wrist pain. 
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal and a patient has persistent symptoms wi th an unclear diagnosis, 
MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate.  
• In patients with suspected inflammatory arthritis, MRI either with or without IV contrast is usually 
appropriate if guidance for management or prognostication is needed.  
• Patients with  suspected wrist infection should undergo aspiration.

complications of the fracture.  
Variant 12: Chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or nonspecific. Suspect carpal tunnel syndrome.  Next 
study. 
US Wrist 
Several meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the 
carpal  tunnel  inlet) is highly accurate for identifying carpal  tunnel syndrome  diagnosed clinically or with the 
combination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US 
varies depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the 
measurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary 
examination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel 
syndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal 
tunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, 
clinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of 
carpal tunnel syndrome. US may be appropriate in cases where this initial evaluation is equivocal.  
MRI Wrist  
Historically, carpal tunnel syndrome has been diagnosed based on clinical signs and sympt oms and confirmed by 
the results of electrodiagnostic studies [67]. MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in cases in which this  
initial evaluation is equivocal.

Summary  of Recommendations 
• Variant 1 : Radiography pelvis and Radiography hip are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of chronic 
hip pain. These procedures are complementary (ie, more than one procedure is ordered as a set or simultaneously 
in which each procedure provides unique clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 2 : In the setting of chronic hip pain with negative or nondiagnostic radiographs, MRI hip  without IV 
contrast or US hip  is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for suspected noninfectious extra -articular 
abnormality, such as tendonitis or bursitis.  These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure 
will be ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 3 : In the setting of chronic hip pain with negative or nondiagnostic radiographs, MR arthrography hip 
or MRI hip without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for suspected impingement or 
dysplasia. These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be ordered to provide the

Dual -energy CT without  IV contrast may be indicated if gout  or mixed crystal disease is a consideration.  
Otherwise, CT i s not commonly used as a diagnostic test to evaluate patients with osteoarthritis or 
chondrocalcinosis.  Limited CT without IV contrast can be used for surgical planning.  
CT Arthrography  Knee  
CT arthrography is not commonly utilized as a second test in pati ents with arthritis even though CT is the most 
accurate method for evaluating cartilage abnormalities extending to the articular surface that is  due to the high 
spatial resolution between the contrast and the cartilage [11].  
MRI Knee  
MRI without IV contrast is not usually indicated in patients for whom radiographs are diagnostic of osteoarthritis 
unless symptoms are not explained by the radiographic findings (eg, s tress fractures) or the appropriate treatment 
option requires additional imaging [11, 19]. 
Given the increased sensitivity of MRI for osteoarthritis, MRI may be indicated when more accurate or serial 
cartilage measurements are desired [10 ,55,56]. In patients >70 years of age, a higher correlation with the 
“abnormal” knee being painful is present when structural abnormalities are unilateral on either radiographs or 
MRI. S ince bilateral structural abnormalities can be present with primarily unilateral symptoms, the ability to 
discriminate painful from nonpainful knees is limited [57] . This persists even when using the MRI presence of 
synovitis or effusion and/or a Kellgren and Lawrence score of ≥ 2; findings were reported to be the best 
discriminators between painful and asymptomatic knees [19].  
Patellofemoral cartilage loss is closely associated with chronic knee pain with active knee pain correlated with BMLs [56]. Since MRI is more accurate than physical examination in identifying severe grades of 
chondromalacia patellae, it may be an appropriate screening tool prior to arthroscopy [58 ].

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 16 Chronic Shoulder Pain  MRI Shoulder  Without  and With  IV Contrast  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of MRI  shoulder  without  and with IV contrast  in the evaluation  of 
chronic  shoulder  pain with a history  of prior  rotator  cuff repair  when  a rotator  cuff disorder  or subacromial  
subdeltoid bursitis  is suspected.  
MRI Shoulder  Without  IV Contrast  
MRI is useful  in the evaluation  of the postoperative  rotator  cuff. The shift from  metallic  to bioabsorbable  suture  
anchors  tends  to result  in fewer  cases  with metal  artifact  implications  [153] . For patients  with meta llic suture  
anchors,  there are a variety  of commercially  available metal  artifact  reduction sequences,  which  can limit artifact.  
MRI can demonstrate  complications  with suture  anchors  such as osteolys is or migration  [154] , even  if the suture  
anchors  are nonmetallic . MRI can also demonstrate potential improvements  in muscle  atrophy and fatty infiltration  
after rotator  cuff repair  [155,156] .  
Radiography Shoulder  Additional Views  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of additional  radiographic  views in the evaluation  of chronic  
shoulder  pain with a history  of prior  rotator  cuff repair  when  rotator  cuff disorder  or subacromial  subdeltoid bursitis  
is suspected.  
US Shoulder  
An advantage  of US evaluation  of the postoperative  shoulder  is the absence  of metal -induced artifact  when  
examining the rotator  cuff and adjacent  soft tissues.  Patients  who have  undergone  rotator  cuff repair  may show  
discrete defects on US imaging  that may persist  for years with some  potential for delayed  healing  [157] .

MRI can demonstrate femoral  periprosthetic  fractures  and stress reactions [18]. However,  a nondis placed  fracture  
may be difficult to see on MRI if there is only mild associated  marrow edema,  and susceptibility  artifact  from  the

includes  major  and minor  criteria  but not specifically  imaging criteria  [75]. 
Bone  Scan  and Gallium  Scan  Hip 
The most  recent  data on bone  and gallium  scans for diagnosing periprosthetic  hip infection  are more  than 25 years  
old because this test has been  largely  replaced  by labeled  leukocyte  and marrow  imaging  and FDG -PET [77-79].

There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of bone  and gallium  scan with SPECT or SPECT/CT of the hip as 
these tests have  been  replaced  by leukocyte  and bone  marrow  imaging  and FDG-PET for diagnosing  periprosthetic  
hip infection.  
Bone  Scan  Hip 
Bone  scan of the hip is sensitive but not specific for periprosthetic  hip infection.  Performing  the test as a 3-phase  
bone  scan does not improve  accuracy,  with reported  sensitivity  and specificity  ranging  from  29% to 88% and 50% 
to 92%,  respectively  [61,80 -82].

Schweizer  et al [83] retrospectively  studied  58 total hip prostheses,  including  31 symptomati c and 27 asymptomatic  
prostheses,  with bone  scan with SPECT/CT. SPECT/CT identified  the cause of pain in 19 (61%)  of the 31

• Variant 1:  Radiography knee is usually appropriate for the initial imaging of symptomatic or asymptomatic 
patients with a total knee prothesis.  
• Variant 2: Image -guided aspiration knee is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for suspected 
infection after TKA following radiography.  
• Variant 3: In the setting of a painful knee prosthesis evaluated with radiography and when infection has been 
excluded, MRI knee without IV contrast or CT knee without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for  aseptic loosening or osteolysis or instability. These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, 
only one procedure will be ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 4: In the setting of a painful knee  prosthesis evaluated with radiography, CT knee without IV contrast 
is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for suspected periprosthetic or hardware fracture.  
• Variant 5: In the setting of a painful knee prosthesis evaluated with radiography, CT knee without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for measuring component rotation.  
• Variant 6: In the setting of a painful knee prosthesis evaluated with radiography, US knee or MRI knee without 
IV contrast is usually appropriate as t he next imaging study for suspected periprosthetic soft -tissue abnormality 
unrelated to infection, including quadriceps or patellar tendinopathy (quadriceps or patellar tendon tears, 
postoperative arthrofibrosis, patellar clunk syndrome, or impingement of nerves or other soft tissues). These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be ordered to provide the clinical information

Page Content: In a retrospective review of 40 
pathologically confirmed telangiectatic osteosarcomas, Murph ey et al [ 22] noted that CT was the optimal imaging 
modality for demonstration of subtle matrix mineralization seen in 85% of cases in the intraosseous or soft -tissue 
components of the lesion. Not all studies conclude that one modality, CT or MRI, is better than the ot her. A multi-
institutional collaborative study assessing the relative accuracy of CT and MRI in the local staging of primary 
malignant musculoskeletal neoplasms showed no statistically significant difference between CT and MRI in 
determining tumor involvem ent of muscle, bone, joints, or neurovascular structures. Further more , the combined 
interpretation of CT and MRI did not significantly improve accuracy [ 23]. Advanced CT techniques, such as dual -
energy CT, have shown promise in differentiating malignant from nonmalignant tumors, although further research 
in this area is needed [ 24]. MRI is generally considered the preferred imaging modal ity for staging of bone 
tumors. Some cases may benefit from both MRI and CT because these modalities provide  comple mentary 
information regarding soft -tissue (often better evaluated on MR I) and matrix mineralization (often better 
evaluated on CT).  
There is no relevant literature regarding the specific use of CT with IV contrast or CT without and with IV 
contrast in the evaluation of suspected primary bone tumor with radiographs indeterminate for malignancy.  
However, if contrast is given, CT without and with IV contrast is preferred because it allows differentiati on of 
areas of contrast enhancement from areas of osseous matrix production . 
FDG -PET/CT Whole Body  
FDG-PET has proven useful for further characterizing indeterminate bone tumors identified on radiogra phs. PET 
information can be co-registered with CT or MRI, taking advantage of the inherent benefits of these modalities.

bone mass decreases slowly over time, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age, and differs by sex, race, 
ethnicity  [10], and comorbidities. In line with the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations for patients  
ages 65 and older being screened for osteoporosis, patients  >65 years of age may be considered at risk for 
osteoporotic fracture when presenting with LBP . 
Additionally,  for those  patients without  neurologic  compromise  and who present  with minor  risk factors for cancer,  
inflammatory  back  disease  (eg, ankylosing spondylitis), vertebral  compression  fracture,  or symptomatic  spinal  
stenosis,  imaging  should be considered  after a trial of therapy  [4]. 
In the majority  of patients, no specific pathology for LBP can be identified. Also,  studies have  shown  imaging  
abnormalities  in a substantial  number  of people  without back  pain [11-13]. The challenge for the clinician, therefore,  
is to distin guish the small  segment  within  this large patient  population that should be evaluated  further because of 
suspicion  of a more  serious  problem  or identify  pathology that requires intervention . 
Other  nonspine  causes of LBP can have overlap  in clinical  presentation,  including inflammatory  arthritis  and other  
systemic conditions , such as pelvic,  renal,  vascular,  or gastrointestinal  etiologies.  If an inflammatory  etiology  is

MRI.  The visualization  of the convex  posterior  vertebral  body  border,  extension  into the posterior  elements,  and 
abnormal  marrow  signal  are suggestive  of pathologic  fracture  [58]. 
Radiography Lumbar  Spine  
In patients  with history  of osteoporosis  or steroid  use, initial evaluation  with radiography  is useful  [55]. Radiography  
with anteroposterior  and lateral  radiographs  is useful  for assessing  LBP in patients  with low suspicion  of trauma  or 
minor  trauma  and patients  suspected  of having possible vertebral  compression  fracture.  Upright  radiographs  provide  
useful  functional  information  about  axial  loading.  Flexion  and extension  views can be performed  to evaluate for 
spine  stability. Evaluation  of the extent  of vertebral  body  comminution  is limited  on radiography,  particularly  in 
patients with osteoporosis.

A systematic review examining studies that used red flags  as an indication  for screening  found  that of all the red 
flags,  only a history  of cancer  has been  shown  to increase  the probability  of finding spinal  malignancy  [61]. In a 
patient  suspected  of having cancer,  MRI without  and with IV contrast  is considered  superior  in evaluation  of 
localizing  disease (intramedullary, intradural -extramedullary,  and extradural)  as well as assessing  extent  of the

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 10 Shoulder Pain –Traumatic  US Shoulder  
There is no defined role for US  in evaluation of proximal humeral  fractures. Although fractures may sometimes 
be visible on US as areas of cortical interruption, US  is unable to reliably characterize fracture patterns. In ideal 
conditions, US is effective at identifying full-thickness rotator cuff tears that may be associated with humeral head 
fractures [17,22,44]. However, in the acute setting of humeral head fractur e, an US examination of the shoulder is 
significantly limited by decreased patient mobility and swelling. 
FDG -PET/CT  Skull Base to Mid-Thigh 
FDG-PET in combination with CT  has been shown to be reliable in differentiating benign from malignant 
pathologic fr actures [27]. FDG-PET/CT can be used to further assess suspected pathologic fractures of the 
proximal humerus.  
Bone Scan  Shoulder  
Bone scintigraphy has sensitivity and specificity comparable to MRI in diagnosis of occult bone fractures, and 
bone scintigraphy can be used  to identify other foci of bone involvement in pathologic fractures due to metastatic 
disease  [31,32]. Bone scintigraphy can be used  to characterize proximal humerus fractures suspected to be due to 
metastatic disease.  
Variant 4: Traumatic shoulder pain. Radio graphs show scapula fracture.  Next imaging study. 
There is no consensus on indications for surgical fixation of scapula fractures. In general, isolated scapula body 
fractures heal well without surgical fixation, although associated rib fractures or higher injury severity score are 
associated with worse clinical outcomes and may benefit from more aggressive surgical fixation [ 45]. Scapula 
fractures involving the glenoid articular surface or glenoid neck may also require surgical fixation.  
CT Shoulder  
Because of the scapula’s complex osteology and overlying ribs, scapula fractures can be easily missed or 
underappreciate on conventional radiographs.

Radiography Area  of Interest  
Initial imaging  assessment  of a suspected  musculoskeletal  soft tissue mass  should almost  invariably  begin with 
radiographic  evaluation  and is advocated  by ESMO -EURACAN [9]. Radiographs  remain  the modality  best suited  
for the initial assessment  of a suspected  soft tissue mass  and are the initial study  of choice for orthopedic  oncologists  
[25,26] . However,  radiographs  have  limitations  and may not reveal  an abnormality  when  a mass is small, deep -
seated,  nonmineralized,  or in an area with complex  anatomy  such as the flank,  paraspinal  region,  groin,  or deep  soft 
tissues of the hands  and feet [11]. 
US Area  of Interest  
The diagnostic  accuracy  of US is considerably  less when  lesions outside  the subcutaneous tissue are included.  It is 
also less reliable  for defining deep  masses in large anatomical  areas [27]. Although a recent  prospective  study of 
US accuracy  in the characterization  of 134 histologically  proven  deep  soft tissue masses showed  promising results,

Imaging plays  a central  role in characterizing  soft-tissue and osseous infections  in the diabetic foot by identifying  
the location, evaluating  the extent  of involvement,  and detecting  complications , such as soft-tissue abscesses or 
sinus  tracts.  The infected  ulcer  may progress  to soft-tissue abscess,  sinus  tract,  infected  tendon sheath,  
osteomyelitis , or septic arthritis  [29]. If an ulcer  with a positive  probe -to-bone  test is present , the risk of

presence of soft-tissue or osseous infection  and determine the anatomic extent  for treatment  planning.

Page Content: Finally, stress fractures of the femoral head are high  risk in healthy patients and , if not recognized promptly, have 
increased  rates of delayed union, nonunion, displacement, and avascular necrosis [17]. Given the importance of 
recognizing these high-risk fractures in the femoral head and neck, MRI is the preferred second -line study after  
initial negative  radiographs to prevent delayed diagnosis.  
Variant 3: Suspected stress (fatigue) fracture, excluding hip  and vertebrae. Negative radiographs. Next 
imaging study.  
See variant 2. Certain stress fractures are considered high  risk based on a tendency for nonunion or delayed union. 
High -risk stress fractures include the anterior tibial diaphysis, lateral femoral neck and femoral head (see variant 
2), patella, medial malleolus, navicular, fifth metatarsal base, proximal second metatarsal, tibial hallux sesamoid, 
and talus  [43]. 
The second -line test to diagnose a stress fracture should be guided by the location of the patient ’s pain and 
likelihood of high-risk injury. A follow -up radiographic examination has increased sensitivity compared to initial 
radiographs [8] but is less sensitive than MRI. MRI is extremely sensitive and demonstrates stress abnormalities 
as early as bone scintigraphy and with as much sensitivity [ 11-14]. The recent literature favors MRI as the 
procedure of choice for making an early diagnosis of both varieties of stress fractures [ 15-28 ]. MRI is also 
considerably more specifi c than bone scintigraphy [ 19,23]. Stress injuries in athletes that are not identified and 
managed in a timel y fashion can progress to more serious fractures. Preventive strategies, including identifying 
and modifying risk factors, may help deter progression to frank fractures [31,44,45]. 
A circumstance that deserves specific attention is the longitudinal stress fracture, particularly in the tibia. Up to 
25% may appear n ormal on radiographs, but CT or MRI findings are characteristic [ 13,46].

to-play” evaluation . 
See variants 1  through  3. On initial diagnosis, MRI can be used to  predict t ime to return to play in athletes. 
Fredericson et al  [48] retrospectively correlated return to activity with an MRI grading system based on the 
pattern of periosteal and marrow edema on T1-weighted  and fat -suppressed T 2-weighted sequences. Similar 
findings were confirmed in other studies  [49-51] , including  that the finding of abnormal cortical signal intensity 
or a fracture line was of prognostic value [ 51] and that MRI performed better in predicting return to activity than 
radiographs , bone scintigraphy, or CT [50,52]. 
A recent prospective study in university athletes found that MRI grading s everity, total-body bone mineral density 
evaluated by dual -energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and location of injury (ie , cortical or trabecular bone)  
were important variables for predicting time to full return to sport [ 31]. In this study, periosteal edema as 
described by Fredericson et al [ 48] was not associated with return to sport . Using the modified grading scale and a 
multiple regression model, for every 1- unit increase in MRI grade, the time to full return to sport increased by 
approximately 48 days [31] . Furthermore, trabecular st ress injuries (eg , femur neck and pubic bone ) were 
associated with a longer time to return to sport than cortical bone stress injuries. In addition, decreased bone 
mineral density leads to increased time to return to sport . Therefore, bone mineral density provides additional 
diagnostic and prognostic information [31]. The model of MRI  grade, trabecular versus cortical bone sit e, and 
total-body bone mineral density a ccounted for 68% of the variation in time to return to sport [ 31].

Page Content: Computed tomography  
CT is not typically used as a first - or second -line imaging tool in the workup of stress fractures  but may offer an 
adjunct role when other im aging modalities are equivocal [ 23], particularly in the pelvis or sacrum . Although  
superior to radiography, it is less sensitive than nu clear scintigraphy or MRI [19]. The benefit of CT seems to lie 
in its specificity, ranging from 88%  to 98% in a recent meta-analysis looking at diagnostic accuracy of imaging 
modalities for lower -extremity stress fractures, and thus may confirm a suspected stress fracture based on MRI  
[32]. However, CT does involve ionizing radiation, so it is typically used only when MRI is equivocal.  For the 
evaluation of stress fractures, intravenous contrast is not helpful as a part of CT examinations.  
Ultrasound  
There is limited evidence on the u tility of ultrasound in diagnosing stress fractures. Ultrasound is a first -line 
imaging modality in assessing muscles, tendons, joints, and nerves in the extremities  [33], so the radiologist 
should know the typical sono graphic appearance of stress fractures. S onographic findings of s tress fractures 
include  subcutaneous edema , periosteal thickening, cortical bone irregularity, local hyperemia  [33-35 ], and 
periosteal callus.  Overall, ultrasound appears to be more sensitive than specif ic [32], and similar ultrasound 
findings can be seen in osteomyelitis or neoplasm. Furthermore, ultrasound cannot evalua te the subcortical bone, 
so trabecular stress fractures may be missed. Although touted as cheap and quick to perform , it is limited a s an 
operator -dependent modality.

best displayed on MRI, and MRI may be used to guide su rgical interventions [41,43]. For these reasons, the MRI 
examination should include T2-weighted images as well as gradient-echo images. In the subacute and chronic

enlargement of intramedullary cavities,  such as a post-traumatic syringomyelia. 
Although numerous research studies ha ve reported a potential value of diffusion MRI for characterizing spinal

CT Myelography Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
CT myelography can be performed to assess for traumatic spinal canal narrowing that is due to disc herniation or 
epidural hematoma and to assess for preganglionic nerve root avulsions. Ho wever, as with conventional CT, CT 
myelography is inferior to MRI in assessing cord contus ion, cord hemorrhage, and postganglionic nerve root 
injuries [40,41,43,57]. Performance of thoracolumbar CT myelogram can also be technically challenging, 
particularly in patients with suspected  unstable thoracolumbar spine injury. 
CT Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
CT does play a role in the initial assessment of thoracic and lumbar spine injury. However, CT is significantly 
inferior to MRI in identifying many soft-tissue pathologies,  such as cord contusion, epidural hematoma, and nerve 
root avulsions that can cause neurologic deficits re quiring surgical intervention [40,41,43,57]. Therefore, CT 
should not be considered adequate for excluding signifi cant soft-tissue pathology in patients presenting with 
thoracolumbar spine trauma and neurologic deficit. 
MRI Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
MRI should be performed in patients who have possible spinal  cord injury, in whom there is clinical concern for 
cord compression that is due to disc protrusion or hema toma, and in those suspected of ligamentous instability. 
MRI is valuable for characterizing the cause of myelopathy in  patients with spinal cord  injury. The severity of the 
injury—including extent of intramedullary hemorrhage , length of edema, and evidence of cord transection—
contributes to predicting outcome.

Imaging is a crucial component in assessment of thoracic and lumbar spine injury. Fr om 1998 to 2011, there was 
an adjusted annual increase of approximately 8% in thor acolumbar spine fractures in patients involved in motor 
vehicle collisions [15]. Thoracolumbar fractures are cha llenging to identify clinically, with only 48% to 75% of 
thoracolumbar injuries identified on clinical examination [16-18]. Unlike cervical injuries, well-defined clinical 
criteria have not been established to determine when thor acolumbar imaging is appropriate in the setting of blunt 
traumatic injury. Since clinical examination has poor sen sitivity for identifying thoracolumbar injuries, any high-
risk patient (mid line thoracolumbar tenderness, high-energ y mechanism of injury, or >60 years of age), as well as 
unexaminable patients (intoxicated, GCS <15, distracting injury), should undergo imaging of the thoracolumbar 
spine. Screening of the entire spine is advised, as an es timated 20% of spine injuries will have a second associated 
spinal injury at a noncontiguous level [26,27]. 
Radiography  Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
It is well established that CT outperforms radiographs in  the diagnosis of thoracolumbar spine fractures [104-
108]. Radiographs have a reported sens itivity of 49% to 62% for identifying thoracic spine fractures and 67% to 
82% sensitivity for identifying lumbar spine fractures [ 104,107,108] compared with the reported sensitivity of 
94% to 100% for identifying thoracolumbar spine fract ures using CT [104,107,108].

MRI Lumbar Spine Without IV Contrast  
MRI lumbar  spine  without  IV contrast  is most  useful  in the evaluation  of suspected  CES, multifocal deficit, or 
progressive  neurologic  deficit  because of its ability  to accurately  depict  soft-tissue pathology,  assess vertebral  
marrow,  and assess the spinal  canal  patency.  A prospective  cohort  study by Bell et al [41] recommends urgent  MRI  
assessment  in all patients  who present  with new-onset  urinary  symptoms  in the context  of LBP or sciatica.  Recently, 
a single  3-D heavily  T2-weighted  fat-saturated  sequence protocol  has been  shown  to be a rapid,  highly sensitive 
tool for evaluating  CES in the emergency  department  that can be utilized  for improved efficiency  and emergency

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 6 Myelopathy patients  with relapsing -remitting  MS [12]. When myelopathy due to MS is suspected,  MRI detection  of spinal  cord 
lesion(s)  fulfills  part of the 2016  MAGNIMS  criteria  [63]. Other  demyelinating  processes such as NMO and ADEM  
can present  as chronic  myelopathy less commonly.  In patients  with chronic  or progressive myelopathy,  MRI  of the 
spinal  cord can identify  spinal  cord lesions suggestive  of demyelinating  disease in addition  to excluding  alternative  
etiologie s. Contrast -enhanced  imaging  is recommended  for initial diagnostic  evaluation  [69,70] . 
Metabolic  causes of chronic  or progressive  myelopathy result  in changes in the spinal  cord known  as subacute 
combined degeneration  and are best evaluated  with MRI [11,83,84] . Chronic  infections  can have  a similar  
appearance [12].  
Radiation -induced  myelopathy is a rare dose-dependent  complication  that anatomically  localizes to a prior  radiation  
port [85]. Autoimmune  myelitis  includes  paraneoplastic myelopathy [86,87] . MRI  without  and with IV contrast  is 
useful  to evaluate the spinal  cord in these instances.  
Vascular  malformations  can likewise present  with chronic  and slowly  progressive  myelopathy [88]. MRI without  
and with IV contrast  is useful  to demonstrate spinal  cord edema  caused  by venous  hypertension and enlarged  veins  
along the dorsal  surface of the spinal  cord.  There may be patchy  intramedullary  enhancement  due to breakdown  of 
the blood-cord  barrier.  In some  cases,  abnormal  vasculature may be identified  that may be useful  to guide  spinal  
arteriography  and intervention [5,89-91] .

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 4 Myelopathy Intramedullary  cord signal  changes on MRI in patients with spondylotic  myelopathy represent  prognostic  factors  
for neurosurgical  outcome  [21,37-41] . Intravenous  (IV) contrast  is typically  not required  for the diagnosis  of 
spondylotic  myelopathy,  but characteristic patterns of enhancement  can be seen immediately  at and below  a level  
of stenosis [42,43] . 
In patients  who have  undergone  spinal  surgery,  complications  in the early  postoperative  setting  (eg, hematoma)  can 
result  in extrinsic compression  of the spinal  cord and are best evaluated  using  MRI without  and with IV contrast  
[44]. 
In cases in which spinal  cord ischemia is suspected  as the cause for acute myelopathy,  MRI without and with IV 
contrast is useful in cases where spinal cord ischemic is suspected as the cause for acute myelopathy  [27,28,45-47] . 
Contrast  enhancement  is typically  not seen in the early  phase of acute ischemia and, if present,  may suggest  an 
alternative  inflammatory  or infectious  etiolog y [48]. Diffusion -weighted  imaging  can show  signal  alteration  in the 
spinal  cord earlier  after patient symptom  onset  compared  with T2-weighted  images  [49,50] . As such,  diffusion-
weighted  imaging  should be included anytime  there is concern  for spinal  cord ischemia [51]. 
When  considering  inflammatory  or infections  etiologies  of myelopathy,  visualization  of the osseous spinal column 
as well as the spinal  cord is useful  and best accomplished  noninvasively by MRI [4,7,45,52 -60]. 
Demyelinating  diseases such as MS and NMO can present  as acute myelopathy.

spin-echo or 3-D grad ient-recalled pulse sequences [36]. There is some evidence suggesting that MRI performed 
with a 3.0 T system is even more accurate than MRI performed with a 1.5 T system for TFCC lesions [37], but 
there are no studies comparing the accuracy of the two field s trengths in the same patients. The sensitivity for 
tears of the ulnar attachment of the disc and the peripheral attachments (the ulnocarpal ligaments) are only fair 
with noncontrast -enhanced wrist MRI [ 12,36].

Variant 4: Chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or show nonspecific ar thritis. Exclude infection. Next 
study. 
Aspiration  Wrist  
No literature directly addresses the appropriateness of imaging studies beyond radiographs in patients with 
suspected infection in the wrist. However, generalizing from experience with septic arthrit is in other joints, joint 
aspiration should not be delayed in order to obtain advanced imaging studies. In cases of suspected septic arthritis, 
percutaneous aspiration of the wrist is indicated, even when radiographs appear normal. Aspirates should be 
analyzed by cell count, gram stain, and appropriate cultures. Microscopic crystal analysis should also be obtained 
if there is a possibility of gout, acute pseudogout, or hydroxyapatite deposition disease. Aspiration can be 
performed without imaging guidance i f the joint is distended, but either fluoroscopy or US  may be useful if a 
specific compartment is to be targeted.  
MRI Wrist  
There may be a role for MRI with IV contrast enhancement in the staging of infections (for example, to delineate the location and extent of soft-tissue abscesses)  after aspiration has been performed.  Especially in chronic cases, 
MRI with IV contrast may be useful to identify a fluid collection or joint effusion to target  for aspiration.  
However, MRI is usually not appropriate as the next study after radiographs for suspected wrist infections.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
MR arthrography is not routinely used to evaluate suspected wrist infection.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 12 Shoulder Pain –Traumatic  MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography is the preferred exam ination  for the evaluation of subacute shoulder dislocations or recurrent 
shoulder instability. MRI has been shown to have similar performance to CT in the evaluation of Hill-Sachs 
lesions and glenoid bone loss [12,18]. MR arthrography has also been found to be reliable in diagnosi ng anterior 
shoulder instability and labroligamentous injuries [58,59]. MR arthrography has specifically o utperformed 
noncontrast MRI in assessment of glenohumeral ligament and anterior labral injuries [ 17,19], which ar e 
commonly seen in shoulder instability. MR arthrogr aphy has also outperformed noncontrast MRI in diagnosis of 
rotator cuff tears [17,19], which is a common associated finding in older patients with shoulder dislocation. 
However, high sensitivities reported for MR arthrography in the detection of labral pathology may not be 
applicable to patients with clinically unstable shoulders. A retrospective review of 90 patients with clinically 
unstable shoulders selected for arthroscopy [ 60] found that MR arthrography had a sensitivity of 65% for 
detection of labral  tears. The authors proposed that this discrepancy with prior studies was the result of different 
patient selection criteria (clinically unstable in their study versus less-specific symptoms such as shoulder pain in 
others) and the interpretation of MR art hrography by experienced musculoskeletal radiologists [ 60]. For this 
document, it is assumed the procedure is performed and interpreted by an expert.  
MRI Shoulder  
MRI without contrast may be pre ferred to MR arthrography in the setting of acute shoulder dislocation when a 
post-traumatic joint effusion is present to provide sufficient visualization of soft -tissue structures.

Page Content: US Area of Interest  
US is superior to radiography for detection of radiolucent foreign bodies and is recommended as the first choice 
when the foreign body is located within the superficial soft  tissues with no bone around it [ 78,79,83]. 
US allows for  better  localization of radiopaque foreig n bodies, assessment of tendons and vascular structures, and 
US-guided removal of the foreign body [77]. 
Bone Scan Area of  Interest  
Bone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  
Summary of R ecommendations 
• Variant 1: Radiographs area of interest is usually appropriate for the initial imaging of adults with acute 
blunt or penetrating trauma to the hand or wrist.  
• Variant 2: Repeat radiographs in 10– 14 days, MRI without IV contrast, or CT without  IV contrast is usually 
appropriate as the next imaging study for adults with acute hand or wrist trauma when initial radiographs are 
negative or equivocal. These procedures are equivalent alternatives.  
• Variant 3: MR arthrography of wrist, MRI of wrist wit hout IV contrast, CT arthrography of wrist, or US  of 
wrist  is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for adults with suspected wrist tendon or ligament 
trauma and when radiographs show acute wrist fracture. These procedures are equivalent alternativ es. 
• Variant 4: CT of both wrists without IV contrast, MRI of wrist without IV contrast, or MR arthrography of 
wrist is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for adults when initial radiographs shows distal 
radioulnar joint or carpal malalignment in  the absence of fracture. These procedures are equivalent 
alternatives.  
• Variant 5: MRI of hand without IV contrast or US of hand is usually appropriate as the next imaging study 
for adults with suspect hand tendon or ligament trauma and when radiographs show acute hand fracture. 
These procedures are equivalent alternatives.

Variant 4: Initial radiographs showing distal radioulnar joint or carpal malalignment in the absence of 
fracture. Next imaging study.  
CT Wrist  
CT is the modality of choice for evaluating distal  radioulnar joint stability [54]. The CT protocol should include 
imaging of both wrists in maximal pronation, neutral position, and maximal supination.  
CT examin ation with coronal, sagittal, and 3 -D reformed images help demonstrate the extent of injury and help in 
treatment planning, particularly in cases of chronic perilunate dislocation [ 55]. 
CT Arthrography  Wrist  
Distal radioulnar joint instability and traumatic triangular f ibrocartilage injuries can be evaluated with CT 
arthrography [56,57]. 
MRI Wrist  
Distal radioulnar joint instability and traumatic triangular fibrocartilage injuries are usually associated with fluid 
in the distal radioulnar joint , which aids in the evaluation of the triangular fibrocartilage components on 
conventional MRI.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
MR arthrograph y increases the diagnostic accuracy for proximal lamina (foveal) triangular fibrocartilage tears 
[56,57].

comparable [38]. 
The accuracy of MRI for extrinsic ligament assessment is unknown [ 37]. 
Extensor carpi ulnaris tendinopathy, tenosynovitis, and tendon rupture can be evaluated with MRI or US [43]. 
However, dynamic instability may be missed on MRI, unless sequences are performed in pronation and 
supination [44]. 
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
At 1.5T, MR arthrography has greater sensitivity compared with conventional MRI [ 45,46]. Both MRI and MR 
arthrography have poor to moderate sensitivity for partial ligament tears [ 47,48]. When only complete tears are 
considered, MRI and MR arthrography may be equivalent [ 33]. 
The accuracy of  MR arthrography for extrinsic ligament assessment is unknown [ 37]. 
US Wrist  
High -frequency US is useful for visualizing wrist tendons as well as intrinsic and extrinsic carpal ligaments 
[44,49,50]. Dynamic “clenched fist” maneuvers may be performed to improve detection of low -grade injuries 
[51]. 
For tears of the dorsal band of the scapholunate ligament, US  sensitivity varies from 46 % to 100% and specificity 
from 92 % to 100% [50-52 ]. For the dorsal band of the lunotriquetral ligament, US  sensitivity ranges from 25 % to 
50% and specificity from 90% to 100% [52,53]. US visualization of lunotriquetral ligament (particularly the 
structurally important volar band) is limited [ 49]. 
US can show dynamic subluxation of the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon during forced supination [ 44].
