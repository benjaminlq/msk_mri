Rather , the interest has been in \nthe use of dynamic MRI to evaluate femoral head perfusion for prognostic purpose to estimate the risks of \nimpaired perfusion,  such as osteonecrosis and non union. In one study of 36 patients, impaired femoral head \nperfusion was mor e common in patients with displaced fractures,  although there was considerable overlap of \nperfusion pattern and fracture type [44]. The accuracy of predicting successful osseous union was 75% based on \nfracture morphology and improved incrementally to 89% on the basis of perfusion dynamics.

A wide variety  of pathological  entities  may cause hip pain, \nincluding  osseous  as well as intra- or extra -articular  soft tissue abnormalities  [5-7]. Pathology  involving  the lumbar  \nspine,  sacroiliac,  or knee  joints  can also cause hip pain [8], and these  etiologies  should  be investigated  as needed . \nThere is limited  original  research  that specifically  targets the imaging  of chronic  hip pain,  but imaging  of specific  \nconditions  is widely  discussed  in the published  literature. \nBefore  imaging,  an appropriate  assessment  of a patient\u2019s  clinical  history  and physical  examination  is essential  in \ntrying  to pare down the range  of possible etiologies  for a patient\u2019s  symptoms.", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "ACR chronic hip pain.pdf"}, "score": 0.31279629468917847}, {"page_content": "ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 10 Chronic  Hip Pain Radiography Hip Additional Views \nFor further evaluation  of disorders  such as dysplasia or FAI, specialized  views such as the false  profile  or elongated  \nfemoral  neck  lateral  (Dunn)  views  can provide  more  detailed  evaluation  of the anatomy  of the femoral  head  and \nneck  and the degree of acetabular  coverage of the femoral  head  [47]. \nUS Hip \nIn general,  US is limited  in its use for evaluating  osseous structures.

A wide variety  of pathological  entities  may cause hip pain, \nincluding  osseous  as well as intra- or extra -articular  soft tissue abnormalities  [5-7]. Pathology  involving  the lumbar  \nspine,  sacroiliac,  or knee  joints  can also cause hip pain [8], and these  etiologies  should  be investigated  as needed . \nThere is limited  original  research  that specifically  targets the imaging  of chronic  hip pain,  but imaging  of specific  \nconditions  is widely  discussed  in the published  literature. \nBefore  imaging,  an appropriate  assessment  of a patient\u2019s  clinical  history  and physical  examination  is essential  in \ntrying  to pare down the range  of possible etiologies  for a patient\u2019s  symptoms.", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "ACR chronic hip pain.pdf"}, "score": 0.3125879764556885}, {"page_content": "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 11 Imaging After Total Hip Arthroplasty  hip replacements and 33 patients  who had pain in the hip after arthroplasty  and radiologic  findings  consistent  with \ncomponent  loosening (6 of whom  had infection ).

Fr om 1998 to 2011, there was \nan adjusted annual increase of approximately 8% in thor acolumbar spine fractures in patients involved in motor \nvehicle collisions [15]. Thoracolumbar fractures are cha llenging to identify clinically, with only 48% to 75% of \nthoracolumbar injuries identified on clinical examination [16-18]. Unlike cervical injuries, well-defined clinical \ncriteria have not been established to determine when thor acolumbar imaging is appropriate in the setting of blunt \ntraumatic injury. Since clinical examination has poor sen sitivity for identifying thoracolumbar injuries, any high-\nrisk patient (mid line thoracolumbar tenderness, high-energ y mechanism of injury, or >60 years of age), as well as \nunexaminable patients (intoxicated, GCS <15, distracting injury), should undergo imaging of the thoracolumbar \nspine. Screening of the entire spine is advised, as an es timated 20% of spine injuries will have a second associated \nspinal injury at a noncontiguous level [26,27]. \nRadiography  Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nIt is well established that CT outperforms radiographs in  the diagnosis of thoracolumbar spine fractures [104-\n108]. Radiographs have a reported sens itivity of 49% to 62% for identifying thoracic spine fractures and 67% to \n82% sensitivity for identifying lumbar spine fractures [ 104,107,108] compared with the reported sensitivity of \n94% to 100% for identifying thoracolumbar spine fract ures using CT [104,107,108].", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "ACR suspected spine trauma.pdf"}, "score": 0.30694037675857544}, {"page_content": "Table 3.

Duration  of symptoms  also helps  guide  treatment  algorithms  in \npatients  with acute,  subacute,  or chronic  LBP.

When myelopathy due to MS is suspected,  MRI detection  of spinal  cord \nlesion(s)  fulfills  part of the 2016  MAGNIMS  criteria  [63]. Other  demyelinating  processes such as NMO and ADEM  \ncan present  as chronic  myelopathy less commonly.  In patients  with chronic  or progressive myelopathy,  MRI  of the \nspinal  cord can identify  spinal  cord lesions suggestive  of demyelinating  disease in addition  to excluding  alternative  \netiologie s. Contrast -enhanced  imaging  is recommended  for initial diagnostic  evaluation  [69,70] . \nMetabolic  causes of chronic  or progressive  myelopathy result  in changes in the spinal  cord known  as subacute \ncombined degeneration  and are best evaluated  with MRI [11,83,84] . Chronic  infections  can have  a similar  \nappearance [12].  \nRadiation -induced  myelopathy is a rare dose-dependent  complication  that anatomically  localizes to a prior  radiation  \nport [85]. Autoimmune  myelitis  includes  paraneoplastic myelopathy [86,87] . MRI  without  and with IV contrast  is \nuseful  to evaluate the spinal  cord in these instances.  \nVascular  malformations  can likewise present  with chronic  and slowly  progressive  myelopathy [88]. MRI without  \nand with IV contrast  is useful  to demonstrate spinal  cord edema  caused  by venous  hypertension and enlarged  veins  \nalong the dorsal  surface of the spinal  cord.  There may be patchy  intramedullary  enhancement  due to breakdown  of \nthe blood-cord  barrier.  In some  cases,  abnormal  vasculature may be identified  that may be useful  to guide  spinal  \narteriography  and intervention [5,89-91] .", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "ACR myelopathy.pdf"}, "score": 0.3570753335952759}, {"page_content": "In patients  who have  undergone  spinal  surgery,  late complications  (eg, adjacent  level  degenerative  disease with \nspinal  stenosis,  recurrent  disc herniation)  can result  in extrinsic  compression  of the spinal  cord and are best evaluated  \nusing MRI without  and with IV contrast  [44]. \nDemyelinating  diseases such as MS can present  as subacute/chronic myelopathy.
