Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and \nit can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain \nwith the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. \nTypically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain \npersists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  \nimaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated \nthat approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the \nprior year) radiographs [2 ]. \nThis document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  \u22655 years of age.", "metadata": {"source": "ACR chronic knee pain.pdf", "page": "4"}}, {"page_content": "Variant 5:  Adult or child greater than or equal to 5 years of age.

New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or \npatients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee \npain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the \norigin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. \nSubchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed \nspontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to \nelderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs \noften initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, \nand progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is \nsuspected clinically.

Chronic ankle  pain can be caused by a variety \nof osseous or soft -tissue abnormalities, either alone or in combination. For assessing chronic ankle pain, there are \nmultiple imaging options, including radiography, stress radiography,  computed tomography (CT)  radionuclide \nbone scanning, ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and various injection procedures. Injection \nproce dures include arthrography, CT arthrography, MR arthrography, and diagnostic injection with anesthetic \nagents. Although there are numerous causes for chronic ankle pain, common etiologies include osteoarthritis, \nosteochondral injury, tendon abnormalities, ligament abnormalities and instability, and impingement.  \nOverview of Imaging Modalities  \nRadiography Radiographs can provide information about the osseous and soft -tissue structures about the ankle. Routine \nradiographs of the ankle typically include anteroposterior, lateral, and mortise views, the latter obtained by internally rotating the foot 15 to 20 degrees.", "metadata": {"source": "ACR chronic ankle pain.pdf", "page": "5"}}, {"page_content": "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 6 Chronic Ankle Pain  osteochondral abnormalities  [14-16], although one study found statistically significant lower sensitivity for these \nabnormalities on MR I as compared to arthroscopy [ 17].

Kransdorf, MD.p \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nTraumatic shoulder pain is shoulder pain believed to be directly attributed to a traumatic event, either acute or \nchronic. This pain may be the result of either fracture (the clavicle, scapula, or proximal humerus) or soft -tissue \ninjury (most commonly of the rotator cuff, acromioclavicular ligaments, or labroligamentous complex). The \nincidence of traumatic shoulder injuries is difficult to determine because some injury types, such as low-grade \nacromioclavicular separations or acute rotator cuff tears, are likely under -reported because patients  do not seek \nimmediate medical treatment. However, as with many traumatic injuries, traumatic shoulder pain tends to \ndisproportionately involve young adults and male patients [ 1,2]. \nThe etiology of traumatic shoulder pain can often be made based on clinical examination, radiographs, and \nmechanism of injury. Traumatic shoulder injuries can generally be separated into in juries requiring acute surgical \nmanagement and injuries in which conservative management can be attempted prior to considering surgical \ntreatment. Unstable or significantly displaced fractures and joint instability are injuries most likely requiring acute \nsurgical treatment.", "metadata": {"source": "ACR shoulder pain traumatic.pdf", "page": "6"}}, {"page_content": "Most soft -tissue injuries (such as labral tears and rotator cuff tears) can undergo a period of \nconservative management prior to considering surgery. However, in addition to the specific imaging findings \nrelated to a traumatic injury, indications and timing of surgical treatment of many traumatic shoulder injuries are \ndependent on patient age, comorbidities, current activity level, and expected activity level.  \nImaging of chronic shoulder pain is beyond the scope of this topic  and is cove red in the  ACR Appropriateness \nCriteria\u00ae on \u201cShoulder Pain\u2013 Atraumatic \u201d [3]. \nDiscussion o f Procedures  by Variant  \nVariant 1:  Traumatic shoulder pain. Any etiology . Initial imaging . \nRadiography Shoulder  \nRadiographs are the preferred initial study performed in the setting of traumatic shoulder pain . They can delineate \nshoulder malalignment and most shoulder fractures [ 4,5]. A standard set of shoulder radiographs for trauma \nshould include at least three  views: anterior -posterior (AP) views in internal and external rotation and an axillary \nor scapula-Y view. Axillary or scapula-Y views are vital in evaluating traumatic shoulder injuries as \nacromioclavicular and glenohumeral dislocations can be misclassified on AP  views [6,7]. Radiographs provide \ngood delineation of bony anatomy to assess for fracture and appropriate shoulder alignment, which are the two \nprimary concerns in management of acute traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs should also be performed upright \nsince malalignment of the shoul der can be under -represented on supine radiographs [ 4]. Additional views, such as \nthe Bernageau view, have been sho wn to be effective in demonstrating the degree of bone loss of the glenoid or \nhumeral head [ 8]. \nCT Shoulder  \nComputed tomography ( CT) is better able than radiogr aphs to characteriz e fracture patterns [ 9-11].", "metadata": {"source": "ACR shoulder pain traumatic.pdf", "page": "6"}}, {"page_content": "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 10 Shoulder Pain \u2013Traumatic  US Shoulder  \nThere is no defined role for US  in evaluation of proximal humeral  fractures. Although fractures may sometimes \nbe visible on US as areas of cortical interruption, US  is unable to reliably characterize fracture patterns. In ideal \nconditions, US is effective at identifying full-thickness rotator cuff tears that may be associated with humeral head \nfractures [17,22,44]. However, in the acute setting of humeral head fractur e, an US examination of the shoulder is \nsignificantly limited by decreased patient mobility and swelling. \nFDG -PET/CT  Skull Base to Mid-Thigh \nFDG-PET in combination with CT  has been shown to be reliable in differentiating benign from malignant \npathologic fr actures [27]. FDG-PET/CT can be used to further assess suspected pathologic fractures of the \nproximal humerus.  \nBone Scan  Shoulder  \nBone scintigraphy has sensitivity and specificity comparable to MRI in diagnosis of occult bone fractures, and \nbone scintigraphy can be used  to identify other foci of bone involvement in pathologic fractures due to metastatic \ndisease  [31,32].

This pain may be the result of either fracture (the clavicle, scapula, or proximal humerus) or soft -tissue \ninjury (most commonly of the rotator cuff, acromioclavicular ligaments, or labroligamentous complex). The \nincidence of traumatic shoulder injuries is difficult to determine because some injury types, such as low-grade \nacromioclavicular separations or acute rotator cuff tears, are likely under -reported because patients  do not seek \nimmediate medical treatment. However, as with many traumatic injuries, traumatic shoulder pain tends to \ndisproportionately involve young adults and male patients [ 1,2]. \nThe etiology of traumatic shoulder pain can often be made based on clinical examination, radiographs, and \nmechanism of injury. Traumatic shoulder injuries can generally be separated into in juries requiring acute surgical \nmanagement and injuries in which conservative management can be attempted prior to considering surgical \ntreatment.
