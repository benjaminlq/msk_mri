Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Traumatic shoulder pain is shoulder pain believed to be directly attributed to a traumatic event, either acute or 
chronic. This pain may be the result of either fracture (the clavicle, scapula, or proximal humerus) or soft -tissue 
injury (most commonly of the rotator cuff, acromioclavicular ligaments, or labroligamentous complex). The 
incidence of traumatic shoulder injuries is difficult to determine because some injury types, such as low-grade 
acromioclavicular separations or acute rotator cuff tears, are likely under -reported because patients  do not seek 
immediate medical treatment. However, as with many traumatic injuries, traumatic shoulder pain tends to 
disproportionately involve young adults and male patients [ 1,2]. 
The etiology of traumatic shoulder pain can often be made based on clinical examination, radiographs, and 
mechanism of injury. Traumatic shoulder injuries can generally be separated into in juries requiring acute surgical 
management and injuries in which conservative management can be attempted prior to considering surgical 
treatment. Unstable or significantly displaced fractures and joint instability are injuries most likely requiring acute 
surgical treatment.

Score: 0.734216862192465","condition: shoulder pain traumatic

Most soft -tissue injuries (such as labral tears and rotator cuff tears) can undergo a period of 
conservative management prior to considering surgery. However, in addition to the specific imaging findings 
related to a traumatic injury, indications and timing of surgical treatment of many traumatic shoulder injuries are 
dependent on patient age, comorbidities, current activity level, and expected activity level.  
Imaging of chronic shoulder pain is beyond the scope of this topic  and is cove red in the  ACR Appropriateness 
Criteria® on “Shoulder Pain– Atraumatic ” [3]. 
Discussion o f Procedures  by Variant  
Variant 1:  Traumatic shoulder pain. Any etiology . Initial imaging . 
Radiography Shoulder  
Radiographs are the preferred initial study performed in the setting of traumatic shoulder pain . They can delineate 
shoulder malalignment and most shoulder fractures [ 4,5]. A standard set of shoulder radiographs for trauma 
should include at least three  views: anterior -posterior (AP) views in internal and external rotation and an axillary 
or scapula-Y view. Axillary or scapula-Y views are vital in evaluating traumatic shoulder injuries as 
acromioclavicular and glenohumeral dislocations can be misclassified on AP  views [6,7]. Radiographs provide 
good delineation of bony anatomy to assess for fracture and appropriate shoulder alignment, which are the two 
primary concerns in management of acute traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs should also be performed upright 
since malalignment of the shoul der can be under -represented on supine radiographs [ 4]. Additional views, such as 
the Bernageau view, have been sho wn to be effective in demonstrating the degree of bone loss of the glenoid or 
humeral head [ 8]. 
CT Shoulder  
Computed tomography ( CT) is better able than radiogr aphs to characteriz e fracture patterns [ 9-11].

Bone Scan  Shoulder  
There is no role for bone scintigraphy in assessment of Bankart or Hill -Sachs lesions.  
Variant 6: Traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs normal.  Physical examination and history consistent 
with dislocation event  or instability . Next imaging study. 
Shoulder dislocation or instability is most co mmon in the anterior direction. Younger patients are more likely to 
have labroligamentous injury and persistent instability after dislocation compared with older patients [54]. Older 
patients are more likely to have rotator cuff tears in association with shoulder dislocation [ 55]. Coexisting 
humeral avulsion of the glenohumeral ligament and significant glenoid bone loss have been found in up to 10% of 
patients with recurrent shoulder instability [ 56], which underscores the need to assess both osseous and 
labroligamentous pathology in patients with shoulder dislocation or instability. Glenoid morphology and bone 
loss can play a significant factor in recurrent shoulder dislocations [15, 16,57], which may require bone grafting in 
order to restore stability [ 57].

ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 8 Shoulder Pain –Traumatic  Variant 2: Traumatic shoulder pain. Nonlocalized shoulder pain. Negative radiographs . Next imaging 
study. 
Appropriately positioned  radiographs can exclude shoulder dislocation and most displaced fractures as the 
etiology for post -traumatic shoulder pain. In the setting of normal shoulder radiographs, the most common causes 
of post -traumatic shoulder pain are soft -tissue injuries such  as rotator cuff and labral tears.  
MRI Shoulder  
Noncontrast MRI is a reasonable imaging study in the setting of acute nonlocalized traumatic shoulder pain and 
noncontributory radiographs. In the acute trauma setting, noncontrast MRI may be preferred to MR arthrography , 
as acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint effusion for assessment of intra -articular 
soft-tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic 
pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [34,35]. MRI is also sensitive for diagnosing bone marrow 
contusion and has  been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries in pediatric patients [ 36,37]. 
MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography has been found to be superior to noncontrast MRI in the diagnosis of labroligamentous and 
partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [17,19]. In the acute trauma setting, however, noncontrast MRI may be 
preferred to MR arthrography because acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint 
effusion for assessment of intra-arti cular soft -tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing 
extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [ 34,35]. MRI is also sensitive 
for diagnosing bone marrow contusion and has been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries 
in pediatric patients [ 36,37].

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Axial  spondyloarthritis  or axial  spondyloarthropathy (axSpA)  describes a heterogeneous  group of inflammatory  
disorders  affecting  the axial  skeleton  that were historically  classified  separately  as ankylosing  spondylitis  (AS) , 
reactive arthritis, psoriatic  spondyloarthritis,  enteropathic  spondyloarthritis,  juvenile  spondyloarthritis , and 
undifferentiated  spondyloarthritis  [1]. The prevalen ce of axSpA  is estimated  to be between  0.9% to 1.4%  in the 
United  States  adult  population [2]. There  is a genetic component  to axSpA,  including  a strong  association  with 
HLA-B27 , which  is positive  in 74% to 89% of patients  [1]. Patients  with axSpA  often  present  before  age 45 with 
chronic  back  pain and stiffness and may have  elevated  inflammatory  markers  [3].

MRI  can also detect  chronic  structural  changes on 
axSpA  in the sacroiliac joints, although  the clinical  utility  of follow -up for that purpose  is not established  [137] . 
Noncontrast  and contrast -enhanced  MRI have  overall similar  diagnostic  utility  for evaluation  of the sacroiliac joints  
in axSpA  [107-111] . The Spondyloarthritis  Research  Consortium  of Canada method has been  utilized  as a scoring  
system  for quantification  and follow -up of lesions at the sacroiliac joints  on MRI  [138] . 
MRI Sacroiliac  Joints  and Spine  Area  of Interest  
There is no standard  method of following  patients with MRI to evaluate for treatment  response or disease  
progression [22,30] . Although multiple  studies demonstrate decreasing  inflammation  on MRI  follow ing treatment  
with TNF -inhibitors, including some  long-term  studies showing sustained  reduction in inflammation, the degree to 
which  MRI findings  correlate with disease activity  is variable [30]. The American  College  of Rheumatology and 
European League Against  Rheumatism  agree that the decision  to repeat  MRI to assess disease activity  or monitor  
for disease  response  depends  on the clinical  circumstances [22,30] . Specifically,  MRI of the sacroiliac joints  and 
spine  may be helpful  for cases in which  the disease  activity  is unclear,  available  clinical  or laboratory data are 
conflicting, or knowledge  of MRI findings  is expected  to alter treatment  [30]. MRI  can also detect  chronic  structural

Bone  Scan  with  SPECT  or SPECT/CT  Spine  Area  of Interest  
Bone  scintigraphy is not routinely  suggested  in the evaluation  of patients  with suspected  axSpA  because of  its lack 
of established  diagnostic  utility  [22]. Conventional  bone  scintigraphy has low to moderate sensitivity  and variable  
specificity  for the diagnosis  of axSpA  [41,42,50] . If bone  scintigraphy is used,  because of  the complexity  of the 
spine anatomy,  the use of SPECT should be performed  during  the examination  [51]. Although  bone  scintigraphy is 
not typically  performed  during the evaluation  of suspected  axSpA  because of  its limited  diagnostic  utility, there is 
recent  data that hybrid SPECT/CT has higher  sensitivity  than conventional  bone  scintigraphy in the detection  of 
sacroiliitis  [52,53] , although  there  is not enough evidence at this time to support  its routine  use for evaluating  the

axSpA  [66,67] ; however,  there is conflicting  evidence regarding the extent  to which  tracer  uptake  correlates with 
specific inflammatory  and structural  lesions seen on CT and MRI resulting  in uncertain ty about  its diagnostic  utility  
[64,67- 72]. In one study,  the interreader  reliability  of diagnosing  sacroiliitis  on PET/CT was poor and substantially  
lower  than that for MRI or CT [67]. In a small  study using  radiographs  as the reference standard,  F-18-fluoride

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Hand injuries account for approximately 20% of emergency department visits [ 1]. According to the National 
Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey , 1.5% of all emergency department visits involve  hand and wrist 
fractu res. Distal radius fractures are especially common, accounting for up to 18% of fractures in the elderly [ 2,3]. 
Because of increasing rates of osteoporosis, the incidence of distal radius fractures has been increasing [ 4]. 
Although most distal radius fractures in e lderly patients are managed non operatively, the use of internal fixation is 
increasing. Internal fixation has a much higher cost than nonopera tive treatment as well as increased rates of 
hospitalization [5]. 
For most patients with trauma to the hand and wrist, conventional radiographs provide sufficient diagnostic 
information to guide the treating physician.  However, delayed diagnosis is common because distal radius and 
scaphoid fractures may be radiographically occult  [6]. When initial radiographs  are normal but there is high 
clinical suspicion for fracture, further imaging with additional radiographic pr ojections, CT, or MRI  is 
appropriate .

US Area of Interest  
US is superior to radiography for detection of radiolucent foreign bodies and is recommended as the first choice 
when the foreign body is located within the superficial soft  tissues with no bone around it [ 78,79,83]. 
US allows for  better  localization of radiopaque foreig n bodies, assessment of tendons and vascular structures, and 
US-guided removal of the foreign body [77]. 
Bone Scan Area of  Interest  
Bone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  
Summary of R ecommendations 
• Variant 1: Radiographs area of interest is usually appropriate for the initial imaging of adults with acute 
blunt or penetrating trauma to the hand or wrist.  
• Variant 2: Repeat radiographs in 10– 14 days, MRI without IV contrast, or CT without  IV contrast is usually 
appropriate as the next imaging study for adults with acute hand or wrist trauma when initial radiographs are 
negative or equivocal. These procedures are equivalent alternatives.  
• Variant 3: MR arthrography of wrist, MRI of wrist wit hout IV contrast, CT arthrography of wrist, or US  of 
wrist  is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for adults with suspected wrist tendon or ligament 
trauma and when radiographs show acute wrist fracture. These procedures are equivalent alternativ es. 
• Variant 4: CT of both wrists without IV contrast, MRI of wrist without IV contrast, or MR arthrography of 
wrist is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for adults when initial radiographs shows distal 
radioulnar joint or carpal malalignment in  the absence of fracture. These procedures are equivalent 
alternatives.  
• Variant 5: MRI of hand without IV contrast or US of hand is usually appropriate as the next imaging study 
for adults with suspect hand tendon or ligament trauma and when radiographs show acute hand fracture. 
These procedures are equivalent alternatives.

With or without prior injury. Best initial study.  
Radiographs  
While there is no recent literature that directly addresses the role of first-line examinations for chronic wrist pain, 
radiographs are usually  appropriate as an initial study. Radiographs are widely available , and for many bone, 
joint, and alignment abnormalities, radiographs alone are diagnostic. In other patients, nonspecific radiologic findings (including those in the soft  tissues) combined with the history and physical examination may be 
sufficient for clinical diagnosis, or may suggest preferred secondary imaging studies.  
MRI  
MRI is no t routinely used in the initial evaluation of chronic wrist pain.

ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 5 Acute Hand and Wrist Trauma  Most fractures of the thumb are visible on a 2-view radiographic examination, although there is a slight increase 
in dia gnostic yield with the addition of an oblique projection [ 13], which can be obtained along with a PA 
examination of the whole hand.  
In patients with suspected finger tendon injuries, radiographs are used to detect fracture fragments, as large 
fragments may require open reduction and internal fixation.  Radiographs are usually sufficient for  the evaluation 
of osseous “mallet” injuries, which include bony avulsion at the insertion of the extensor mechanism of the finger 
to the distal interphalangeal joint [16]. In these injuries, involvement of more than one -third of the articular 
surface usually requires operative fixation.  Palmar displacement of the distal phalanx or an interfragmentary gap 
of >3 mm is also an indication for surgery [ 16]. With extensor tendon injuries, radiographs are commonly used to 
assess for bone involve ment and determine need for operative fixation [ 17]. 
CT Area of Interest  
In patients with intra -articular fractures seen on radiography , CT shows articular fracture fragment displacement, 
depression, and comminution more accurately than conventional radiographs [ 7,9,10]. CT measurements of 
articular surface gap and step -off are more reproducible than radiographs [7]. The addition of 3- D surface -
rendered reconstructions to the standard 2 -D CT images has been shown to change operative management in up to 
48% of intra -articular distal radius fractures [8]. 
There is no evidence to support the use of CT with intravenous  (IV) contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist 
trauma.

ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 6 Acute Hand and Wrist Trauma  Like CT, MRI shows intra -articular extension of distal radius fractures more frequently than radiography.  Unlike 
CT, MRI shows concomitant ligament  injuries, including tears of the scapholunate ligament, which may affect 
surgical treatment [26,27]. Despite these advantages,  MRI performed immediately at the time of injury has little 
added value for determining which patients go on to surgery [ 23]. 
MRI is especially useful in evaluating  hand soft -tissues injuries, including the collateral ligaments, volar plates, 
tendons, and pulleys. For metacarpal and digital fractures, MRI is usually not indicated during acute injury [ 22]. 
There is no evidence to support the use of MRI with IV contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist trauma.  
US Area of Interest  
US may have a limited utility  for evaluating bone injuries. Christiansen et al  [28] reported 47% sensitivity and 
61% specificity of US  for the detection of scaphoid fractures . They concluded that US  is not suitable for the early 
diagnosis of scaphoid fracture.  In contrast, Hauger et al  [29] reported that using cortical disruption as a diagnostic 
criterion on US is an accurate sign for detecting occult fractures of the scaphoid waist. Further study of US  for the 
diagnosis of occult fractures is needed . 
Bone Scan Area of  Interest  
Bone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  
Variant 3: Acute wrist fracture on radiographs. Suspect wrist tendon or ligament trauma. Next imaging 
study. 
Radiography Wrist  
Assessment of carpal instability with conventional radiographs requires careful attention to radiographic 
positioning.  In low -grade injuries, radiographs are usually normal.  Scapholunate diastasis of >4 mm and dorsal til t 
of the lunate of > 10° suggests dorsal intercalated segmental instability  [30,31].

CT Area of Interest  
CT has high sensitivity for detection of radiopaque foreign bodies [77, 78]. In case of penetration of foreign body 
into deep tissues or bone, CT is recommended [ 79]. 
There are no studies of the hand and wrist. For comparabl e studies regarding  foreign bodies in the feet, CT has 
63% sensitivity and 98% specificity.  CT detection rates depend on the attenuation values of the foreign bodies.  
CT is superior to MRI in identifying water -rich fresh wood [ 80]. 
MRI Area of Interest  
MRI has lower sensitivity compared to CT for detection of foreign bodies [ 78,79]. 
For foreign bodies in the feet, MRI has 58% sensitivity and 100% spe cificity. MRI detection rates depend on the 
associated susceptibility artifact [ 80]. There are no comparable studies of the hand and wrist.  
MRI may be useful in certain circumstances,  such as with complicated foreign bodies.  MRI helps identify foreign 
bodies by the presence of air or metal susceptib ility artifact or adjacent edema or fibrosis.  MRI may also be used 
to exclude associated osteomyelitis (see the ACR Appropriateness Criteria® topic on “ Suspected Osteomyelitis, 
Septic Arthritis, or Soft Tissue Infection (Excluding Spine and Diabetic Foot) ” [81]) or abscess [77]. 
In cases of s uspected traumatic nerve injury of the hand and wrist, MRI with dedicated neu rography sequences 
(eg, diffusion  weighted) ha s shown improved visualization of the injured nerves  [82].

punch depression, or more than three articular fracture fragments are common indications for operative reduction 
[8]. Operative fixation resulting in < 2 mm of residual articular surface step-off is usually considered necessary to 
avoid long-term complications , such as osteoarthritis [9 ,12].

Radiograph y Area of Interest  
Radiography is  always indicated as the initial imaging for suspected acute hand and wrist trauma.  For m ost joints 
of the extremities, especially those involving the wrist, hand, and fingers, a radiographic examination that 
includes only 2 views is not adequate for detecting fractures [13]. For patients with suspected  distal radius 
fractures, a 3-view examination  of the wrist  usually includes a posteroanterior (PA) , a lateral, and a 45° 
semi pronated oblique view  [11]. One study [ 14] reports that a fourth projection—a semisupinated oblique —
increases diagnostic yield for distal radius fractures.  
A standard 3 -view radiographic examination of the hand shows most fractures and dislocations of the metacarpals 
and phalanges [ 13]. For phalangeal injuries, some centers include a PA examination of the entire hand, whereas 
others limit the examination to the injured finger.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Hand injuries account for approximately 20% of emergency department visits [ 1]. According to the National 
Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey , 1.5% of all emergency department visits involve  hand and wrist 
fractu res. Distal radius fractures are especially common, accounting for up to 18% of fractures in the elderly [ 2,3]. 
Because of increasing rates of osteoporosis, the incidence of distal radius fractures has been increasing [ 4]. 
Although most distal radius fractures in e lderly patients are managed non operatively, the use of internal fixation is 
increasing. Internal fixation has a much higher cost than nonopera tive treatment as well as increased rates of 
hospitalization [5]. 
For most patients with trauma to the hand and wrist, conventional radiographs provide sufficient diagnostic 
information to guide the treating physician.  However, delayed diagnosis is common because distal radius and 
scaphoid fractures may be radiographically occult  [6]. When initial radiographs  are normal but there is high 
clinical suspicion for fracture, further imaging with additional radiographic pr ojections, CT, or MRI  is 
appropriate .

Introduction/Background 
Chronic  hip pain is a common chief  complaint  for patients , reportedly affecting  30% to 40% of adults  who play 
sports  [1,2] , and 12% to 15% of all adults  over 60 [3,4] . A wide variety  of pathological  entities  may cause hip pain, 
including  osseous  as well as intra- or extra -articular  soft tissue abnormalities  [5-7]. Pathology  involving  the lumbar  
spine,  sacroiliac,  or knee  joints  can also cause hip pain [8], and these  etiologies  should  be investigated  as needed . 
There is limited  original  research  that specifically  targets the imaging  of chronic  hip pain,  but imaging  of specific  
conditions  is widely  discussed  in the published  literature. 
Before  imaging,  an appropriate  assessment  of a patient’s  clinical  history  and physical  examination  is essential  in 
trying  to pare down the range  of possible etiologies  for a patient’s  symptoms.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Fractures of the proximal femur (commonly referred to as hip fractures)  are a frequent  source of morbidity and 
mortality in elderly osteoporotic patients [1]. Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type 
result in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men 
[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs 
will continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of 
life following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays 
in diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -
and long-term mortality [6-13]. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of hip fractures is critical. Hip fractures 
cannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded on the basis of physical exam ination  alone ; therefore , imaging plays a 
key role in early  and accurate diagnosis [14] .

Findings  on pelvic  radiographs  can result  in an imaging  diagnosis  such as 
osteoarthritis  or may lead to more  advanced  workups  of less common  causes of chronic  hip pain such as primary  
bone  tumors.  The results of the pelvic  radiograph can help the clinician  for the selection  of additional  imaging  
techniques  and for comparison  with studies such as MRI,  CT, radionuclide  bone  scans,  and fluoride  PET [13-15].

The biomechanics of proximal femoral and pelvic fractures that are a result of major trauma differs as these 
injuries may be seen in any age group, often with additional accompanying high-velocity injuri es of the abdomen 
and pelvis . Motor vehicle –related trauma is the most common  mechanism. Thorough evaluation of the hip may be 
superseded  in these instances by the need for resuscitation and diagnosis and treatment of more urgent associated 
vascular or solid organ injuries. Imaging plays an important role not only in the diagnosis of high-velocity 
fractures but also in characterizing fracture mechanism and morphology for treatment planning purposes.  
However, imaging of high-velocity hip fractures occurs in the context of a broader trauma evaluation. A full 
discussion of the broader imaging workup of blunt trauma is beyond the scope of this paper and will be covered in 
the upcoming ACR Appropriateness Criteria® titled “Major Blunt Trauma” and will be made available on the 
ACR website  when completed . 
Treatment  for both intra - and extracapsular proximal femoral fractures in the elderly is typically surgical fixation  
because of the risk of further fracture displacement and the dangers of prolonged immobilization in the elderly 
[15]. Joint replacement may be  performed for displaced fractures of the femoral neck where the risk of femoral 
head avascular necrosis is high. Fractures from high -force trauma are also commonly treated with surgical 
fixation for stability to reduce the risk of post -traumatic osteo arthritis. 
Discussion of Procedures by Variant  
Variant 1:  Acute hip pain. Fall or minor trauma. Suspect fracture. Initial imaging.  
Radiography Hip 
Radiography is the initial imaging modality of choice for assessment of acute hip pain with suspected fracture , 
with the more advanced imaging modalities reserved for instances of clinically suspected fracture in the setting of 
negative or equivocal radiographs. Radiographs are rapidly obtained and well tolerated by patients. When a 
fracture is demonstrated , freque ntly no more imaging is needed for treatment planning purposes [15 -17].

Altho ugh the technology holds promise, diagnostic accuracy does not yet 
approach that of MRI , with an  initial study by Reddy et al [49] demonstrating a sensitivity of 90% and specificity 
of 40% for nondisplaced femoral neck fractures . However, this may be a modality of emerging imp ortance as 
technology improves.  
US Hip 
The use of US  for evaluation of the acutely painful hip has been evaluated in a single study of 10 patients  with hip 
fractures [36]. Although US was able to identify trauma-related changes,  such as joint effusion , with 100% 
sensitivity , specificity for fracture reached only 65%. The authors acknowledged that performance might further 
decrease for examinations performed by sonographers and radiologists not experienced with musculoskeletal US . 
For this document , it is assumed the procedure is performed and interpreted by an expert.  Given the inability of 
US to comprehensively evaluate the bones and soft  tissues of the pelvis, there is not enough evidence to support 
the role of US  in the workup of radiographically occult hip fracture.

Special Imaging Considerations  
Avoidance of manipulation of the  ankle prior to radiographs in the absence of neurovascular deficit or critical skin 
injury is recommended in order to avoid remanipulation or complication in this setting [27].  Advances in MRI 
technology have facilitated short dedicated extremity MRI protocols in so me centers that may be used as an 
emergent adjunct to radiographs  [28]. 
Initial Imaging Definition 
Imaging at the beginning of the care episode for the medical condition defined by the variant. More than one 
procedure can be considered usually appropriate in the initial imaging evaluation when:  
• There are procedures that are equivalent alternatives (ie,  only one procedure will be ordered to 
provide the clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care)  
OR 
• There are complementary procedures (ie, more than one procedure is ordered as a set or 
simultaneously in which  each procedure provides uniq ue clinical information to effectively manage 
the patient’s care).

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Ankle pain is considered chronic when symptoms persist > 6 weeks. Chronic ankle  pain can be caused by a variety 
of osseous or soft -tissue abnormalities, either alone or in combination. For assessing chronic ankle pain, there are 
multiple imaging options, including radiography, stress radiography,  computed tomography (CT)  radionuclide 
bone scanning, ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and various injection procedures. Injection 
proce dures include arthrography, CT arthrography, MR arthrography, and diagnostic injection with anesthetic 
agents. Although there are numerous causes for chronic ankle pain, common etiologies include osteoarthritis, 
osteochondral injury, tendon abnormalities, ligament abnormalities and instability, and impingement.  
Overview of Imaging Modalities  
Radiography Radiographs can provide information about the osseous and soft -tissue structures about the ankle. Routine 
radiographs of the ankle typically include anteroposterior, lateral, and mortise views, the latter obtained by internally rotating the foot 15 to 20 degrees.

Stress views are not routinely used for the evaluation of suspected tendon abnormality.  
Variant 5: Chronic ankle pain. Ankle radiographs normal or nonspecific, suspected ankle instability. Next study . 
In the absence of findings on routine radiography, imaging options to evaluate ligamentous integrity include stress radiography, MRI, MR arthrography, CT arthrography, and US.  
MRI  
One study eva luating anterior talofibular ligament injury demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy of 97% for MRI 
when compared to arthroscopic findings. Additionally, MRI identified the exact location of the injury in 93% of 
the cases [15].  Comparing MRI with arthroscopy, studies have shown a range of accuracies of chronic lateral 
ligament tearing (either partial or complete), ranging from 77 % to 92% for the anterior talofibular ligament and 
88% to 92% for the calcaneofibular ligament [14, 52]. For the evaluation of deep deltoid ligament tears, MRI is 
both sensitive and specific compared with arthroscopy, with reported values of 96% and 98%, respectively [53].  
With regard to tears of the tibiofibular ligaments of the tibiofibular syndesmosis, MRI has a reported accuracy of 100% [54]. Additionally, MRI can also demonstrate interosseous membrane tears [55]. MRI offers the advantage 
of evaluating for injuries associated with or mimicking lateral instability that may not be diagnosed on stress radiography such as tenosynovitis, tendon injury, and osteochondral lesions [56]. MRI may also be used to evaluate the ankle after lateral ligament reconstruction [57].  
MR Arthrography  
MR arthrography can be helpful for the assessment of chronic ankle instability due to lateral collateral ligament injuries [12].  
US 
One study evaluating anterior talofibular ligamen t injury demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy of 91% for US when 
compared to arthroscopic findings.

MRI Ankle  
MRI is the reference standard for ligamentous injury and assessment of stability , which is particularly important in 
athletes, in whom determination of grade (1, 2,  or 3) of syndesmotic ligament, anterior tibiofibular ligament , and 
deltoid injuries is critica l for treatment planning and return to sport assessment [51] . 
Ligamentous injuries can occur without fracture on radiography. Grossterlinden et al  [52] compared MRI and 
radiography and showed that 15% of ligamentous injuries (including sprains, partial tears, and complete tears) at 
the syndesmosis in acute ankle injuries on M RI demonstra ted no fracture on radiography.  
Rare pantalar dislocations without associated talar or other fracture can be assessed on CT or MRI and have high 
rates of osteonecrosis, osteoarthritis, and infection  [71]. 
Radiography Ankle Stress Views  
Stress radiograph s may be useful in assessing syndesmotic instability, particularly in supination external rotation 
ankle injuries according to the Lauge -Hansen classification. Lee et al [72]  noted that tibiotalar tilt angle and anterior 
tibiofibular space measurements were affected when the anterior tibiofibular and posterior talofibular ligaments 
were injured (confirmed on MRI) in 299 patients . Lateral stress testing with widening of the tibiofibular clear space 
has been shown to be  an indicator of syndesmotic injury , with the traditional external rotation stress test shown to 
be a poor indicator when t he deltoid ligament is injured [73] .

be followed by CT  and MR I [60,61] . These lesions are treated successfully with combined open approach and 
arthroscop y. 
Fractures  
CT is the first -line imaging  study  after radiographs to determine extent, displacement , comminution, intra -articular 
extension , associated injuries,  and potential classification of fractures [48] . This is particularly important in subtalar, 
calcaneal,  and talar fractures because of  the complex anatomy and in high -impact polytrauma or complex 
comminuted injuries in which multiplanar CT imaging is recommended to help direct the preoperative planning 
evaluation process [62]. 
MRI Ankle  
Osteochondral lesions  
MRI without  IV contrast is co nsidered the study of choice for assessment of cartilage abnormalities and bone 
contusions related to acquired  osteochondral lesion,  particularly in patients with symptoms of persistent pain, 
stiffness, locking, clicking , and ankle swelling  [22,55-57,63] . Although radiographs and CT depict ossific fragments 
and fracture lines, cartilage abnormalities and bone contusions related to osteochondral lesion are best seen on MRI. 
Seventy percent  of ankle fractures and 50% of ankle sprains have been shown to result in some variation of cartilage 
injury [57,58,61,64] . 
Fractures  
Although CT is more commonly used as the next step in fracture assessment in  known fractures, MRI can be useful 
as a follow-up imaging modality for assessment of associated bone marrow contusions, stress injuries,  or fractures 
[65]. MRI is especially important in fracture sites such as the talus,  which are at higher risk for osteonecrosis. MR I 
is highly accurate for associated soft -tissue abnormalities including tendon entrapment/dislocation and for 
ligamentous inju ries [66].

Radiograph y Foot  
Radiographs  are indicated  by positive  Ottawa rules with 99% sensitivity  in determining  the presence of a foot 
fracture  [1,9,10] . Radiographs  are the mainstay  of initial imaging in the setting  of acute foot trauma.  Initial  
imaging typically  consists of a 3-view study  with the possibility  of additional  views as indicated  by the clinical  
setting  [8]. Additional  views,  such as axial  calcaneal  view,  can be useful  in patients  with suspected  calcaneal  
fracture  [15] because addition of this view  increases specificity  in diagnosing calcaneal  fractures  and sensitivity  in 
distinguishing intra-articular  calcaneal  fractures.  
Lisfranc  Injury  
When  there is a fairly  high clinical  suspicion  of an acute Lisfranc injury,  the foot should be imaged.  In addition  to 
a typical  3-view  radiographic  study  of the foot (anteroposterior  [AP],  oblique,  and lateral),  an AP view with 20° 
craniocaudal  angulation can be added  [16,17] . Although patients  with Lisfra nc sprains may incur  ligamentous  
damage  without  diastasis [18], radiography  should be the initial imaging modality  in the setting  of a suspected  
Lisfranc injury.

Introduction/Background 
Acute injuries  to the foot are frequently  encountered  in the setting  of the emergency  room  and in general  practice.  
The clinical  indications  for imaging  (known as the Ottawa rules)  have  been  developed  to minimize  unnecessary  
radiographs , and their utility  is well documented by multiple  studies.  The most  commonly  accepted  form  of these  
rules is the following:  
A series of foot radiographs  is required  only if there  is pain in the midfoot  and any one of the 
following:  1) point  bone  tenderness of the navicular;  2) point  bone  tenderness of the base of the fifth 
metatarsal;  or 3) inability  to bear weight  or to walk  4 steps (immediately  after the injury  or at the 
emergency  department) .

Patellofemoral car tilage loss is also associated with chronic knee pain , with active knee pain correlated with 
BMLs [30,31]. Similar to CT, MRI can calculate various anatomic measurements associated with patellofemoral 
subluxation/dislocation and lateral patellofemoral friction syndrome [32-34]. Bone marrow edema in the classic 
location for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also 
differentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise 
therapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. 
Other etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat 
pad impingement syndromes, Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome, adhesive 
capsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes , 
and osteonecrosis [15, 19,36-45].  
MRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a 
joint effusion. However, contrast -enhanced images ma y be more accurate in diagnosing other causes of chronic 
knee pain , such as Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome, and adhesive 
capsulitis [15].  In particular, enh ancing synovitis thicker than 2 mm in Hoffa’s fat is correlated with peripatellar 
pain [46]. Contrast -enhanced MRI is also useful in quantifying the degree of synovitis and in evaluating 
conditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis [ 17,42,47,48].

cervical trauma and constitute a spectrum of cervical sp ine injuries commonly referred to as whiplash associated

notably the paraspinal muscles, facets,  discs, and craniocervical ligaments [85- 91]. However, the exact etiology of

origin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. 
Subchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed 
spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to 
elderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs 
often initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, 
and progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is 
suspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria

There are not, as yet, established criteria for distinguishing significant from inconsequential apparent 
abnormalities on MRI. In the absence of proven guidelin es, many physicians use through-and-through tears of 
ligaments as indicating definite mechanical failure, with lesser evidence of injury, such as simple high signal on 
T2-weighted images, being considered ambiguous [83]. Thes e less specific findings tend to be incorporated with 
clinical findings, evidence of subluxation and other imag ing findings, mechanism of injury, and likelihood of the 
patient’s successful compliance with conservative treatment. 
MRI is superior to CT in identifying cervical spine liga ment injuries. However, ligam ent injuries that are occult 
on CT and identified on MRI rarely result in significant changes in clinical management. Studies looking at 
presence of soft-tissue injury on cervical spine MRI in patients with unreliable examination and negative CT have 
found MRI to be positive in 6% to 49% of patients [ 41,44,45,47,48,78]. Most of these injuries were minor, 
requiring either no change in manageme nt or only extended cervical collar placement. Less than 1% of patients 
with unreliable clinical examination and negative cervical  spine CT will have an unstable cervical spine injury 
requiring surgical stabilization identified on MRI [38-41,44-48,78-80].

Summary of Literature Review  
Background/Introduction 
Chronic knee pain affects tens of millions of people  in the United States annually , with the pain sometimes highly 
disabling and often negatively impacting the patient’s quality of life. Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and 
it can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain 
with the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. 
Typically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain 
persists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  
imaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated 
that approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the 
prior year) radiographs [2 ]. 
This document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  ≥5 years of age.

Patellofemoral car tilage loss is also associated with chronic knee pain , with active knee pain correlated with 
BMLs [30,31]. Similar to CT, MRI can calculate various anatomic measurements associated with patellofemoral 
subluxation/dislocation and lateral patellofemoral friction syndrome [32-34]. Bone marrow edema in the classic 
location for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also 
differentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise 
therapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. 
Other etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat 
pad impingement syndromes, Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome, adhesive 
capsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes , 
and osteonecrosis [15, 19,36-45].  
MRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a 
joint effusion. However, contrast -enhanced images ma y be more accurate in diagnosing other causes of chronic 
knee pain , such as Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome, and adhesive 
capsulitis [15].  In particular, enh ancing synovitis thicker than 2 mm in Hoffa’s fat is correlated with peripatellar 
pain [46]. Contrast -enhanced MRI is also useful in quantifying the degree of synovitis and in evaluating 
conditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis [ 17,42,47,48].

The 
variants discussed include: (1) initial exam ination ; (2) initial radiograph is normal or demonstrates a joint 
effusion; (3) initial radiogr aph demonstrates osteochondritis dissecans (OCD), loose bodies or history of cartilage,  
or meniscal repair; (4) initial radiograph demonstrates osteoarthritis or chondrocalcinosis; and (5)  initial 
radiograph demonstrates signs of prior (chronic) knee injur y (ie, Segond fract ure, tibial spine avulsion, etc ).  
To evaluat e knee pain associated with other conditions, please refer to the following ACR Appropriateness 
Criteria® topic on:  “Osteonecrosi s of the Hip ” [3] for osteonecrosis,  “Acute Trauma to the Knee ” for acute knee 
injuries  [4], “Imaging After Total Knee Arthroplasty ” for patients with total knee arthroplasty  [5], “Soft-Tissue 
Masses ” for a patient with a suspected soft -tissue mass [6], “Primary Bone Tumors ” for a patient with a suspected 
or known bone tumor [ 7], and “ Chronic Extremity Joint Pain -Suspected Inflammatory Arthritis ” for patient with 
suspected arthritis  or synovitis [ 8]. 
Special Imaging  Considerations  
Knee radiographs  should include at least one frontal projection of one or both knees (anteroposterior, Rosenberg, 
or tunnel), a tangential patellar view , and a lateral view of the affected knee [2,9]. Standing radiographs more 
accurately reflect medial and lateral compartment cartilage loss than supine radiographs with the posteromedial and posterolateral joint compartments  more accurately assessed using a weight -bearing flexion posteroanterior 
radiograph [9,10].

ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 6 Acute  Trauma  to the Knee  Discussion  of Procedures  by Variant  
Variant  1: Adult  or child 5 years of age or older . Fall or acute  twisting  trauma  to the knee.  No focal  
tenderness,  no effusion, able to walk.  Initial imaging.  
CT Knee  
In the absence of focal  tenderness and joint effusion  in a patient  who is able to walk,  CT is not used as the initial  
imaging study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the knee.  
MR Arthrography  Knee  
MR arthrography  is not routinely  used as the initial imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the knee.  
MRA Knee  
MR angiography  (MRA ) is not routinely used as the initial imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the 
knee.  
MRI Knee  
MRI is not routinely  used as the initial imaging study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the knee.  
Radiography Knee  
With no clinical  symptoms  in the injured  knee , including lack of focal  tenderness and joint effusion , and with ability  
to walk,  knee  radiographs  may be indicated  if a patient  >55 years old per Ottawa rules or >50 years old or <12 years 
old per Pittsburgh  rule criteria [5, 6, 10]. If the patient  is between  5 and 12 years,  they fall outside  the age range  for 
both the Ottawa and Pittsburgh  rules and radiographs  may be beneficial  despite lack of clinical  symptoms.  
Radiographs  are commonly  performed  in the setting  of acute knee  injuries  but have  a low yield  for showing  
fractures.  In a retrospective review of 1,967 patients  with acute knee  injuries  by Stiell et al [2], 74.1%  of patients  
had knee  radiography,  and only 5.2%  of these had fractures.

With  negative radiographs,  CT may be performed  as the next imaging study  for the evaluation  of suspected  
radiographically  occult  knee  fractures  [12] and bone  marrow  contusions  [16-18]. CT may diagnose  or predict  
ligamentous  injuries  [14,15,50,51]  and predict  menisc al [15,50,51]  injuries. However,  MRI is superior  to CT in 
evaluation  of bone  marrow  lesions [27-29], meniscal  [21,26]  and ligamentous  [21,31-34]  injuries , and may be 
subsequently  performed  as clinically  indicated.

[42] with good performance  in the evaluation  of the meniscal  [44-46] and ligamentous  [47-49] injuries. However,  
the utility  of US in the evaluation  of the knee  menisci,  cruciate and collateral  ligaments , and periarticular  soft tissues

CT Knee  
In patients  with radiographic  diagnosis  of the tibial plateau  fracture,  CT is frequently  performed  for further

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Ankle pain is considered chronic when symptoms persist > 6 weeks. Chronic ankle  pain can be caused by a variety 
of osseous or soft -tissue abnormalities, either alone or in combination. For assessing chronic ankle pain, there are 
multiple imaging options, including radiography, stress radiography,  computed tomography (CT)  radionuclide 
bone scanning, ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and various injection procedures. Injection 
proce dures include arthrography, CT arthrography, MR arthrography, and diagnostic injection with anesthetic 
agents. Although there are numerous causes for chronic ankle pain, common etiologies include osteoarthritis, 
osteochondral injury, tendon abnormalities, ligament abnormalities and instability, and impingement.  
Overview of Imaging Modalities  
Radiography Radiographs can provide information about the osseous and soft -tissue structures about the ankle. Routine 
radiographs of the ankle typically include anteroposterior, lateral, and mortise views, the latter obtained by internally rotating the foot 15 to 20 degrees.

effusions may also be identified in the anterior ankle joint recess by radiography with 53% to 74% accuracy  [19]. 
They are often associated with ligamentous injury or fracture [19]. The presence of ossific fragments can indicate 
ligamentous injury or retinaculum avulsion [20], whereas periostitis can occur adjacent to tenosynovitis. 
Radiographs can also identify synovial osteochondromatosis and erosions from chronic synovitis.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic foot pain is a frequent clinical complaint with approximately 14% to 42% of adults in the United States 
reporting foot problems, often with significant impact on mobility, difficulty performing daily activities , and 
increased risk of falling, particularly in older individuals [1,2] . Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a 
significant improvement in health-related quality of life with effective treatment of foot pain [3] . Estimating the 
prevalence of chron ic foot pain is challenging, because there is no consensus regarding the definition of chronic 
pain in the literature. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines chronic pain as any pain persisting 
past the normal healing time, suggesting 3 months in case of chronic pain of benign causes.  
Women are more commonly affected , and forefoot conditions are more frequent. Persistent pain for more than 6  
years has been reported in 51% of women between 70 to 75 years of age [4]. Because of  the wide range of causes 
of chronic foot pain, assessment of these patients with imaging studies in addition to a dedicated clinical

US Ankle  
US is not typically the next line of evaluation  of syndesmotic injuries. Although some studies have suggested 
focused US could be beneficial for ligamentous evaluation, others have shown limited utility in lateral ankle 
ligament spr ains [75]. 
Summary of Recommendations  
Variant 1: Ankle radiographs are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of patients 5 years of age or older with 
acute trauma to the ankle or acute trauma to the ankle with persistent pain for more than 1 week but less than 3 
weeks with no exclusionar y criteria present and the OAR  are positive : 1. Inability to bear weight immediately after 
the injury, OR  2. Point tenderness over the medial malleolus, the posterior edge or inferior tip of the lateral 
malleolus, talus, or calcaneus, OR  3. Inability to ambulate for 4 steps in the emergency department.  
Variant 2: Imaging is usually not appropriate for patients 5 years of age or older with a cute trauma to the ankle 
when the patient is able  to walk  and there are no exclusionary criteria present (eg, neurologically intact (includ ing 
no peripheral neuropathy )) and  the OAR  are negative: No point tenderness over the malleoli, talus, or calcaneus on 
physical examination.  
Variant 3: Ankle radiographs are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of patients 5 ye ars of age or older  with 
acute trauma to the ankle when exclusionary criteria are present (eg, neurologic disorder, neuropathy, or other) and 
the patient does not meet requirements for evaluation by the OAR . 
Variant 4: MRI ankle without IV contrast or CT a nkle without IV contrast  are usually appropriate  for patients 5 
years of age or older with acute trauma to the ankle with persistent pain for more than 1 week but less than 3 weeks 
that had negative initial radiographs and no exclusionary criteria are present.

Radiography Ankle  
Repeat radiograph s are not typically the next study but may be of use to identify early callous formation at an occult 
fracture line or possible mineralization at a site of intramuscular hematoma if contusion occurred during trauma. 
Radiographs with better technique may assist in diagnosis of subtle injuries such as the lateral talar process avulsion , 
which  may erroneously be diagnosed as  a lateral ankle sprain  [37]. 
Radiography Ankle Stress Views  
Although ankle stress views are not the typical next best study for this patient group, if  there is clinical evidence of 
instability on physician maneuvers, ankle stress views may be of benefit for identification of occult avulsion injury 
at ligamentous attachments that may contribute t o widening of the joint spac e on radiographic stress views.  
US Ankle  
US is not typically  the next imaging study . US may be useful as a secondary evaluation modality for focuse d 
evaluation of underlying soft -tissue injuries  and ligaments, with the added benefit of dynamic imaging. This 
includes f ocused high-resolution US of the peroneal tendons and th e superior peroneal retinaculum  [56], stress US 
(during anterior drawer) to assess joint laxity or chondral avulsion fra ctures associated with lateral ligament injury 
in children with negative radiographs [57,58] , and potential detection of superficial occult fractures at the base of 
the fifth metatarsal, lateral malleolus,  and malleolus [41] . 
Variant  5: Adult or child 5 years of age or older. Acute trauma to the ankle. No exclusionary criteria present. 
Radiographs demonstrate fracture or potential osteochondral injury. Next study.  
Bone Scan Ankle  
Osteochondral lesions  
Bone scan is not the next imaging study in this clinical scenario.

Bone scan is not the next imaging study in this clinical scenario. Bone scan may be used in rare setting in polytrauma 
cases for evaluation of multiple fractures.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Ankle injuries are the most common injury presenting to primary care and emergency rooms [1,2] , accounting for 
4.4% of United States emergency room visits  [3]. Acute ankle sprains (pain, swelling, limited mobility) make up 
the majority of these injuries , with an estimated incidence of 2 million per year  [4]. Diagnosis of presence and 
degree of sprain, fracture, subluxation, dislocation, cartilage abnormalities, foreign bodies , or neurovascular 
involvement are critical in determining appropriate and timely orthopedic fixation/treatme nt planning [1,5] and to 
avoid chronic pain and immobility . Appropriate use of ankle imaging guidelines and clinical decision support 
mechanisms is paramount [6,7] . 
The current standard clinical imaging guidelines to determine if radiographs are necessary are the Ottawa Ankle 
Rules (OAR), instituted in 1992.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Ankle pain is considered chronic when symptoms persist > 6 weeks. Chronic ankle  pain can be caused by a variety 
of osseous or soft -tissue abnormalities, either alone or in combination. For assessing chronic ankle pain, there are 
multiple imaging options, including radiography, stress radiography,  computed tomography (CT)  radionuclide 
bone scanning, ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and various injection procedures. Injection 
proce dures include arthrography, CT arthrography, MR arthrography, and diagnostic injection with anesthetic 
agents. Although there are numerous causes for chronic ankle pain, common etiologies include osteoarthritis, 
osteochondral injury, tendon abnormalities, ligament abnormalities and instability, and impingement.  
Overview of Imaging Modalities  
Radiography Radiographs can provide information about the osseous and soft -tissue structures about the ankle. Routine 
radiographs of the ankle typically include anteroposterior, lateral, and mortise views, the latter obtained by internally rotating the foot 15 to 20 degrees.

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  elbow  pain is a common  patient  complaint  in the primary  care setting. Patients  may report  symptoms  of 
swelling,  pain,  restricted  range  of motion,  stiffness,  and numbness  or tingling  [1]. There is a wide  differential  
diagnosis  for chronic  elbow  pain, including osseous,  soft tissue,  cartil aginous , and nerve -related  abnormalities.  
Epicondylalgia , caused  by tendinosis  of the common  extensor  tendon laterally  (“tennis elbow”)  or medially  the 
common  flexor  tendon  (“golfer’s  elbow ”), is the most  common  cause of chronic  elbow  pain,  estimated  to occur in 
1% to 3% of the population  [2]. Epicondylalgia  is associated  with lost workdays  and a significant  economic  burden  
[3].

the trochlea [16]. 
MRI Elbow  
MRI elbow  may detect  loose  bodies,  and this is enhanced  in the presence of joint fluid.  Thus,  T2-weighted  images  
are recommended for the evaluation  of loose  bodies  in the elbow  [17]. MRI may also show  the presence of enlarged  
plica,  which  can result  in symptoms  of locking  and/or  pain with extension  [15]. MRI is often  suggested  as the initial  
study to assess for osteochondral  lesion  [12,17] . MRI  is less sensitive  than radiographs  in the detection  of 
heterotopic  ossification/calcification  [18]. Similar  to MR arthrography,  MRI elbow  is limited  in the evaluation  of 
cartilage defects [16]. 
US Elbow  
Although US may demonstrate  early -stage osteochondral  lesions and medial  epicondylar  fragmentation  [10], the 
details  of an osteochondral  lesion  are better  defined  by CT arthrography or MR arthrography.  Because of 
shadowing,  evaluation  of heterotopic  ossification  and loose  bodies  is limited  on US. 
Variant  3: Chronic  elbow  pain.  Suspect  occult  stress fracture or other bone  abnormality. Radiographs

3-Phase  Bone  Scan  Elbow  
Bone  scan is extremely  sensitiv e for detection  of stress fractures  and trauma  related  fractures [19-21] . 
Radiopharmaceutical  uptake  occurs in areas  of active bone  turnover , and thus, imaging  may be positive  in the 
presymptomatic  stage of stress injuries  [20].

MRI has high inter- and intraobserver  reliability  for the diagnosi s of epicondylalgia  [26]. It also has a sensitivity  of 
90% to 100%  and a specificity  of 83% to 100%  [27]. The most  specific findings  of medial  epicondylalgia  include  
interm ediate to high T2 signal  or high T2 signal  within  the common  flexor  tendon  and paratendinous  soft tissue  
edema [28]. MRI has the benefit  of demonstrating associated  findings  in epicondylalgia , including radial  collateral  
and lateral  UCL  injuries  [26]. MRI may also facilitate  surgical  planning [29]. 
MRI is useful  for the diagnosis  of biceps  tendon injury.  Sensitivity  and specificity  are reported  at 92.4%  and 100%,  
respectively,  in detecting  distal  biceps tendon  ruptures  and 59.1%  and 100%,  respectively  for partial  tears [30]. 
US Elbow  
US elbow  has moderate agreement  with MR elbow  for the diagnosis  and grading of common  extensor  tendon tears.  
US sensitivity, specificity,  and accuracy  are reported  at 64.25%,  85.19%,  and 72.73% , respectively  [31]. Recently,  
sonoelastography  has shown more  promising outcomes for detection  of medial  epicondylalgia  with a sensitivity,

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  elbow  pain is a common  patient  complaint  in the primary  care setting. Patients  may report  symptoms  of 
swelling,  pain,  restricted  range  of motion,  stiffness,  and numbness  or tingling  [1]. There is a wide  differential  
diagnosis  for chronic  elbow  pain, including osseous,  soft tissue,  cartil aginous , and nerve -related  abnormalities.  
Epicondylalgia , caused  by tendinosis  of the common  extensor  tendon laterally  (“tennis elbow”)  or medially  the 
common  flexor  tendon  (“golfer’s  elbow ”), is the most  common  cause of chronic  elbow  pain,  estimated  to occur in 
1% to 3% of the population  [2]. Epicondylalgia  is associated  with lost workdays  and a significant  economic  burden  
[3].

the trochlea [16]. 
MRI Elbow  
MRI elbow  may detect  loose  bodies,  and this is enhanced  in the presence of joint fluid.  Thus,  T2-weighted  images  
are recommended for the evaluation  of loose  bodies  in the elbow  [17]. MRI may also show  the presence of enlarged  
plica,  which  can result  in symptoms  of locking  and/or  pain with extension  [15]. MRI is often  suggested  as the initial  
study to assess for osteochondral  lesion  [12,17] . MRI  is less sensitive  than radiographs  in the detection  of 
heterotopic  ossification/calcification  [18]. Similar  to MR arthrography,  MRI elbow  is limited  in the evaluation  of 
cartilage defects [16]. 
US Elbow  
Although US may demonstrate  early -stage osteochondral  lesions and medial  epicondylar  fragmentation  [10], the 
details  of an osteochondral  lesion  are better  defined  by CT arthrography or MR arthrography.  Because of 
shadowing,  evaluation  of heterotopic  ossification  and loose  bodies  is limited  on US. 
Variant  3: Chronic  elbow  pain.  Suspect  occult  stress fracture or other bone  abnormality. Radiographs  
normal  or nonspecific . Next  imaging  study. 
3-Phase  Bone  Scan  Elbow  
Bone  scan is extremely  sensitiv e for detection  of stress fractures  and trauma  related  fractures [19-21] . 
Radiopharmaceutical  uptake  occurs in areas  of active bone  turnover , and thus, imaging  may be positive  in the 
presymptomatic  stage of stress injuries  [20].

Bone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the 
subchondral bone.  New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or 
patients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee 
pain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the 
origin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. 
Subchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed 
spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to 
elderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs 
often initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, 
and progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is 
suspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria
® 
topic on “ Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae ” [28]. 
Some patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using 
quantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs 
exhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ].

Once a scaphoid fracture is identified, Radiographic arthrography does not contribute to the evaluation for 
complications of the fracture.  
Variant 12: Chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or nonspecific. Suspect carpal tunnel syndrome.  Next 
study. 
US Wrist 
Several meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the 
carpal  tunnel  inlet) is highly accurate for identifying carpal  tunnel syndrome  diagnosed clinically or with the 
combination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US 
varies depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the 
measurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary 
examination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel 
syndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal 
tunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, 
clinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of 
carpal tunnel syndrome. US may be appropriate in cases where this initial evaluation is equivocal.  
MRI Wrist  
Historically, carpal tunnel syndrome has been diagnosed based on clinical signs and sympt oms and confirmed by 
the results of electrodiagnostic studies [67]. MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in cases in which this  
initial evaluation is equivocal. The MRI findings that have been reported in wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome —
including nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing—may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value 
in patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68].

Score: 0.6634537839998885","condition: chronic hand and wrist pain

In rare cases of secondary carpal tunnel syndrome, MRI may identify 
a mass lesion compressing the median nerve. There is some evidence that the length of T2 hyperintensity in the 
median nerve can help prognosticate the success of surgery [69] and that the shape and signal of the nerve predict 
clinical response to a steroid injection in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome [70 ]. MR neurography 
may be an option in patients with suspected carpal tunnel syndrome.  The use o f IV contrast does not contribute to 
diagnosis and is usually not appropriate.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
MR arthrography is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.  
CT Wrist  
CT, with or without IV  contrast, is not routinely used to diagnose carpa l tunnel syndrome.  
CT Arthrography  Wrist  
CT arthrography is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.  
Bone Scan  Wrist  
Bone scan is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.  
Arthrography  Wrist

Summary of Recommendations  
• Wrist radiographs are indicated as the best initial imaging examination in patients with chronic wrist pain. 
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal and a patient has persistent symptoms wi th an unclear diagnosis, 
MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate.  
• In patients with suspected inflammatory arthritis, MRI either with or without IV contrast is usually 
appropriate if guidance for management or prognostication is needed.  
• Patients with  suspected wrist infection should undergo aspiration.  
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal in a patient with ulnar -sided pain, either MRI without IV contrast 
or an MR arthrogram of the wrist is usually appropriate.  
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal in a patient with radial -sided pain, MRI without IV contrast is 
usually appropriate.

ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 8 Acute Hand and Wrist Trauma  MRI Hand  
MRI is ideal for evaluating tendon injuries and helping with surgical planning [58, 59]. MRI is comm only used for 
the diagnosis of  Stener lesions of the thumb [60] and the diagnosis of pulley system injuries [61]. 
Hergan et al [62] reported a 100% sensitivity and specificity for assessment of thumb ulnar collateral ligament 
tears. Spaeth et al [ 63] reported a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 94% for detection of displaced ulnar 
collateral ligament tears in 16 cadaveric specimens.  
US Hand  
A Stener lesion occurs when the aponeurosis of the adductor pollicis muscle becomes interposed between the 
ruptured ulnar collateral ligament of the thumb and its site  of insertion at the base of the proximal phalanx. This 
lesion can be identified by absence of ulnar collateral ligament and the presence of a hypoechoic mass proximal to 
the apex of the metacarpal tubercle [64]. Dynamic examination shows the relationship of the aponeurosis to the 
retracted ligament stump [65] . 
US allows for diagnosis of pulley system injuries [ 66,67]. 
Bone Scan Hand 
Bone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  
Variant 6: Initial radiographs showing metaca rpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, or distal

These factors make CT the 
preferred examination for suspected distal radioulnar joint subluxation, where images of both wrists can be  
obtained in both supination and pronation [1 ,13]. A disadvantage of CT  is its lower sensitivity to soft -tissue 
abnormalities  compared with MRI.  
High-resolution (typically multidetector) CT of the wrist following contrast injection into one or more wrist 
compartments (CT arthrography) is a powerful tool for diagnosing intra -articular abnormalities [14,15]. The 
intraobserver agreement on CT arthrogram images is extremely high and better than that reported for MRI 
[14,16]. 
US 
US of the wrist is useful for examining extra -articular soft tissues, such as suspected ganglion cyst s [17], because 
its accuracy is similar to that of MRI. US can also be used to diagnose abnormalities of the flexor and extensor 
tendons and tendon sheaths. For de Quervain disease (stenosing tenosynovitis of the abductor pollicis lon gus and 
extensor pollicis brevis tendon compartment), preoperative identification of a septum or subcompartmentalization 
within the first dorsal compartment with US  may affect surgical management [18 ,19]. 
In patients with suspected or established rheumatoid arthritis (RA), US examination of the wrist and selected 
finger joints can identify erosions and active synovit is (with the use of power Doppler), findings that influence 
early diagnosis and treatment decisions [20]. Using US to measure the size of the median nerve is a  validated  
technique in patients with clinical symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome [21-24].  
In addition, w rist US is a useful technique to guide therapeutic intr a-articular and other soft -tissue injections [25].

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic foot pain is a frequent clinical complaint with approximately 14% to 42% of adults in the United States 
reporting foot problems, often with significant impact on mobility, difficulty performing daily activities , and 
increased risk of falling, particularly in older individuals [1,2] . Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a 
significant improvement in health-related quality of life with effective treatment of foot pain [3] . Estimating the 
prevalence of chron ic foot pain is challenging, because there is no consensus regarding the definition of chronic 
pain in the literature. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines chronic pain as any pain persisting 
past the normal healing time, suggesting 3 months in case of chronic pain of benign causes.  
Women are more commonly affected , and forefoot conditions are more frequent. Persistent pain for more than 6  
years has been reported in 51% of women between 70 to 75 years of age [4]. Because of  the wide range of causes 
of chronic foot pain, assessment of these patients with imaging studies in addition to a dedicated clinical 
examination is often needed [1] .

Bone Scan Foot  
Planar b one scintigraphy has low anatomic resolution and has been shown to be a nonspecific technique to assess 
the hallucal sesamoids [24]. However, bone scintigraphy with single -photon emission computed tomography 
(SPECT)/CT increases contrast resolution and anatomic localization of foci with increased osteoblastic activity  
[25]. Bone scintigraphy may demonstrate increased uptake in pathologic conditions affecting the fir st metatarsal 
sesamoids not evident on radiographs. A less dramatic uptake is noted in stress fractures, which may be helpful to 
differentiate between them and acute fractures [26]. When an indeter minate linear lucency is visualized on 
radiographs, a negative bone scintigraphy suggest s sesamoid bipartition [12] . Other conditions that may present 
positive findings on Tc -99m -methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scint igraphy include sesamoiditis, 
inflammatory or deposition arthropathies, osteoarthritis , and osteonecrosis [39]. In Freiberg’s infraction, a 
photopenic center with a hyperactive collar may be identified on early stages on high -resolution Tc -99m -MDP bone 
scintigraphy [27].

Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  
usually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, 
osteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite 
versus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess 
with radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton’s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other 
causes of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg’s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals 
or soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . 
Though radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in 
patients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic foot pain is a frequent clinical complaint with approximately 14% to 42% of adults in the United States 
reporting foot problems, often with significant impact on mobility, difficulty performing daily activities , and 
increased risk of falling, particularly in older individuals [1,2] . Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a 
significant improvement in health-related quality of life with effective treatment of foot pain [3] . Estimating the 
prevalence of chron ic foot pain is challenging, because there is no consensus regarding the definition of chronic 
pain in the literature. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines chronic pain as any pain persisting 
past the normal healing time, suggesting 3 months in case of chronic pain of benign causes.  
Women are more commonly affected , and forefoot conditions are more frequent. Persistent pain for more than 6  
years has been reported in 51% of women between 70 to 75 years of age [4]. Because of  the wide range of causes 
of chronic foot pain, assessment of these patients with imaging studies in addition to a dedicated clinical 
examination is often needed [1] .

The guidelines of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons divide heel pain into plantar heel pain,  usually 
related to pathology of the plantar fascia, and posterior heel pain,  usually related to pathology of  the Achilles tendon, 
and treatment options vary from nonoperative treatments to surgical procedures [5] . 
Chronic foot pain in children, symptoms related to soft -tissue or bone neoplasms and pain related to infectious 
conditions, inflammatory arthropathies, or other systemic diseases are beyond the scope of this document. 
Evaluation of patients with neuropathic foot or Charcot arthropathy is addressed in the ACR Appropriateness

causes of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg’s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals 
or soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . 
Though radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in

Bone Scan Foot  
Planar b one scintigraphy has low anatomic resolution and has been shown to be a nonspecific technique to assess 
the hallucal sesamoids [24]. However, bone scintigraphy with single -photon emission computed tomography 
(SPECT)/CT increases contrast resolution and anatomic localization of foci with increased osteoblastic activity  
[25]. Bone scintigraphy may demonstrate increased uptake in pathologic conditions affecting the fir st metatarsal 
sesamoids not evident on radiographs. A less dramatic uptake is noted in stress fractures, which may be helpful to 
differentiate between them and acute fractures [26]. When an indeter minate linear lucency is visualized on 
radiographs, a negative bone scintigraphy suggest s sesamoid bipartition [12] . Other conditions that may present 
positive findings on Tc -99m -methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scint igraphy include sesamoiditis, 
inflammatory or deposition arthropathies, osteoarthritis , and osteonecrosis [39]. In Freiberg’s infraction, a 
photopenic center with a hyperactive collar may be identified on early stages on high -resolution Tc -99m -MDP bone 
scintigraphy [27].

Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  
usually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, 
osteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite 
versus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess 
with radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton’s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other 
causes of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg’s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals 
or soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . 
Though radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in 
patients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The 
combination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a 
specificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15].

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic foot pain is a frequent clinical complaint with approximately 14% to 42% of adults in the United States 
reporting foot problems, often with significant impact on mobility, difficulty performing daily activities , and 
increased risk of falling, particularly in older individuals [1,2] . Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a 
significant improvement in health-related quality of life with effective treatment of foot pain [3] . Estimating the 
prevalence of chron ic foot pain is challenging, because there is no consensus regarding the definition of chronic 
pain in the literature. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines chronic pain as any pain persisting 
past the normal healing time, suggesting 3 months in case of chronic pain of benign causes.  
Women are more commonly affected , and forefoot conditions are more frequent. Persistent pain for more than 6  
years has been reported in 51% of women between 70 to 75 years of age [4]. Because of  the wide range of causes 
of chronic foot pain, assessment of these patients with imaging studies in addition to a dedicated clinical 
examination is often needed [1] .

Although there is no relevant literature  to support the routine clinical use of US in the 
diagnosis of CRPS type II, high-resolu tion US may have a role giving its increasing use in nerve assessment [23] . 
Variant 3: Chronic metatarsalgia including plantar great toe pain. Radiographs negative or equivocal. 
Clinical concern includes sesamoiditis, Morton’s  neuroma, intermetatarsal bursitis, chronic plantar plate 
injury, or Freiberg’s infraction. Next imaging study.  
Bone Scan Foot  
Planar b one scintigraphy has low anatomic resolution and has been shown to be a nonspecific technique to assess 
the hallucal sesamoids [24]. However, bone scintigraphy with single -photon emission computed tomography 
(SPECT)/CT increases contrast resolution and anatomic localization of foci with increased osteoblastic activity  
[25]. Bone scintigraphy may demonstrate increased uptake in pathologic conditions affecting the fir st metatarsal 
sesamoids not evident on radiographs. A less dramatic uptake is noted in stress fractures, which may be helpful to 
differentiate between them and acute fractures [26]. When an indeter minate linear lucency is visualized on 
radiographs, a negative bone scintigraphy suggest s sesamoid bipartition [12] . Other conditions that may present 
positive findings on Tc -99m -methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scint igraphy include sesamoiditis, 
inflammatory or deposition arthropathies, osteoarthritis , and osteonecrosis [39]. In Freiberg’s infraction, a 
photopenic center with a hyperactive collar may be identified on early stages on high -resolution Tc -99m -MDP bone 
scintigraphy [27]. 
CT Foot  
CT may be useful to confirm suspected sesamoid stress fractures on radiographs and to distinguish between a stress 
fracture and a bipartite sesamoid with more precision than conventional radiography [28] .

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
In patients with chronic wrist pain, imaging studies are  an important adjunct to history, physical examination, 
laboratory testing, and electrophysiology studies. The choice of imaging modality depends on the patient’s 
presentation and the clinical questions being asked. There are scenarios in which no imaging beyond baseline 
radiographs is necessary, but in other situations advanced imaging has added value for diagnostic eva luation and 
treatment planning.  
Overview of Imaging Modalities  
Radiographs  
Imaging evaluation of the painful wrist should begin with radiog raphs [1,2]. This simple study may establish a 
specific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, 
impaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -
anterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or 
more oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling 
[3]. A v ariety of stress positions and maneuvers can be performed to elicit dynamic instability that is not visible 
on standard radiographs [ 4]. Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. 
Additionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ].

complications of the fracture.  
Variant 12: Chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or nonspecific. Suspect carpal tunnel syndrome.  Next 
study. 
US Wrist 
Several meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the 
carpal  tunnel  inlet) is highly accurate for identifying carpal  tunnel syndrome  diagnosed clinically or with the 
combination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US 
varies depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the 
measurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary 
examination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel 
syndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal 
tunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, 
clinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of 
carpal tunnel syndrome. US may be appropriate in cases where this initial evaluation is equivocal.  
MRI Wrist  
Historically, carpal tunnel syndrome has been diagnosed based on clinical signs and sympt oms and confirmed by 
the results of electrodiagnostic studies [67]. MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in cases in which this  
initial evaluation is equivocal. The MRI findings that have been reported in wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome —
including nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing—may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value 
in patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68].

Variant 5:  Ulnar -sided chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or nonspecific . Next study.  
MRI Wrist  
Both traumatic and degenerative lesions of the TFCC can produce chronic, ulnar -sided wrist pain . MRI is highly 
accurate for lesions involving the radial (central) zone of the disc, especially with the use of high -resolution fast 
spin-echo or 3-D grad ient-recalled pulse sequences [36]. There is some evidence suggesting that MRI performed 
with a 3.0 T system is even more accurate than MRI performed with a 1.5 T system for TFCC lesions [37], but 
there are no studies comparing the accuracy of the two field s trengths in the same patients. The sensitivity for 
tears of the ulnar attachment of the disc and the peripheral attachments (the ulnocarpal ligaments) are only fair 
with noncontrast -enhanced wrist MRI [ 12,36]. IV contrast seldom provides added benefit in patients with ulnar -
sided wrist pain but may increase sensitivity for TFCC lesions if MR arthrography is desired but direct joint 
injection is not feasible.

While there is no recent literature that directly addresses the role of first-line examinations for chronic wrist pain, 
radiographs are usually  appropriate as an initial study. Radiographs are widely available , and for many bone, 
joint, and alignment abnormalities, radiographs alone are diagnostic. In other patients, nonspecific radiologic findings (including those in the soft  tissues) combined with the history and physical examination may be

Historically, carpal tunnel syndrome has been diagnosed based on clinical signs and sympt oms and confirmed by 
the results of electrodiagnostic studies [67]. MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in cases in which this  
initial evaluation is equivocal. The MRI findings that have been reported in wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome —
including nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing—may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value 
in patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68].

In rare cases of secondary carpal tunnel syndrome, MRI may identify 
a mass lesion compressing the median nerve. There is some evidence that the length of T2 hyperintensity in the 
median nerve can help prognosticate the success of surgery [69] and that the shape and signal of the nerve predict 
clinical response to a steroid injection in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome [70 ]. MR neurography 
may be an option in patients with suspected carpal tunnel syndrome.  The use o f IV contrast does not contribute to 
diagnosis and is usually not appropriate.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
MR arthrography is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.  
CT Wrist  
CT, with or without IV  contrast, is not routinely used to diagnose carpa l tunnel syndrome.  
CT Arthrography  Wrist  
CT arthrography is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.  
Bone Scan  Wrist  
Bone scan is not routinely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome.  
Arthrography  Wrist

Summary of Recommendations  
• Wrist radiographs are indicated as the best initial imaging examination in patients with chronic wrist pain. 
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal and a patient has persistent symptoms wi th an unclear diagnosis, 
MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate.  
• In patients with suspected inflammatory arthritis, MRI either with or without IV contrast is usually 
appropriate if guidance for management or prognostication is needed.  
• Patients with  suspected wrist infection should undergo aspiration.  
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal in a patient with ulnar -sided pain, either MRI without IV contrast 
or an MR arthrogram of the wrist is usually appropriate.  
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal in a patient with radial -sided pain, MRI without IV contrast is 
usually appropriate.

These factors make CT the 
preferred examination for suspected distal radioulnar joint subluxation, where images of both wrists can be  
obtained in both supination and pronation [1 ,13]. A disadvantage of CT  is its lower sensitivity to soft -tissue 
abnormalities  compared with MRI.  
High-resolution (typically multidetector) CT of the wrist following contrast injection into one or more wrist 
compartments (CT arthrography) is a powerful tool for diagnosing intra -articular abnormalities [14,15]. The 
intraobserver agreement on CT arthrogram images is extremely high and better than that reported for MRI 
[14,16]. 
US 
US of the wrist is useful for examining extra -articular soft tissues, such as suspected ganglion cyst s [17], because 
its accuracy is similar to that of MRI. US can also be used to diagnose abnormalities of the flexor and extensor 
tendons and tendon sheaths. For de Quervain disease (stenosing tenosynovitis of the abductor pollicis lon gus and 
extensor pollicis brevis tendon compartment), preoperative identification of a septum or subcompartmentalization 
within the first dorsal compartment with US  may affect surgical management [18 ,19]. 
In patients with suspected or established rheumatoid arthritis (RA), US examination of the wrist and selected 
finger joints can identify erosions and active synovit is (with the use of power Doppler), findings that influence 
early diagnosis and treatment decisions [20]. Using US to measure the size of the median nerve is a  validated  
technique in patients with clinical symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome [21-24].  
In addition, w rist US is a useful technique to guide therapeutic intr a-articular and other soft -tissue injections [25].

Both traumatic and degenerative lesions of the TFCC can produce chronic, ulnar -sided wrist pain . MRI is highly 
accurate for lesions involving the radial (central) zone of the disc, especially with the use of high -resolution fast 
spin-echo or 3-D grad ient-recalled pulse sequences [36]. There is some evidence suggesting that MRI performed 
with a 3.0 T system is even more accurate than MRI performed with a 1.5 T system for TFCC lesions [37], but 
there are no studies comparing the accuracy of the two field s trengths in the same patients. The sensitivity for 
tears of the ulnar attachment of the disc and the peripheral attachments (the ulnocarpal ligaments) are only fair 
with noncontrast -enhanced wrist MRI [ 12,36]. IV contrast seldom provides added benefit in patients with ulnar -
sided wrist pain but may increase sensitivity for TFCC lesions if MR arthrography is desired but direct joint 
injection is not feasible.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
In patients with chronic wrist pain, imaging studies are  an important adjunct to history, physical examination, 
laboratory testing, and electrophysiology studies. The choice of imaging modality depends on the patient’s 
presentation and the clinical questions being asked. There are scenarios in which no imaging beyond baseline 
radiographs is necessary, but in other situations advanced imaging has added value for diagnostic eva luation and 
treatment planning.  
Overview of Imaging Modalities  
Radiographs  
Imaging evaluation of the painful wrist should begin with radiog raphs [1,2]. This simple study may establish a 
specific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, 
impaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -
anterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or 
more oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling 
[3]. A v ariety of stress positions and maneuvers can be performed to elicit dynamic instability that is not visible 
on standard radiographs [ 4]. Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. 
Additionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ].

Chronic  hip pain is a common chief  complaint  for patients , reportedly affecting  30% to 40% of adults  who play 
sports  [1,2] , and 12% to 15% of all adults  over 60 [3,4] . A wide variety  of pathological  entities  may cause hip pain, 
including  osseous  as well as intra- or extra -articular  soft tissue abnormalities  [5-7]. Pathology  involving  the lumbar  
spine,  sacroiliac,  or knee  joints  can also cause hip pain [8], and these  etiologies  should  be investigated  as needed . 
There is limited  original  research  that specifically  targets the imaging  of chronic  hip pain,  but imaging  of specific  
conditions  is widely  discussed  in the published  literature. 
Before  imaging,  an appropriate  assessment  of a patient’s  clinical  history  and physical  examination  is essential  in 
trying  to pare down the range  of possible etiologies  for a patient’s  symptoms.

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  hip pain is a common chief  complaint  for patients , reportedly affecting  30% to 40% of adults  who play 
sports  [1,2] , and 12% to 15% of all adults  over 60 [3,4] . A wide variety  of pathological  entities  may cause hip pain, 
including  osseous  as well as intra- or extra -articular  soft tissue abnormalities  [5-7]. Pathology  involving  the lumbar  
spine,  sacroiliac,  or knee  joints  can also cause hip pain [8], and these  etiologies  should  be investigated  as needed . 
There is limited  original  research  that specifically  targets the imaging  of chronic  hip pain,  but imaging  of specific  
conditions  is widely  discussed  in the published  literature. 
Before  imaging,  an appropriate  assessment  of a patient’s  clinical  history  and physical  examination  is essential  in 
trying  to pare down the range  of possible etiologies  for a patient’s  symptoms.

Findings  on pelvic  radiographs  can result  in an imaging  diagnosis  such as 
osteoarthritis  or may lead to more  advanced  workups  of less common  causes of chronic  hip pain such as primary  
bone  tumors.  The results of the pelvic  radiograph can help the clinician  for the selection  of additional  imaging  
techniques  and for comparison  with studies such as MRI,  CT, radionuclide  bone  scans,  and fluoride  PET [13-15].

Within  the limitation  of the contrast  resolution  of CT, some  extra-
articular  pathologic  entities, such as a large,  distended  bursa  may be evident  on CT. Tendinous  pathology is not 
well evaluated  on CT. 
Fluoride  PET/CT Skull Base to Mid-Thigh 
There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of fluoride  PET/CT skull base to mid-thigh in the evaluation  of 
chronic  hip pain thought  to be due to a noninfectious  extra-articular  abnormality.  
Image -Guided Anesthetic +/- Corticosteroid  Injection  Hip Joint  or Surrounding  Structures  
Fluoroscopic -, CT-, or US-guided anesthetic and/or  corticosteroid  injections  can be a useful  tool for the diagnosis  
of chronic  hip pain.  In addition to intra-articular  injections,  selective trochanteric and iliopsoas  bursal/peritendinous  
injections  can be performed  for diagnostic  purposes  using anesthetic and/or  corticosteroid  injectate,  respectively.  
Symptomatic  relief  following  selective injection  of particular  structure(s)  can help to define  the etiology  of the 
patient’s  symptoms  and guide  future  therapy [19-22]. 
MR Arthrography  Hip 
There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of MR arthrography in the evaluation  of extra -articular  soft tissue  
pathology.  
MRI Hip Without and With  IV Contrast  
There is no relevant  literature  to support  administration  of IV contrast  (gadolinium  chelate agents)  for routine  MRI 
of the hip.  
MRI Hip Without IV Contrast  
MRI without  IV contrast  is useful  for evaluating  soft tissues  given its high soft tissue contrast  resolution  [23].

US Hip 
In general,  US is limited  in its use for evaluating  osseous structures.  However,  there is limited  literature  that 
demonstrates that US can be used to evaluate osseous features of FAI such as the alpha -angle  [73]. However,  US is 
not able to adequately  evaluate osseous abnormalities  deep  to the cortex.  One of the advantages  of US is its ability  
to dynamically  evaluate for extra-articular  soft tissue  impingement.  US is not as sensitive as MRI or CT

Summary of Literature Review  
Background/Introduction 
Chronic knee pain affects tens of millions of people  in the United States annually , with the pain sometimes highly 
disabling and often negatively impacting the patient’s quality of life. Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and 
it can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain 
with the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. 
Typically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain 
persists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  
imaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated 
that approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the 
prior year) radiographs [2 ]. 
This document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  ≥5 years of age.

ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 6 Chronic Knee Pain  of age having an asymptomatic meniscal tear , and the likelihood of a meniscal tear being present in either a 
painful or asymptomatic knee not significantly different in patients 45 to 55 years of age [20,21]. 
Bone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the 
subchondral bone.  New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or 
patients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee 
pain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the 
origin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. 
Subchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed 
spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to 
elderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs 
often initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, 
and progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is 
suspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria
® 
topic on “ Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae ” [28]. 
Some patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using 
quantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs 
exhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ].

Special Imaging  Considerations  
Knee radiographs  should include at least one frontal projection of one or both knees (anteroposterior, Rosenberg, 
or tunnel), a tangential patellar view , and a lateral view of the affected knee [2,9]. Standing radiographs more 
accurately reflect medial and lateral compartment cartilage loss than supine radiographs with the posteromedial and posterolateral joint compartments  more accurately assessed using a weight -bearing flexion posteroanterior 
radiograph [9,10].

Patellofemoral car tilage loss is also associated with chronic knee pain , with active knee pain correlated with 
BMLs [30,31]. Similar to CT, MRI can calculate various anatomic measurements associated with patellofemoral 
subluxation/dislocation and lateral patellofemoral friction syndrome [32-34]. Bone marrow edema in the classic 
location for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also 
differentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise 
therapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. 
Other etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat 
pad impingement syndromes, Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome, adhesive 
capsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes , 
and osteonecrosis [15, 19,36-45].  
MRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a 
joint effusion. However, contrast -enhanced images ma y be more accurate in diagnosing other causes of chronic 
knee pain , such as Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome, and adhesive 
capsulitis [15].  In particular, enh ancing synovitis thicker than 2 mm in Hoffa’s fat is correlated with peripatellar 
pain [46]. Contrast -enhanced MRI is also useful in quantifying the degree of synovitis and in evaluating 
conditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis [ 17,42,47,48].

spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to 
elderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs 
often initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, 
and progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is 
suspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria
® 
topic on “ Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae ” [28]. 
Some patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using 
quantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs 
exhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ].

Summary of Literature Review  
Background/Introduction 
Chronic knee pain affects tens of millions of people  in the United States annually , with the pain sometimes highly 
disabling and often negatively impacting the patient’s quality of life. Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and 
it can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain 
with the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. 
Typically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain 
persists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  
imaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated 
that approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the 
prior year) radiographs [2 ]. 
This document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  ≥5 years of age.

ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 9 Acute  Trauma  to the Knee  in the setting  of the acute noncontact  ACL  injury, both the presence and the severity  of lateral  bone  contusions  were  
associated  with high-grade  pivot -shift, concomitant  lateral  meniscal  lesions as well as anterolateral  ligament  
abnormality . Klengel  et al [29] found that the apparent  diffusion coefficient  maps  are more  sensitive  than 
corresponding proton density -weighted  fat-saturated  turbo spin-echo  MRI sequences for detection  of bone  marrow  
lesions after knee  trauma  and allowed  detection  of significantly  more  and larger  bone  marrow  lesions.  Additionally,  
apparent  diffusion coefficient  map evaluation  improved diagnostic  performance in regions  with insufficient  spectral  
fat saturation,  such as the patella.  Koster  et al [30] showed  that the presence of a bone  contusion  on MRI after acute  
knee  trauma  is highly  predictive  of the development  of focal  osteoarthritis  1 year after trauma . 
MRI facilitates diagnosis  of the anterolateral  ligament injuries  that have  frequent  association  with ACL  injuries  and 
anterolateral  knee  instability , of which  a minority  are associated  with Segond fractures  [31]. In a study by Kosy  et 
al [32], MRI detected  a larger  number  of anterolateral  ligament  injuries  in association  with the ACL  injuries  within  
6 weeks of the acute knee  trauma  compared  with scans performed  later, which  suggests that some  injuries  may 
resolve or become less visible  with increased  chronicity . MRI  is proven helpful  in detection  and characterization  of 
posterolateral  corner  injuries , which  can be associated  with the ACL  ruptures  and, if missed , may lead to 
considerable morbidity.

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  shoulder  pain lasting  >6 months  is a common  presenting  complaint , particularly  in patients  ≥40 years of 
age [1]. Along with a thorough history and physical  examination,  imaging  plays  a critical  role in determining the 
source of chronic  shoul der pain.  Common pain generators in the shoulder  include  the rotator  cuff tendons,  biceps 
tendon,  labrum,  glenohumeral  articular  cartilage,  acromioclavicular  joint, bones,  suprascapular  and axillary  nerves,  
and the joint capsule/synovium.  Imaging  can help to guide  appropriate  therapy , which  can range  from  conservative  
measures such as physical  therapy  and cortico steroid  injections  to more  invasive  procedures  such as arthroscopy or 
surgery . This document  focuses on the imaging approach  to patients  with suspected  chronic  mechanical  shoulder  
pain.

Although evaluation  of glenoid bony integrity  is typically  better  with CT imaging,  some  practitioners have  used 
ultrashort  or zero echo  time sequences [96-98], 3-D sequences  [99], or conventional  MRI  sequences  [100]  to 
measure glenoid bone  loss with a high concordance  to CT images.  
Radiography Shoulder  Additional Views  
There are several  options  for additional  radiographic  views in patients  with suspected  instability  [1]. The West  Point  
and Garth  views can demonstrate the anterior  inferior glenoid at a better  advantage  in patients  with a suspected  
Bankart  fracture.  A Stryker  notch  view can sometimes demonstrate  a Hill-Sachs lesion  that is difficult  to see on 
conventional  projections.  Although these additional  projections  are used by some  practitioners , they do not usually  
alleviate  the need  for advanced  imaging.  
US Shoulder  
The posterior  labrum  can be reliably  visualized  with US, with posterior  labral  tears potentially  visualized  
particularly  if the joint is distended  [101] . However,  US is of limited  benefit  in assessing  the anterior  
labroligamentous  complex,  superior  labrum,  articular  surface,  and subchondral  bone.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Traumatic shoulder pain is shoulder pain believed to be directly attributed to a traumatic event, either acute or 
chronic. This pain may be the result of either fracture (the clavicle, scapula, or proximal humerus) or soft -tissue 
injury (most commonly of the rotator cuff, acromioclavicular ligaments, or labroligamentous complex). The 
incidence of traumatic shoulder injuries is difficult to determine because some injury types, such as low-grade 
acromioclavicular separations or acute rotator cuff tears, are likely under -reported because patients  do not seek 
immediate medical treatment. However, as with many traumatic injuries, traumatic shoulder pain tends to 
disproportionately involve young adults and male patients [ 1,2]. 
The etiology of traumatic shoulder pain can often be made based on clinical examination, radiographs, and 
mechanism of injury. Traumatic shoulder injuries can generally be separated into in juries requiring acute surgical 
management and injuries in which conservative management can be attempted prior to considering surgical 
treatment. Unstable or significantly displaced fractures and joint instability are injuries most likely requiring acute 
surgical treatment.

72% to 92%, which  is similar  to nonc ontrast  MRI and slightly  lower  than MR arthrography [24,47] . Fatty  infiltration  
within  the rotator  cuff muscles can be adequately  demonstrated  with US [48]. US may; however , be less accurate  
than MRI in measuring  tear size and the degree of retraction  in larger  tears [49]. US allows excellent  evaluation  of 
the bursae situated  about  the shoulder , particularly  the subacromial  subdeltoid bursa  [50]. Color  flow imaging  can 
demonstrate hyperemia  in cases of bursitis  with a significant  inflammatory  component  [51].

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  shoulder  pain lasting  >6 months  is a common  presenting  complaint , particularly  in patients  ≥40 years of 
age [1]. Along with a thorough history and physical  examination,  imaging  plays  a critical  role in determining the 
source of chronic  shoul der pain.  Common pain generators in the shoulder  include  the rotator  cuff tendons,  biceps 
tendon,  labrum,  glenohumeral  articular  cartilage,  acromioclavicular  joint, bones,  suprascapular  and axillary  nerves,  
and the joint capsule/synovium.  Imaging  can help to guide  appropriate  therapy , which  can range  from  conservative  
measures such as physical  therapy  and cortico steroid  injections  to more  invasive  procedures  such as arthroscopy or 
surgery . This document  focuses on the imaging approach  to patients  with suspected  chronic  mechanical  shoulder  
pain.

Initial imaging.  
A symptomatic primary shoulder arthroplasty has a wide variety of potential etiologies that includ es loosening, 
infection, periprosthetic fracture, and rotator cuff tear. Periprosthetic  fractures of the glenoid  and humerus  can occur  
intraoperatively  as well as postoperatively.  Complications  related  to surgical  technique,  such as excessive  reaming  
or impaction,  are the most  common  reasons for fractures in the intraoperative  setting,  with a reported  incidence of 
2.1%  [6]. In the postoperative setting, a 1% incidence  of periprosthetic  fractures  has been  reported;  patients’  other  
medical  comorbidities  (assessed  using the Deyo -Charlson  index)  are found to be significant  risk factors [10,19] . 
Humeral  fractures  have  been  found to be more  common than glenoid fractures.  Fractures of the acromion  and spine  
of the scapula are more  common  in the setting  of reverse total shoulder  arthroplasty  and are thought  to be related  to 
an intraoperative  complication  or, more  commonly,  chronic  stress [4]. 
3-Phase  Bone  Scan  with  SPECT  or SPECT/CT Shoulder  
There is no relevant literature to support the use of a 3 -phase bone scan with SPECT or SPECT/CT as a first-line 
imaging modality in the acutely symptomatic patient with a primary shoulder arthroplasty.  Similar  to bone  scans,  a 
3-phase bone  scan is highly sensitive for the detection  of periprosthetic  fractures  but suffers  from  low specificity.

Proposed causes for this higher  prevalence include  longer  procedural  time and steeper  learning  curve  to perform

Glenohumeral  osteoarthritis  is typically  well visualized  on conventional  radiographic  views,  without  the need  for 
special  views.  A standard  axillary  view can demonstrate posterior  subluxation of the humeral  head  and abnormal  
glenoid morphology in patients with severe osteoarthritis  [145-147] . A measurement  of the critical shoulder  angle  
can be drawn  on routine  AP radiographs  by measuring  the angle  between  a line along the glenoid  surface and a line 
from  the inferior glenoid to the lateral  acromial  margin;  patients  with a higher  measurement  may be at high risk of 
having a full thickness rotator  cuff tear [148] .

Although secondary  signs  of osteoarthritis  such as osteophytes,  joint effusion , and intra-articular  bodies  can be seen 
with US [142] , it is not typically  performed  for this indication.

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  shoulder  pain lasting  >6 months  is a common  presenting  complaint , particularly  in patients  ≥40 years of 
age [1]. Along with a thorough history and physical  examination,  imaging  plays  a critical  role in determining the 
source of chronic  shoul der pain.  Common pain generators in the shoulder  include  the rotator  cuff tendons,  biceps 
tendon,  labrum,  glenohumeral  articular  cartilage,  acromioclavicular  joint, bones,  suprascapular  and axillary  nerves,  
and the joint capsule/synovium.  Imaging  can help to guide  appropriate  therapy , which  can range  from  conservative  
measures such as physical  therapy  and cortico steroid  injections  to more  invasive  procedures  such as arthroscopy or 
surgery . This document  focuses on the imaging approach  to patients  with suspected  chronic  mechanical  shoulder  
pain.

The presence  of glenohumeral  osteoarthritis  on initial radiographs  does not typically  require  additional  imaging  
unless additional pathology  is suspected,  such as a rotator  cuff tear or surgery  is a consideration . 
Bone  Scan  Shoulder  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of bone  scan shoulder  in the evaluation  of chronic  shoulder  pain 
when  initial radiographs  demonstrate  osteoarthritis.  
CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
CT arthrography  can be helpful  in the preoperative  planning  of total shoulder  arthroplasty  in patients  with severe 
glenohumeral  arthritis. CT arthrography  provides  excellent  imaging  of osseous detail allowing  for characterization  
of glenoid morphology,  version,  and bone  loss. Unlike  nonarthrogram  CT, CT arthrography  allows for adequate  
characterization  of a rotator  cuff tear [16,17] , which  may alter the chosen  arthroplasty  type. Arthrogram  contrast  
also outlines  the articular  cartilage surface,  demonstrating areas of cartilage  loss, which  cannot  be directly  visualized  
with conventional  CT. 
CT Shoulder  With  IV Contrast  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of CT shoulder  with IV contrast  in the evaluation  of chronic  
shoulder  pain when  initial radiographs  demonstrate  osteoarthritis.

Postoperative  abnormalities  and associated  conditions  include  patients’  dissatisfaction,  prosthetic

with reverse  total shoulder  arthroplasti es), tears of the rotator  cuff tendons,  infection, nerve  injury,  and deltoid  
dysfunction [3]. The most  common  complication  for hemiarthroplasties has been  erosion  of the unresurfaced  
glenoid (20.6%),  whereas glenoid loosening (14.3%)  has been  reported  as the most  common  complication  for total 
shoulder  arthroplasties [6]. The rate of perioperative  complications, such as blood loss, thromboembolism,  and 
immediate  postoperative  infection, has been  shown  to be similar  for both types  of surgeries [7]. The most  common  
complications  associated  with reverse total shoulder  arthroplasties  are scapular  notching,  dislocation,  periprosthetic  
fractures,  glenoid baseplate failure,  and acromial  fractures [8,9] . 
Symptoms  relate d to postoperative  difficulties  include  activity -related  pain,  decreased  range  of motion,  and

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  hip pain is a common chief  complaint  for patients , reportedly affecting  30% to 40% of adults  who play 
sports  [1,2] , and 12% to 15% of all adults  over 60 [3,4] . A wide variety  of pathological  entities  may cause hip pain, 
including  osseous  as well as intra- or extra -articular  soft tissue abnormalities  [5-7]. Pathology  involving  the lumbar  
spine,  sacroiliac,  or knee  joints  can also cause hip pain [8], and these  etiologies  should  be investigated  as needed . 
There is limited  original  research  that specifically  targets the imaging  of chronic  hip pain,  but imaging  of specific  
conditions  is widely  discussed  in the published  literature. 
Before  imaging,  an appropriate  assessment  of a patient’s  clinical  history  and physical  examination  is essential  in 
trying  to pare down the range  of possible etiologies  for a patient’s  symptoms.

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
It has been  approximately  60 years since Sir John Charnl ey introduced the modern era of hip replacement  surgery  
[1]. Approximately  370,000 primary  total hip arthroplasties (THAs)  were performed  in the United  States in 2014  
[2]. Sloan  et al [2] estimated  that the volume of primary  THAs  would  increase to 635,000 procedure s annually by 
2030.  
Over  the years,  modifications  have  been  made  to attempt  to decrease  complications  such as loosening and wear  
with additional  fixation  techniques  (eg, osseointegration ) and articular  surfaces  (eg, metal  on highly  cross -linked  
polyethylene , antioxidant  doped polyethylene  liners,  metal -on-metal  [MoM], ceramic on polyethylene , and ceramic  
on ceramic articulations)  [3-5]. 
Second -generation  MoM prostheses were introduced in the late 1990s  [6]. These  prostheses were preferentially  
used for younger  patients  with osteoarthritis  [7].

techniques  and for comparison  with studies such as MRI,  CT, radionuclide  bone  scans,  and fluoride  PET [13-15].

from  81% to 88% and 50% to 74% versus 81% to 85% and 74% to 85%, respectively , for radiographs.  Hill et al 
[80] reviewed  the results of 3-phase bone  scans performed  on 100 patients  with a painful  hip prosthesis.  They 
reported that an abnormal scan could not differentiate aseptic loosening from infection. Although a normal result 
excluded aseptic loosening and infection, the ability of the bone scan to identify or exclude other conditions such as wear, osteolysis, and soft tissue abnormalities as the cause of the patient’s symptoms was not addressed.

(ARMD ) have been  used to refer  to the spectrum  of findings  in failed  metal  on metal  articulations  [11-13]. The 
term metallosis  refers  to infiltration  of metallic  wear  debris  into periprosthetic  structures [14]. 
The most  common  causes  for surgical  revision  of THA  from 2012 to 2019 as reported  in the American  Academy  
of Orthopaedic  Surgeons  American  Joint  Replacement  Registry  were infection  and inflammatory  reaction  (19.3%),  
instability  (17.4%),  and aseptic loosening (15.8% ) [15-17]. Wear  or osteolysis was the cause for revision  in 7.5%.

complications are reviewed . Separate discussions pertinent to imaging of MoM prostheses are included.  
Special Imaging  Considerations  
Ultrasound (US) : US has been  used for assessment  of soft tissues adjacent  to hip arthroplasties and, in contrast  to 
MRI and CT, is not affected  by prosthetic  artifacts.  US may be limited  in its ability  to assess deep  soft tissues.

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
It has been  approximately  60 years since Sir John Charnl ey introduced the modern era of hip replacement  surgery  
[1]. Approximately  370,000 primary  total hip arthroplasties (THAs)  were performed  in the United  States in 2014  
[2]. Sloan  et al [2] estimated  that the volume of primary  THAs  would  increase to 635,000 procedure s annually by 
2030.  
Over  the years,  modifications  have  been  made  to attempt  to decrease  complications  such as loosening and wear  
with additional  fixation  techniques  (eg, osseointegration ) and articular  surfaces  (eg, metal  on highly  cross -linked  
polyethylene , antioxidant  doped polyethylene  liners,  metal -on-metal  [MoM], ceramic on polyethylene , and ceramic  
on ceramic articulations)  [3-5]. 
Second -generation  MoM prostheses were introduced in the late 1990s  [6]. These  prostheses were preferentially  
used for younger  patients  with osteoarthritis  [7].

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Fractures of the proximal femur (commonly referred to as hip fractures)  are a frequent  source of morbidity and 
mortality in elderly osteoporotic patients [1]. Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type 
result in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men 
[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs 
will continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of 
life following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays 
in diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -
and long-term mortality [6-13]. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of hip fractures is critical. Hip fractures 
cannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded on the basis of physical exam ination  alone ; therefore , imaging plays a 
key role in early  and accurate diagnosis [14] .

However , reports  of high short -term  failure  rates led to recalls  and 
decreased  use [8,9] . These articulations  (and also metal  to metal  articulations  at the head  neck  [trunnion] and neck  
stem  articulation s of modular  components)  may result  in the release of metal  particles and metal  ions leading  to 
macroscopic necrosis,  osteolysis,  large sterile  hip effusions,  and periprosthetic  solid  and cystic masses termed  
“pseudotumors”  [10]. The umbrella  terms  adverse local  tissue reaction  (ALTR ) and adverse reaction  to metal  debris  
(ARMD ) have been  used to refer  to the spectrum  of findings  in failed  metal  on metal  articulations  [11-13]. The 
term metallosis  refers  to infiltration  of metallic  wear  debris  into periprosthetic  structures [14]. 
The most  common  causes  for surgical  revision  of THA  from 2012 to 2019 as reported  in the American  Academy  
of Orthopaedic  Surgeons  American  Joint  Replacement  Registry  were infection  and inflammatory  reaction  (19.3%),  
instability  (17.4%),  and aseptic loosening (15.8% ) [15-17]. Wear  or osteolysis was the cause for revision  in 7.5%.  
The imaging studies used to follow uncomplicated primary hip prostheses and to assess several prosthesis-related 
complications are reviewed . Separate discussions pertinent to imaging of MoM prostheses are included.  
Special Imaging  Considerations  
Ultrasound (US) : US has been  used for assessment  of soft tissues adjacent  to hip arthroplasties and, in contrast  to 
MRI and CT, is not affected  by prosthetic  artifacts.  US may be limited  in its ability  to assess deep  soft tissues.

MRI can demonstrate femoral  periprosthetic  fractures  and stress reactions [18]. However,  a nondis placed  fracture  
may be difficult to see on MRI if there is only mild associated  marrow edema,  and susceptibility  artifact  from  the 
prosthesis may obscure  the pertinent  findings  [72]. Pelvic  fractures  can be demonstrated.  There is no relevant

includes  major  and minor  criteria  but not specifically  imaging criteria  [75]. 
Bone  Scan  and Gallium  Scan  Hip 
The most  recent  data on bone  and gallium  scans for diagnosing periprosthetic  hip infection  are more  than 25 years

Bone  Scan and Gallium  Scan  with SPECT  or SPECT/CT Hip 
There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of bone  and gallium  scan with SPECT or SPECT/CT of the hip as 
these tests have  been  replaced  by leukocyte  and bone  marrow  imaging  and FDG-PET for diagnosing  periprosthetic  
hip infection.  
Bone  Scan  Hip 
Bone  scan of the hip is sensitive but not specific for periprosthetic  hip infection.  Performing  the test as a 3-phase  
bone  scan does not improve  accuracy,  with reported  sensitivity  and specificity  ranging  from  29% to 88% and 50%

and specificities of 73.1%  to 100.0%.  Albano et al [109]  found  lymph  node  assessment  (of the affected  compared  
to the unaffected  hip) identified  infected  implants  with high accuracies (up to 93.1%).  Galley  et al [110]  found 
periosteal  reaction, capsular  edema,  and intramuscular  edema after THA at 1.5T MRI with MAR  to have  high 
accuracy  in the evaluation  of periprosthetic  joint infection  (86%-91%  accuracy).  Schwaiger  et al [112]  were able to

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Fractures of the proximal femur (commonly referred to as hip fractures)  are a frequent  source of morbidity and 
mortality in elderly osteoporotic patients [1]. Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type 
result in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men 
[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs 
will continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of 
life following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays 
in diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -
and long-term mortality [6-13]. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of hip fractures is critical. Hip fractures 
cannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded on the basis of physical exam ination  alone ; therefore , imaging plays a 
key role in early  and accurate diagnosis [14] .

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  hip pain is a common chief  complaint  for patients , reportedly affecting  30% to 40% of adults  who play 
sports  [1,2] , and 12% to 15% of all adults  over 60 [3,4] . A wide variety  of pathological  entities  may cause hip pain, 
including  osseous  as well as intra- or extra -articular  soft tissue abnormalities  [5-7]. Pathology  involving  the lumbar  
spine,  sacroiliac,  or knee  joints  can also cause hip pain [8], and these  etiologies  should  be investigated  as needed . 
There is limited  original  research  that specifically  targets the imaging  of chronic  hip pain,  but imaging  of specific  
conditions  is widely  discussed  in the published  literature. 
Before  imaging,  an appropriate  assessment  of a patient’s  clinical  history  and physical  examination  is essential  in 
trying  to pare down the range  of possible etiologies  for a patient’s  symptoms.

The biomechanics of proximal femoral and pelvic fractures that are a result of major trauma differs as these 
injuries may be seen in any age group, often with additional accompanying high-velocity injuri es of the abdomen 
and pelvis . Motor vehicle –related trauma is the most common  mechanism. Thorough evaluation of the hip may be 
superseded  in these instances by the need for resuscitation and diagnosis and treatment of more urgent associated 
vascular or solid organ injuries. Imaging plays an important role not only in the diagnosis of high-velocity 
fractures but also in characterizing fracture mechanism and morphology for treatment planning purposes.  
However, imaging of high-velocity hip fractures occurs in the context of a broader trauma evaluation. A full 
discussion of the broader imaging workup of blunt trauma is beyond the scope of this paper and will be covered in 
the upcoming ACR Appropriateness Criteria® titled “Major Blunt Trauma” and will be made available on the 
ACR website  when completed . 
Treatment  for both intra - and extracapsular proximal femoral fractures in the elderly is typically surgical fixation  
because of the risk of further fracture displacement and the dangers of prolonged immobilization in the elderly 
[15]. Joint replacement may be  performed for displaced fractures of the femoral neck where the risk of femoral 
head avascular necrosis is high. Fractures from high -force trauma are also commonly treated with surgical 
fixation for stability to reduce the risk of post -traumatic osteo arthritis. 
Discussion of Procedures by Variant  
Variant 1:  Acute hip pain. Fall or minor trauma. Suspect fracture. Initial imaging.  
Radiography Hip 
Radiography is the initial imaging modality of choice for assessment of acute hip pain with suspected fracture , 
with the more advanced imaging modalities reserved for instances of clinically suspected fracture in the setting of 
negative or equivocal radiographs. Radiographs are rapidly obtained and well tolerated by patients. When a 
fracture is demonstrated , freque ntly no more imaging is needed for treatment planning purposes [15 -17].

Around  10% to 30% of the 
patients  report  ongoing pain or are not satisfied  with the result  [9]. Factors,  which  contribute  to patient  
dissatisfaction , include  unmet  expectations,  functional  limitations,  and postoperative  complications  including pain 
[10]. Most  TKA  patients  expe rience improved outcomes  and long implant survival,  with long-term  TKA failure  
rates of <1% per year [5]. The growth in the number  of primary  TKA  procedures  has been  accompanied  by increased  
rates of TKA revision  procedures  [1]. Revision  procedures  for TKAs have  increased  by 5.4 procedures  per 100,000  
persons  per decade over the period from  1990  to 2002,  with a mean  revision  burden of 8.2%  [11]. Nearly  1.5 million  
of those  with primary  knee  replacement  are 50 to 69 years  of age, underscoring a large population at risk for revision  
surgery  and long-term  complications  [5]. Sharkey  et al [12] reviewed  781 revision  TKAs and found  the most  
common  failure  mechanisms  were  loosening (39.9%),  infection  (27.4%),  instability  (7.5%),  periprosthetic  fracture  
(4.7%),  and arthrofibrosis  (4.5%) . Infection  was the most  common  reason  for early  revision  (<2 years after the 
initial TKA) , and aseptic loosening was the most  common  reason  for late revision.  Compared  with a review  
performed  by the same  author  in 2002 [13], polyethylene  wear  is no longer  the major  cause  of failure , and the 
percentages of revisions  for polyethylene  wear,  instability, arthrofibrosis,  malalignment,  and extensor  mechanism

Periprosthetic  fractures may occur  either  during or after surgery  and can involve  the femur,  tibia, or patella.  Among  
periprosthetic  fractures,  supracondylar  distal  femur  fractures are most  common,  whereas patellar  fractures are rare

often  occur  in the setting  of low-energy  trauma  [136] . Tibial fractures  are associated  with loose  components  and

Severe instability  can result  in 
dislocation. In a 2014 review of 781 cases of prosthesis failure,  Sharkey  et al [12] found that instability  represented  
the third  most  common  cause of prosthesis failure  overall,  accounting  for 7.5%  of all cases.  The concepts of 
instability, malalignment, and loosening in TKA are closely  interrelated  [117] . When  malalignme nt of the joint is 
created  at the time of surgery,  minor  degrees of instability  can become a significant  problem.  By the same  token,  
instability, ongoing over time, can give rise to malalignment, which,  in turn, can lead to loosening.  Although 
ligamentous  balance/imbalance plays  a role in joint instability, it is not the only factor  accounting for stability  [118] . 
3-Phase  Bone  Scan  Knee  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  routine  use of Tc-99m  3-phase bone  scans for the assessment  of instability.  
Bone  scintigraphy may be helpful  in diagnosing loosening,  especially  when  obtained many  years after surgery  [62]. 
This delay  in maximum utility  is because of  the observation that positive  bone  scans are noted in 20% of 
asymptomatic knees 1 year after surge ry and in 12.5%  of individuals  2 years after surgery [61] . Serial  bone  scans 
may be more  helpful  than a single  examination  [119] . Generally,  increased  uptake  on the delayed  images  but not 
on the blood- pool phase is thought  to be due to loosening rather  than to infection  [60]. Normal  scans are most  
helpful  and are characterized  by a high NPV,  indicating  that loosening or infection  is unlikely.  A potential false  
negative ; however,  may occur  if there is loosening at the cement –prosthetic  interface that does not incite  new bone  
formation  [66].

Staphylococcus  aureus  and coagulase-negative  Staphylococcus  species,  including  Staphylococcus  epidermidis,  are 
the most  common organisms  associated  with these infections  [46]. Both  clinical  findings  and laboratory tests may 
serve useful  in addition  to imaging  studies.  Low-grade  or chronic  TKA  infections  may be difficult to diagnose  
preoperatively.  Duff  et al [18] noted that diagnosis  of infection  was not obvious  in 53% of knees before  revision  
arthroplasty.  Pain is the most  common  presenting  symptom  of infection, but pain is a nonspecific finding [47]. In 
acute infection,  findings  such as pain,  swelling,  warmth,  erythema,  and fever  are common,  whereas chronic  
infections  may be manifested  by pain alone  [44]. Night  pain or pain at rest is characteristic of infection, whereas  
pain on weightbearing  is more  characteristic of mechanical  loosening.  Some  authors  suggest  that infection  needs to 
be excluded  in all patients  with pain persisting  >6 months  after joint replacement  [18]. 
Laboratory findings  in the setting  of TKA infection  are often  nonspecific.  Peripheral  leukocyte  counts  are not 
elevated  in most  patients  with infected  prostheses.  Erythrocyte  sedimentation  rates (ESRs) are abnormal  in patients  
with infection, but this finding  may also be seen in uninfected  patients,  limiting  the usefulness of the test [48]. A 
retrospective review of 68 patients  undergoing hip and knee  revision  surgery  indicated  that C-reactive protein  (CRP)  
was significantly  higher  in patients  with infection  compared  with those  with loosening (sensitivity  of 79% for all

acute infection,  findings  such as pain,  swelling,  warmth,  erythema,  and fever  are common,  whereas chronic  
infections  may be manifested  by pain alone  [44]. Night  pain or pain at rest is characteristic of infection, whereas  
pain on weightbearing  is more  characteristic of mechanical  loosening.  Some  authors  suggest  that infection  needs to 
be excluded  in all patients  with pain persisting  >6 months  after joint replacement  [18]. 
Laboratory findings  in the setting  of TKA infection  are often  nonspecific.  Peripheral  leukocyte  counts  are not 
elevated  in most  patients  with infected  prostheses.  Erythrocyte  sedimentation  rates (ESRs) are abnormal  in patients  
with infection, but this finding  may also be seen in uninfected  patients,  limiting  the usefulness of the test [48]. A 
retrospective review of 68 patients  undergoing hip and knee  revision  surgery  indicated  that C-reactive protein  (CRP)  
was significantly  higher  in patients  with infection  compared  with those  with loosening (sensitivity  of 79% for all 
prostheses) ; however , a normal  CRP  level  did not exclude  infection  [49].

Around  10% to 30% of the 
patients  report  ongoing pain or are not satisfied  with the result  [9]. Factors,  which  contribute  to patient  
dissatisfaction , include  unmet  expectations,  functional  limitations,  and postoperative  complications  including pain 
[10]. Most  TKA  patients  expe rience improved outcomes  and long implant survival,  with long-term  TKA failure  
rates of <1% per year [5]. The growth in the number  of primary  TKA  procedures  has been  accompanied  by increased  
rates of TKA revision  procedures  [1]. Revision  procedures  for TKAs have  increased  by 5.4 procedures  per 100,000  
persons  per decade over the period from  1990  to 2002,  with a mean  revision  burden of 8.2%  [11]. Nearly  1.5 million  
of those  with primary  knee  replacement  are 50 to 69 years  of age, underscoring a large population at risk for revision  
surgery  and long-term  complications  [5]. Sharkey  et al [12] reviewed  781 revision  TKAs and found  the most  
common  failure  mechanisms  were  loosening (39.9%),  infection  (27.4%),  instability  (7.5%),  periprosthetic  fracture  
(4.7%),  and arthrofibrosis  (4.5%) . Infection  was the most  common  reason  for early  revision  (<2 years after the 
initial TKA) , and aseptic loosening was the most  common  reason  for late revision.  Compared  with a review  
performed  by the same  author  in 2002 [13], polyethylene  wear  is no longer  the major  cause  of failure , and the 
percentages of revisions  for polyethylene  wear,  instability, arthrofibrosis,  malalignment,  and extensor  mechanism  
deficiency  have  all decreased.

Li et al [95] also reported  a different  lamellated  and hyperintense  appearance of the synovium  in infected  
joints, which  can be differentiated  from  frond -like and hypertrophied synovium  associated  with particle -induced 
synovitis  and from  homogeneous  fluid -signal  intensity  effusion  associated  with a nonspecific  synovitis.  MRI with

US Knee  
US has a limited  role in the workup of periprosthetic  infection, but it can be readily  used to assess soft tissues,

CRP  has a sensitivity  of 73% to 91% and 
a specificity  of 81% to 86% for the diagnosis  of prosthetic  knee  infection  when  a cutoff  of ≥13.5 mg/L  is used [44]. 
Although CRP  can be elevated  after surgery,  under  normal  circumstances  it generally  returns  to baseline within  2 
months  [44]. A large multicenter  study found CRP  and joint aspiration  to be the most  useful  tools  to diagnose  
infection  [50]. In an attempt  to construct  an algorithm  for evaluating  TKA infection,  Savarino  et al [51] found that 
abnormal  results  for at least 2 of 3 tests (CRP  [cutoff  0.93 mg/L],  ESR [cutoff 27 mm/h],  and fibrinogen  [cutoff  
432 mg/dL])  led to accurate results for the diagnosis  of infection  (sensitivity, 93%;  specificity,  100%;  accuracy,  
97%) . More  recently,  interle ukin-6  has also shown  promise  for diagnosing  infection , with higher  predictive  values 
than most  other  serologic  markers [52], and has shown  excellent  sensitivity  for detecting  infection  after TKA when  
combined with CRP  [53]. The American  Academy  of Orthopaedi c Surgeons  (AAOS ) guidelines  strongly  
recommend  the use of ESR, CRP , and serum  interleukin -6 testing  for patients  being assessed  for periprosthetic  joint 
infection  [54]. Serologic  tests can be hard to interpret  when  underlying inflamm atory  arthropathy is present  [28]. 
More  recently,  the use of an alpha -defensin  laboratory  test has been  described  for the diagnosis  of periprosthetic  
joint infection.

Local  recurrence  rates  of bone  sarcomas  are reported  to be approximately  10% to 15% 
in patients  with osteosarcoma  and Ewing  sarcoma  [58-61]. Prognosis  is poor for locally  recurrent  malignant  or 
aggressive  bone  tumors,  with postrecurrence  5-year survival  rates  reported  approximately  15% to 30% in patients  
with osteosarcoma  and 5% in patients  with Ewing  sarcoma  [60,62] . Factors  associated  with poorer  prognosis  in 
patients  with osteosarcoma  were  size of local  recurrence  (>5 cm) and presence  of distant  metastasis  [60]. 
Recommendations  for local  recurrence  surveillance  imaging  vary amongst  expert  guidelines,  although  all 
acknowledge  the benefit  of clinical  evaluation.  Locally  recurrent  bone  tumors  can often  present  as a soft tissue  
mass,  and in a study  of osteosarcoma  local  recurrences,  the majority  (approximately  75%)  were  soft tissue  masses  
rather  than bone  lesions  [60]. Some  guidelines  recommend  clinical  exam ination  to be performed  solely , whereas  
others  recommend  in combination  with imaging  [49,51,52,63] . Time  to recurrence  also varies  with tumor  histology.  
Most  osteosarcoma  local  recurrences  have  been  shown  to occur  within  5 years  of resection.  However,  late 
recurrence  of both osteosarcoma  and Ewing  sarcoma  have  been  reported  [60,61] . In a study  of locally  recurrent  
osteosarcoma,  survival  rates  decreased  from  30% at 5 years  to 13% at 10 years,  suggesting  long-term follow -up 
beyond  5 years  is beneficial.

FDG -PET/CT  Whole  Body  
A meta -analysis  of FDG -PET/CT  for the staging  of patients  with osteosarcoma  demonstrated  an overall  sensitivity  
of 93% and a specificity  of 97% for detection  of bone  metastases  [6]. Coverage  of a whole  body  FDG -PET/CT  
varies  and usually  extends  either  from  skull  base to thighs  or skull  vertex  to feet. A study  of FDG -PET/CT  in 
patients  with sarcoma  and melanoma  showed  inclusion  of the entire  lower  extremities  does not add additional  
benefit  in identifying  metastases  [31]. 
FDG -PET/CT  is considered  superior  to Tc-99m bone  scan in the detection  of osseous  metastases.  Literature  has 
concluded  this in both general  oncologic  and bone  sarcoma  populations  [30]. FDG -PET/C T is also superior  to CT 
imaging  in this regard.  Quartuccio  et al [22] studied  64 pediatric  patients  with bone  sarcoma  and found  greater  
accuracy  of FDG -PET/CT  (85%  accuracy)  versus  CT (44% accuracy)  in detecting  bone  metastases  during  initial  
staging  of patients  with Ewing  sarcoma.  There  are mixed  conclusions  when  comparing  FDG -PET/CT  versus  MRI  
whole  body  in detecting  osseous  metastases  in general  oncology  populations  [32-34]. In a small  study  of 20 patients  
with Ewing  sarcoma  comparing  FDG -PET/CT  with MRI  whole  body , a single  patient  had a false -positive  bone  
finding  on FDG -PET/CT.

inflammatory  back  disease  (eg, ankylosing spondylitis), vertebral  compression  fracture,  or symptomatic  spinal  
stenosis,  imaging  should be considered  after a trial of therapy  [4]. 
In the majority  of patients, no specific pathology for LBP can be identified. Also,  studies have  shown  imaging  
abnormalities  in a substantial  number  of people  without back  pain [11-13]. The challenge for the clinician, therefore,  
is to distin guish the small  segment  within  this large patient  population that should be evaluated  further because of 
suspicion  of a more  serious  problem  or identify  pathology that requires intervention . 
Other  nonspine  causes of LBP can have overlap  in clinical  presentation,  including inflammatory  arthritis  and other  
systemic conditions , such as pelvic,  renal,  vascular,  or gastrointestinal  etiologies.  If an inflammatory  etiology  is 
suspected  as the cause of LBP, such as ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic  spondylitis, reactive arthritis, or

Previous  guidelines  have  suggested  that imaging  be performed  in adults  >50 years of age who present  with LBP. 
When  studied,  there was no statistically  significant  difference in primary  outcome  after 1 year for patients  aged  65 
years or older  who had spine  imaging  within  6 weeks after an initial  visit for care for LBP versus similar  patients  
who did not undergo early  imaging  [9]; thus,  this document  does not include  >50 years of age as an independent  
red flag. However, an important age-related risk factor for spinal fracture presenting as LBP  is osteoporosis.  As 
bone mass decreases slowly over time, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age, and differs by sex, race, 
ethnicity  [10], and comorbidities.

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
In the United  States,  acute low back  pain (LBP),  with or without radiculopathy , is the leading  cause of years lived  
with disability  and the third  ranking cause of disability -adjusted  life years  [1]. It is the fifth most  common  reason  
for a physician  visit in the United  States  and accounts for approximately  3% of visits  to the emergency  department  
[2]. 
The American  College  of Physicians and the American  Pain Society  classify  LBP into the following  broad  
categories:  nonspecific LBP, back  pain potentially  associated  with radiculopathy or spinal  stenosis,  and back  pain 
potentially  associated  with another  specific spinal  cause [3].

Additionally,  guidelines  from  the American  College  
of Physicians and the American  Pain Society  [3,4]  emphasize a focused  history  and physical  examination,  
reassurance,  initial pain management  medications if necessary,  and consideration  of physical  therapies without  
routine  imaging  in patients  with nonspecific  LBP. Duration  of symptoms  also helps  guide  treatment  algorithms  in 
patients  with acute,  subacute,  or chronic  LBP. Additionally, assessment  of psychosocial  risk factors when  obtaining  
patient  history  is a strong predictor  of patients  who are predisposed  to developing chronic  disabling LBP problems  
[3]. 
Although there  is great  variability  in the definition  of acute and subacute  LBP, for the purposes  of this guideline,  
we will use the Institute  for Clinical Systems  Improvement  definitions  of 0 to 4 weeks to define  acute LBP,  4 to 12 
weeks for subacute LBP, and >12 weeks for chronic  LBP [5]. 
It is clear  that uncomplicated  acute  LBP and/or  radiculopathy is a benign,  self-limited  condition  that does not 
warrant  any imaging studies [4,6,7] . Imaging is considered  in those  patients who have  had up to 6 weeks of medical  
management  and physical  therapy  that resulted  in little or no improvement  in their back  pain.  It is also considered  
for those  patients  presenting  with red flags , raising  suspicion  for a serious underlying  condition,  such as cauda 
equina  syndrome  (CES),  malignancy,  fracture,  or infection  (see Table 1).

Summary of Literature Review  
Background/Introduction 
Chronic knee pain affects tens of millions of people  in the United States annually , with the pain sometimes highly 
disabling and often negatively impacting the patient’s quality of life. Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and 
it can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain 
with the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. 
Typically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain 
persists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  
imaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated 
that approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the 
prior year) radiographs [2 ]. 
This document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  ≥5 years of age.

ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 6 Chronic Knee Pain  of age having an asymptomatic meniscal tear , and the likelihood of a meniscal tear being present in either a 
painful or asymptomatic knee not significantly different in patients 45 to 55 years of age [20,21]. 
Bone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the 
subchondral bone.  New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or 
patients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee 
pain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the 
origin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. 
Subchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed 
spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to 
elderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs 
often initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, 
and progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is 
suspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria
® 
topic on “ Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae ” [28]. 
Some patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using 
quantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs 
exhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ].

The 
variants discussed include: (1) initial exam ination ; (2) initial radiograph is normal or demonstrates a joint 
effusion; (3) initial radiogr aph demonstrates osteochondritis dissecans (OCD), loose bodies or history of cartilage,  
or meniscal repair; (4) initial radiograph demonstrates osteoarthritis or chondrocalcinosis; and (5)  initial 
radiograph demonstrates signs of prior (chronic) knee injur y (ie, Segond fract ure, tibial spine avulsion, etc ).  
To evaluat e knee pain associated with other conditions, please refer to the following ACR Appropriateness 
Criteria® topic on:  “Osteonecrosi s of the Hip ” [3] for osteonecrosis,  “Acute Trauma to the Knee ” for acute knee 
injuries  [4], “Imaging After Total Knee Arthroplasty ” for patients with total knee arthroplasty  [5], “Soft-Tissue

or known bone tumor [ 7], and “ Chronic Extremity Joint Pain -Suspected Inflammatory Arthritis ” for patient with 
suspected arthritis  or synovitis [ 8]. 
Special Imaging  Considerations  
Knee radiographs  should include at least one frontal projection of one or both knees (anteroposterior, Rosenberg, 
or tunnel), a tangential patellar view , and a lateral view of the affected knee [2,9]. Standing radiographs more 
accurately reflect medial and lateral compartment cartilage loss than supine radiographs with the posteromedial and posterolateral joint compartments  more accurately assessed using a weight -bearing flexion posteroanterior 
radiograph [9,10].

agreement  that radiographs  should be obtained  and the clinical  decision  rule should not be applied  for patients with

or physical  examination  secondary  to multiple  injuries  [3,10] , altered  mental  status (eg, head  injury, drug or alcohol  
use, dementia)  [3,10] , neuropathy (eg, paraplegia,  diabetes)  [3,10] , or a history  suggesting  increased  risk of fracture.  
Additionally , in any case scenario,  the physician’s judgment  and common  sense should supersede clinical  guidelines  
[3]. 
Bone  Scan  with  SPECT  or SPECT/CT  Knee

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  hip pain is a common chief  complaint  for patients , reportedly affecting  30% to 40% of adults  who play 
sports  [1,2] , and 12% to 15% of all adults  over 60 [3,4] . A wide variety  of pathological  entities  may cause hip pain, 
including  osseous  as well as intra- or extra -articular  soft tissue abnormalities  [5-7]. Pathology  involving  the lumbar  
spine,  sacroiliac,  or knee  joints  can also cause hip pain [8], and these  etiologies  should  be investigated  as needed . 
There is limited  original  research  that specifically  targets the imaging  of chronic  hip pain,  but imaging  of specific  
conditions  is widely  discussed  in the published  literature. 
Before  imaging,  an appropriate  assessment  of a patient’s  clinical  history  and physical  examination  is essential  in 
trying  to pare down the range  of possible etiologies  for a patient’s  symptoms.

CT can also be helpful  
in identifying  extra-articular  impingement  (ischiopelvic,  ischiotrochanteric,  subspinous,  and femoropelvic)  [45,46] . 
Measurements can be performed  on radiography,  CT, and MRI [42-44,47,48] . Sometimes  limited  images  of the 
knees may be obtained  as part of the hip CT to evaluate for femoral  version;  occasionally  knee  pathology may be 
identified  on these images  as a possible  cause of the patient’s  hip pain [49]. 
Fluoride  PET/CT Skull Base to Mid-Thigh 
One study demonstrated  the potential use of fluoride  PET to demonstrate increased  bone  turnover  in the setting  of 
chronic  hip pain and FAI [50]. One other  study  demonstrated  that fluoride  PET can demonstrate acetabular  
contrecoup injuries  in patients  with FAI [51]. However,  increased  radiotracer  uptake  is a nonspecific  finding,  and, 
overall,  there is insufficient  literature  to support  the use of fluoride  PET/CT skull base to mid-thigh in the evaluation  
of chronic  hip pain thought  to be due to hip impingement  and/or  dysplasia.  
Image -Guided Anesthetic +/- Corticosteroid  Injection  Hip Joint  or Surrounding  Structures  
Fluoroscopic -, CT-, or US-guided anesthetic and/or  corticosteroid  injections  can be a useful  tool for clarifying  the 
source of a patient’s  chronic  hip pain.  In addition  to intra-articular  injections, selective trochanteric  and iliopsoas  
bursal/peritendinous  injections  can be performed  for both diagnostic  or therapeutic purposes  using anesthetic and/or

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Traumatic shoulder pain is shoulder pain believed to be directly attributed to a traumatic event, either acute or 
chronic. This pain may be the result of either fracture (the clavicle, scapula, or proximal humerus) or soft -tissue 
injury (most commonly of the rotator cuff, acromioclavicular ligaments, or labroligamentous complex). The 
incidence of traumatic shoulder injuries is difficult to determine because some injury types, such as low-grade 
acromioclavicular separations or acute rotator cuff tears, are likely under -reported because patients  do not seek 
immediate medical treatment. However, as with many traumatic injuries, traumatic shoulder pain tends to 
disproportionately involve young adults and male patients [ 1,2]. 
The etiology of traumatic shoulder pain can often be made based on clinical examination, radiographs, and 
mechanism of injury. Traumatic shoulder injuries can generally be separated into in juries requiring acute surgical 
management and injuries in which conservative management can be attempted prior to considering surgical 
treatment. Unstable or significantly displaced fractures and joint instability are injuries most likely requiring acute 
surgical treatment.

Variant 6: Traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs normal.  Physical examination and history consistent

Shoulder dislocation or instability is most co mmon in the anterior direction. Younger patients are more likely to 
have labroligamentous injury and persistent instability after dislocation compared with older patients [54]. Older 
patients are more likely to have rotator cuff tears in association with shoulder dislocation [ 55]. Coexisting 
humeral avulsion of the glenohumeral ligament and significant glenoid bone loss have been found in up to 10% of 
patients with recurrent shoulder instability [ 56], which underscores the need to assess both osseous and 
labroligamentous pathology in patients with shoulder dislocation or instability. Glenoid morphology and bone 
loss can play a significant factor in recurrent shoulder dislocations [15, 16,57], which may require bone grafting in 
order to restore stability [ 57].

Score: 0.686254979172779","condition: shoulder pain traumatic

Most soft -tissue injuries (such as labral tears and rotator cuff tears) can undergo a period of 
conservative management prior to considering surgery. However, in addition to the specific imaging findings 
related to a traumatic injury, indications and timing of surgical treatment of many traumatic shoulder injuries are 
dependent on patient age, comorbidities, current activity level, and expected activity level.

Variant 1:  Traumatic shoulder pain. Any etiology . Initial imaging . 
Radiography Shoulder  
Radiographs are the preferred initial study performed in the setting of traumatic shoulder pain . They can delineate 
shoulder malalignment and most shoulder fractures [ 4,5]. A standard set of shoulder radiographs for trauma 
should include at least three  views: anterior -posterior (AP) views in internal and external rotation and an axillary 
or scapula-Y view. Axillary or scapula-Y views are vital in evaluating traumatic shoulder injuries as 
acromioclavicular and glenohumeral dislocations can be misclassified on AP  views [6,7]. Radiographs provide 
good delineation of bony anatomy to assess for fracture and appropriate shoulder alignment, which are the two 
primary concerns in management of acute traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs should also be performed upright 
since malalignment of the shoul der can be under -represented on supine radiographs [ 4]. Additional views, such as 
the Bernageau view, have been sho wn to be effective in demonstrating the degree of bone loss of the glenoid or 
humeral head [ 8].

study. 
Appropriately positioned  radiographs can exclude shoulder dislocation and most displaced fractures as the 
etiology for post -traumatic shoulder pain. In the setting of normal shoulder radiographs, the most common causes 
of post -traumatic shoulder pain are soft -tissue injuries such  as rotator cuff and labral tears.  
MRI Shoulder  
Noncontrast MRI is a reasonable imaging study in the setting of acute nonlocalized traumatic shoulder pain and 
noncontributory radiographs. In the acute trauma setting, noncontrast MRI may be preferred to MR arthrography , 
as acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint effusion for assessment of intra -articular 
soft-tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic 
pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [34,35]. MRI is also sensitive for diagnosing bone marrow 
contusion and has  been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries in pediatric patients [ 36,37]. 
MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography has been found to be superior to noncontrast MRI in the diagnosis of labroligamentous and 
partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [17,19]. In the acute trauma setting, however, noncontrast MRI may be 
preferred to MR arthrography because acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint 
effusion for assessment of intra-arti cular soft -tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing 
extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [ 34,35]. MRI is also sensitive

ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 10 Shoulder Pain –Traumatic  US Shoulder  
There is no defined role for US  in evaluation of proximal humeral  fractures. Although fractures may sometimes 
be visible on US as areas of cortical interruption, US  is unable to reliably characterize fracture patterns. In ideal 
conditions, US is effective at identifying full-thickness rotator cuff tears that may be associated with humeral head 
fractures [17,22,44]. However, in the acute setting of humeral head fractur e, an US examination of the shoulder is 
significantly limited by decreased patient mobility and swelling. 
FDG -PET/CT  Skull Base to Mid-Thigh 
FDG-PET in combination with CT  has been shown to be reliable in differentiating benign from malignant 
pathologic fr actures [27]. FDG-PET/CT can be used to further assess suspected pathologic fractures of the 
proximal humerus.  
Bone Scan  Shoulder  
Bone scintigraphy has sensitivity and specificity comparable to MRI in diagnosis of occult bone fractures, and 
bone scintigraphy can be used  to identify other foci of bone involvement in pathologic fractures due to metastatic 
disease  [31,32]. Bone scintigraphy can be used  to characterize proximal humerus fractures suspected to be due to 
metastatic disease.  
Variant 4: Traumatic shoulder pain. Radio graphs show scapula fracture.  Next imaging study. 
There is no consensus on indications for surgical fixation of scapula fractures. In general, isolated scapula body 
fractures heal well without surgical fixation, although associated rib fractures or higher injury severity score are 
associated with worse clinical outcomes and may benefit from more aggressive surgical fixation [ 45]. Scapula 
fractures involving the glenoid articular surface or glenoid neck may also require surgical fixation.  
CT Shoulder  
Because of the scapula’s complex osteology and overlying ribs, scapula fractures can be easily missed or 
underappreciate on conventional radiographs.

radiographic  findings  can be diagnostic  or highly  character istic,  such as in the identification  of phleboliths  within  a 
hemangioma,  the osteocartilaginous  masses  of synovial  chondromatosis,  or the peripherally  more  mature

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
A variety  of benign and malignant  processes may present  clinically  as a soft tissue  mass.  The behavior  of a mass,  
whether  nonaggressive,  indeterminant,  or aggressive,  can often  be discerned  based  on history  and physical  
examination.  However,  when  a benign clinical diagnosis  cannot  be confidently provided,  further  characterization  
of a soft tissue mass  with imaging  is warranted  [1]. Urgent  imag ing requests should be sought  for masses  that are 
>5 cm in diameter,  deep  in location, or have  shown  rapid  growth [2]. Modern imaging  techniques  allow  for a 
detailed  analysis of the morphology  of a soft tissue mass  as well as further insight  into its biologic  activity , which  
informs  the interpreter  on diagnosis  and appropriate  next steps in management  [3,4].  
The purpose  of this document  is to identify  the most  appropriate  imaging  study(ies)  to order  for the assessment  of 
a soft tissue  mass  based  on the most  frequently encountered  clinical  scenarios in medical  practice.

Several  studies  have  attempted  to find size and 
morphologic  criteria  to help discriminate  between  malignant  and benign  pulmonary  nodules  [9,12] . Rissing  et al 
[55] showed  that those  only with pulmonary  lesions  <5 mm were  associated  with equivalent  survival  to those  with 
normal  scans.  Often  when  a pulmonary  metastasis  is identified  on a different  imaging  modality,  CT is then required  
for biopsy  or treatment  planning.  
Guidance  varies regarding  whether  to use CT chest  versus  chest  radiography  as surveillance  for lung metastases  in 
patients  with sarcoma.  Much  of the debate  also takes  cost-analysis  and radiation  exposure  into consideration.  A 
retrospective  study  by Cho et al [56] of 176 patients  with stage  II or stage  III high-grade  extremity  sarcomas  
calculated  similar  5-year survival  rates  whether  surveilled  with chest  radiography  or CT chest.  However,  when  
stratifying  survival  rates  by stage,  they found  a survival  benefit  for stage  III patients  when  monitored  with CT chest  
likely  related  to the increased  rates  of lung metastasis  with high-grade  sarcoma . Other  studies  have  differing  
conclusions.  A large  multicenter  retrospective  study  by Gamboa  et al [45] comparing  lung surveillance  in 909 
patients  with extremity,  truncal,  or retroperitoneal  high-grade  soft tissue  sarcomas  found  the 5-year survival  rate 
was noninferior  for patients  followed  with chest  radiography  versus  CT chest  (71%  versus  60%).  This study  also 
found  there  was no difference  in the rate or type of intervention  for these  lung metastases  when  detected.

US could  be used to evaluate  an 
area of interest  identified  clinically  or from  another  imaging  modality.  US is more  useful  to evaluate  superficial  soft 
tissue  masses  as opposed  to bone  lesions , which  are usually  occult  if there  is no cortical  breakthrough.  
Variant  3: Malignant  or aggressive  primary  musculoskeletal  tumor  with  no suspected  or known  recurrence.  
Surveillance  for pulmonary  metastasis.  
Pulmonary  metastases  account  for the majority  of distant  metastatic  disease  in patients  with primary  extremity  
sarcoma  as a whole.  Risk of pulmonary  metastasis  varies  with tumor  histology  and grade.  Although  patients  with 
high-grade  soft tissue  sarcomas  develop  lung metastasis  at a rate of ~60%,  those  with low-grade  sarcomas  have  
lung metastasis  rates  <10%  [45,46] . Therefore,  guidance  regarding  modality  for lung screening  often  differ  between  
low-risk and high-risk patients.  There  is also debate  concerning  the frequency  of lung surveillance.  Given  most  
pulmonary  metastases  will occur  within  2 years  of primary  resection  [47], many  experts  support  more  frequent  
surveillance  initially  in the first few years  after diagnosis.  Surveillance  regimens  usually  de-escalate  to annual  
follow -up after 5 years  postresection  [48-52].

Variant 1: Chronic foot pain. Unknown etiology. Initial imaging.  
Bone Scan Foot  
There is no relevant literature  to support t he use of nuclear medicine studies as the first imaging  study  in the 
evaluation of chronic foot pain.  
CT Foot  
There is no relevant literature to support the use of CT as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot 
pain.  
MRI Foot  
There is no r elevant literature  to support the use of MRI as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot 
pain.  
Radiography Foot  
Conventional radiography can be useful to distinguish among different causes of chronic foot pain and is usually 
the first imag ing study in evaluating patients with chronic foot pain.  
The value of radiographs in the diagnosis of tarsal coalitions has been extensively demonstrated. Overall 
sensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs 
in the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral 
and oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar 
coalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs 
on the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have 
been found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable 
methods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  
Radiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review 
by Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for 
radiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.  
Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain.

Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  
usually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, 
osteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite 
versus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess 
with radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton’s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other 
causes of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg’s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals 
or soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . 
Though radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in 
patients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The 
combination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a 
specificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15]. 
US Foot  
Ultrasound (US) is usually not indicate d as the first imaging  study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain, but may 
be performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of pathologic conditions of the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, 
and other conditions such as tarsal tunnel syndrome, Morton’s  neuroma , plantar plate tears,  and intermetatarsal 
bursitis. 
Variant 2: Persistent posttraumatic foot pain. Radiographs negative or equivocal. Clinical concern includes 
complex regional pain syndrome type I. Next imaging study.  
3-Phase Bone Scan Foot  
A 3-phase bone scan may be useful in cases of suspected complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type I reflex 
sympathetic dystrophy , and several imaging findings have been described.

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Acute injuries  to the foot are frequently  encountered  in the setting  of the emergency  room  and in general  practice.  
The clinical  indications  for imaging  (known as the Ottawa rules)  have  been  developed  to minimize  unnecessary  
radiographs , and their utility  is well documented by multiple  studies.  The most  commonly  accepted  form  of these  
rules is the following:  
A series of foot radiographs  is required  only if there  is pain in the midfoot  and any one of the 
following:  1) point  bone  tenderness of the navicular;  2) point  bone  tenderness of the base of the fifth 
metatarsal;  or 3) inability  to bear weight  or to walk  4 steps (immediately  after the injury  or at the 
emergency  department) .

ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 5 Acute Trauma to the Foot  US Foot  
A preliminary  US study  had less successful  results compared  with radiographic  evaluation,  with 90.9%  sensitivity  
and specificity  for detecting  fracture  [13]. In the presence of localized  tenderness,  one study  report ed US 
sensitivity  and specificity  of 100%  and 96% for fifth metatarsal  fractures and 40% and 93% for navicular  
fractures,  respectively  [23].  A recent  consensus  paper  from  European Society  of Musculoskeletal  Radiology  [14] 
assigned low grading scores for US assessment  of talus  and bony  avulsions.  
Variant  3: Adult  or child older  than  5 years of age. Acute trauma  to the foot.  Ottawa  rules cannot  be 
evaluated  due to exclusionary  criteria.  Initial imaging.  
Multiple  conditions  or scenarios preclude  the use of the Ottawa rules for determining  if imaging  is necessary  
[5,6] . It has been  reported  that the Ottawa rules  for the foot should not be used or should be used with great  
caution  in the following  clinical  situations:  penetrating  trauma,  pregnancy,  any skin wound,  transferred  with 
radiographs  already  taken,  >10 days after trauma,  a return  visit for continued  traumatic  foot pain,  in the setting  of 
polytrauma,  altered  sensorium,  neurologic  abnormality  affecting  the foot, or underlying  bone  disease [7]. 
Radiograph y Foot  
If a foot fracture is suspected  in a neurologically  compromised  patient, including patients  with diabetic  
neuropathy , the foot should  be radiographed.

Although there is no relevant literature  to support the routine clinical use of US in the 
diagnosis of CRPS type II, high-resolu tion US may have a role giving its increasing use in nerve assessment [23] . 
Variant 3: Chronic metatarsalgia including plantar great toe pain. Radiographs negative or equivocal. 
Clinical concern includes sesamoiditis, Morton’s  neuroma, intermetatarsal bursitis, chronic plantar plate 
injury, or Freiberg’s infraction. Next imaging study.  
Bone Scan Foot  
Planar b one scintigraphy has low anatomic resolution and has been shown to be a nonspecific technique to assess 
the hallucal sesamoids [24]. However, bone scintigraphy with single -photon emission computed tomography 
(SPECT)/CT increases contrast resolution and anatomic localization of foci with increased osteoblastic activity  
[25]. Bone scintigraphy may demonstrate increased uptake in pathologic conditions affecting the fir st metatarsal 
sesamoids not evident on radiographs. A less dramatic uptake is noted in stress fractures, which may be helpful to 
differentiate between them and acute fractures [26]. When an indeter minate linear lucency is visualized on 
radiographs, a negative bone scintigraphy suggest s sesamoid bipartition [12] . Other conditions that may present 
positive findings on Tc -99m -methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scint igraphy include sesamoiditis, 
inflammatory or deposition arthropathies, osteoarthritis , and osteonecrosis [39]. In Freiberg’s infraction, a 
photopenic center with a hyperactive collar may be identified on early stages on high -resolution Tc -99m -MDP bone 
scintigraphy [27]. 
CT Foot  
CT may be useful to confirm suspected sesamoid stress fractures on radiographs and to distinguish between a stress 
fracture and a bipartite sesamoid with more precision than conventional radiography [28] .

Score: 0.6934234016369991","condition: chronic foot pain

Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  
usually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, 
osteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite 
versus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess 
with radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton’s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other 
causes of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg’s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals 
or soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . 
Though radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in 
patients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The 
combination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a 
specificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15]. 
US Foot  
Ultrasound (US) is usually not indicate d as the first imaging  study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain, but may 
be performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of pathologic conditions of the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, 
and other conditions such as tarsal tunnel syndrome, Morton’s  neuroma , plantar plate tears,  and intermetatarsal 
bursitis. 
Variant 2: Persistent posttraumatic foot pain. Radiographs negative or equivocal. Clinical concern includes 
complex regional pain syndrome type I. Next imaging study.  
3-Phase Bone Scan Foot  
A 3-phase bone scan may be useful in cases of suspected complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type I reflex 
sympathetic dystrophy , and several imaging findings have been described.

Furthermore, certain athletic activities often result in specific sites of fatigue  fracture, such as olecranon process 
fractures in javelin throwers and baseball pitchers, proximal femur and tibial stress fractures in runners, and  tarsal  
navicular stress fractures in basketball players [ 36-38] . Correlat ion of  clinical history, pattern , and site recognition 
with radiographic findings  is usually specific [1,2,4,5,7]. Nevertheless, stress fractures are frequently occult on 
initial radiographs  [1], with conventional radiographs having a sensitivity of 15% to 35% [8]. Early radiographic 
findings are often nonspecific (subtle periosteal reaction , gray cortex sign) or even nonexistent. Late radiographic 
findings are often suggestive in appearance  and include  linear sclerosis (often perpe ndicular to the major 
trabecular lines), periosteal reaction , patchy endosteal sclerosis, and soft -tissue swelling . Additionally, 
radiographs may remain negative depending on the timing of re imaging , the patient’s metabolic bone status, and 
the type and lo cation of the fracture. Thus, radiographs are specific but significantly insensitive. Despite this 
limitation, all authorities agree that radiographs should be the initial imaging modality; if the findings are 
conclusive, no further imaging need be perform ed. 
Variant 2: S uspected stress (fatigue) fracture, hip. Negative radiographs. Next imaging study.

ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 10 Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture  Variant 5: Confirmed stress (fatigue) fracture, excluding vertebrae . Follow -up imaging study for  “return -
to-play” evaluation . 
See variants 1  through  3. On initial diagnosis, MRI can be used to  predict t ime to return to play in athletes. 
Fredericson et al  [48] retrospectively correlated return to activity with an MRI grading system based on the 
pattern of periosteal and marrow edema on T1-weighted  and fat -suppressed T 2-weighted sequences. Similar 
findings were confirmed in other studies  [49-51] , including  that the finding of abnormal cortical signal intensity 
or a fracture line was of prognostic value [ 51] and that MRI performed better in predicting return to activity than 
radiographs , bone scintigraphy, or CT [50,52]. 
A recent prospective study in university athletes found that MRI grading s everity, total-body bone mineral density 
evaluated by dual -energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and location of injury (ie , cortical or trabecular bone)  
were important variables for predicting time to full return to sport [ 31]. In this study, periosteal edema as 
described by Fredericson et al [ 48] was not associated with return to sport . Using the modified grading scale and a 
multiple regression model, for every 1- unit increase in MRI grade, the time to full return to sport increased by 
approximately 48 days [31] . Furthermore, trabecular st ress injuries (eg , femur neck and pubic bone ) were 
associated with a longer time to return to sport than cortical bone stress injuries. In addition, decreased bone 
mineral density leads to increased time to return to sport . Therefore, bone mineral density provides additional 
diagnostic and prognostic information [31]. The model of MRI  grade, trabecular versus cortical bone sit e, and 
total-body bone mineral density a ccounted for 68% of the variation in time to return to sport [ 31].

Finally, stress fractures of the femoral head are high  risk in healthy patients and , if not recognized promptly, have 
increased  rates of delayed union, nonunion, displacement, and avascular necrosis [17]. Given the importance of 
recognizing these high-risk fractures in the femoral head and neck, MRI is the preferred second -line study after  
initial negative  radiographs to prevent delayed diagnosis.  
Variant 3: Suspected stress (fatigue) fracture, excluding hip  and vertebrae. Negative radiographs. Next 
imaging study.  
See variant 2. Certain stress fractures are considered high  risk based on a tendency for nonunion or delayed union. 
High -risk stress fractures include the anterior tibial diaphysis, lateral femoral neck and femoral head (see variant 
2), patella, medial malleolus, navicular, fifth metatarsal base, proximal second metatarsal, tibial hallux sesamoid, 
and talus  [43]. 
The second -line test to diagnose a stress fracture should be guided by the location of the patient ’s pain and 
likelihood of high-risk injury. A follow -up radiographic examination has increased sensitivity compared to initial 
radiographs [8] but is less sensitive than MRI. MRI is extremely sensitive and demonstrates stress abnormalities 
as early as bone scintigraphy and with as much sensitivity [ 11-14]. The recent literature favors MRI as the 
procedure of choice for making an early diagnosis of both varieties of stress fractures [ 15-28 ]. MRI is also 
considerably more specifi c than bone scintigraphy [ 19,23]. Stress injuries in athletes that are not identified and 
managed in a timel y fashion can progress to more serious fractures. Preventive strategies, including identifying 
and modifying risk factors, may help deter progression to frank fractures [31,44,45]. 
A circumstance that deserves specific attention is the longitudinal stress fracture, particularly in the tibia. Up to 
25% may appear n ormal on radiographs, but CT or MRI findings are characteristic [ 13,46].

the injury, OR  2. Point tenderness over the medial malleolus, the posterior edge or inferior tip of the lateral 
malleolus, talus, or calcaneus, OR  3. Inability to ambulate for 4 steps in the emergency department.  
Variant 2: Imaging is usually not appropriate for patients 5 years of age or older with a cute trauma to the ankle 
when the patient is able  to walk  and there are no exclusionary criteria present (eg, neurologically intact (includ ing 
no peripheral neuropathy )) and  the OAR  are negative: No point tenderness over the malleoli, talus, or calcaneus on

Summary of Literature Review  
Introdu ction/Background 
Stress fractures occur in 2  varieties: 1) fatigue fractures result ing from repetitive submaximal stress on normal 
bone , resulting in a region of accelerated bone remodeling [ 1], and 2) insufficiency fractures due to normal 
activity on bones that are deficient in microstructure and/ or mineralization [ 2]. At the microscopic level, repetitive 
overloading leads to increased osteoclastic activity that exceeds the rate of osteoblastic new bone formati on. This 
results in bone weakening and microtrabecular disruption (stress injury) and eventually may lead to a cortical 
break (stress fracture). Stress fractures are encountered frequently and account for up to 20% of all injuries seen in 
sports medicine clinics  [3]. Stress fractures are particularly common in athletes participating in activities that 
require running and jumping, as well as in ballet dancers and military recruits [4,5].

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic foot pain is a frequent clinical complaint with approximately 14% to 42% of adults in the United States 
reporting foot problems, often with significant impact on mobility, difficulty performing daily activities , and 
increased risk of falling, particularly in older individuals [1,2] . Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a 
significant improvement in health-related quality of life with effective treatment of foot pain [3] . Estimating the 
prevalence of chron ic foot pain is challenging, because there is no consensus regarding the definition of chronic 
pain in the literature. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines chronic pain as any pain persisting 
past the normal healing time, suggesting 3 months in case of chronic pain of benign causes.  
Women are more commonly affected , and forefoot conditions are more frequent. Persistent pain for more than 6  
years has been reported in 51% of women between 70 to 75 years of age [4]. Because of  the wide range of causes 
of chronic foot pain, assessment of these patients with imaging studies in addition to a dedicated clinical 
examination is often needed [1] .

Radiography Foot  
Conventional radiography can be useful to distinguish among different causes of chronic foot pain and is usually 
the first imag ing study in evaluating patients with chronic foot pain.  
The value of radiographs in the diagnosis of tarsal coalitions has been extensively demonstrated. Overall 
sensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs 
in the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral 
and oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar 
coalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs 
on the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have 
been found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable 
methods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  
Radiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review 
by Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for 
radiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.  
Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain.

Bone Scan Foot  
Planar b one scintigraphy has low anatomic resolution and has been shown to be a nonspecific technique to assess 
the hallucal sesamoids [24]. However, bone scintigraphy with single -photon emission computed tomography 
(SPECT)/CT increases contrast resolution and anatomic localization of foci with increased osteoblastic activity  
[25]. Bone scintigraphy may demonstrate increased uptake in pathologic conditions affecting the fir st metatarsal 
sesamoids not evident on radiographs. A less dramatic uptake is noted in stress fractures, which may be helpful to 
differentiate between them and acute fractures [26]. When an indeter minate linear lucency is visualized on 
radiographs, a negative bone scintigraphy suggest s sesamoid bipartition [12] . Other conditions that may present 
positive findings on Tc -99m -methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scint igraphy include sesamoiditis, 
inflammatory or deposition arthropathies, osteoarthritis , and osteonecrosis [39]. In Freiberg’s infraction, a 
photopenic center with a hyperactive collar may be identified on early stages on high -resolution Tc -99m -MDP bone 
scintigraphy [27].

Thoracic and Lumbar Spine Imaging 
Injuries to the thoracolumbar spine are even more prevalent than cervical spin e injury, with an estimated 4% to 
7% of patients presenting to the emergency department  with blunt trauma sustaining a fracture of the 
thoracolumbar spine [13,14]. An increasing rate of t horacolumbar spine fractures h as been seen in the United 
States over the past several decades, despite a decline in other motor vehicle–related injuries [15]. While the exact 
reason for this increase is uncertain, it is likely due to a combination of both increased detection of thoracolumbar 
spine injury and increased rate of seatbelt injury. Similar to cervical in juries, there is a wide spectrum of 
thoracolumbar spine injuries ranging from stable, minor soft -tissue injuries to unstable fracture dislocations that 
are often accompanied by neurologic injuries. In contrast  to the cervical spine, there are no widely used and 
validated criteria to help determine if th oracolumbar spine imaging is appropriate. 
Clinical examination has a low to very low sensitivit y for identifying thoracolumbar spine injuries [16-18]. 
Therefore, a low threshold should be maintained for screen ing the thoracolumbar spine with imaging in the setting 
of blunt trauma, particularly in older patients, who are at increased risk for spine fractures occurring in the setting 
of low-energy trauma, such as a fall from standing (ie,  fragility fractures), which are due to diminished bone

cervical collar in place. 
Variant 9: Age greater than or equal to 16 years. Blunt trauma meeting criteria for thoracic and lumbar 
imaging. Initial imaging. 
Imaging is a crucial component in assessment of thoracic and lumbar spine injury. Fr om 1998 to 2011, there was 
an adjusted annual increase of approximately 8% in thor acolumbar spine fractures in patients involved in motor 
vehicle collisions [15]. Thoracolumbar fractures are cha llenging to identify clinically, with only 48% to 75% of 
thoracolumbar injuries identified on clinical examination [16-18]. Unlike cervical injuries, well-defined clinical 
criteria have not been established to determine when thor acolumbar imaging is appropriate in the setting of blunt 
traumatic injury. Since clinical examination has poor sen sitivity for identifying thoracolumbar injuries, any high-
risk patient (mid line thoracolumbar tenderness, high-energ y mechanism of injury, or >60 years of age), as well as 
unexaminable patients (intoxicated, GCS <15, distracting injury), should undergo imaging of the thoracolumbar 
spine. Screening of the entire spine is advised, as an es timated 20% of spine injuries will have a second associated 
spinal injury at a noncontiguous level [26,27]. 
Radiography  Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
It is well established that CT outperforms radiographs in  the diagnosis of thoracolumbar spine fractures [104-

82% sensitivity for identifying lumbar spine fractures [ 104,107,108] compared with the reported sensitivity of 
94% to 100% for identifying thoracolumbar spine fract ures using CT [104,107,108].

Summary of Literature Review 
Introduction/Background 
Cervical Spine Imaging An estimated 3% to 4% of patients presenting to the emer gency department with blunt trauma have sustained an 
injury to the cervical spine [1,2]. Cervical spine injuries can range from stable minor soft-tissue injuries to 
unstable complex injury patterns resulting in complete disr uption of the cervical spine with possible neurologic or 
vascular injury. The wide spectrum of injury patterns can make the decision process for when to perform imaging 
and what type of imaging to perform challenging. Over utilization of MRI and CT imaging of the cervical spine 
can result in an extended emergency center visit while aw aiting imaging as well as iatrogenic injuries related to 
prolonged cervical collar placement [3], exposure to in travenous (IV) contrast, and exposure to radiation and 
high-power magnetic fields. On the other hand, failure to  identify an unstable cervical spine or cervical vascular 
injury can result in poor clinical outcomes.

radiographs or noncontrast CT. Neurologic abnormalities. Next imaging study. 
CT Myelography Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
CT myelography can be performed to assess for traumatic spinal canal narrowing that is due to disc herniation or 
epidural hematoma and to assess for preganglionic nerve root avulsions. Ho wever, as with conventional CT, CT 
myelography is inferior to MRI in assessing cord contus ion, cord hemorrhage, and postganglionic nerve root 
injuries [40,41,43,57]. Performance of thoracolumbar CT myelogram can also be technically challenging, 
particularly in patients with suspected  unstable thoracolumbar spine injury. 
CT Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
CT does play a role in the initial assessment of thoracic and lumbar spine injury. However, CT is significantly 
inferior to MRI in identifying many soft-tissue pathologies,  such as cord contusion, epidural hematoma, and nerve 
root avulsions that can cause neurologic deficits re quiring surgical intervention [40,41,43,57]. Therefore, CT 
should not be considered adequate for excluding signifi cant soft-tissue pathology in patients presenting with 
thoracolumbar spine trauma and neurologic deficit. 
MRI Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
MRI should be performed in patients who have possible spinal  cord injury, in whom there is clinical concern for 
cord compression that is due to disc protrusion or hema toma, and in those suspected of ligamentous instability. 
MRI is valuable for characterizing the cause of myelopathy in  patients with spinal cord  injury. The severity of the 
injury—including extent of intramedullary hemorrhage , length of edema, and evidence of cord transection—
contributes to predicting outcome.

A comprehensive literature review of thoracolumbar trau ma was performed by Hsu et al [19] in 2003 with the 
conclusion that patients should undergo im aging of the thoracolumbar spine if  the following criteria were present: 
(1) back pain or midline tenderness, (2) local signs of thoracolumbar injury, (3) abnormal neurological signs, (4) 
cervical spine fracture, (5) Glasgow Coma  Scale score (GCS) <15, (6) major distracting injury, or (7) alcohol or 
drug intoxication. A prospective study by Holmes et al [20] of 152 patients with thoracolumbar spine injury in 2003 found 100% negative predictive value for thoracolumbar spine injury in patients not meeting any of the 
following criteria: (1) complaints of thoracolumbar spine pain, (2) thoracolumb ar spine tenderness, (3) a 
decreased level of consciousness, (4) intoxication with etha nol or drugs, (5) a neurologic deficit, or (6) a painful 
distracting injury. A prospective study of over 3,000 adult blunt trauma patients performed by Inaba et al [21] in 
2015 found 98.9% sensitivity for identifying patients with clin ically significant thoracolumbar spine injury using 
the following criteria: (1) positive physical examination (i ncluding neurologic deficit), (2) high-risk mechanism of 
injury, and (3) ≥60 years of age. It should be noted that in the study by Inaba et al, patients with altered 
consciousness (GCS <15), intoxication, or painful distrac ting injury were excluded from analysis because of their 
inability to perform an adequate examination necessitating imaging clear ance of the thoracolumbar spine. 
However, none of these 3 proposed criteria have  been validated independently (Table 4).

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
In the United  States,  acute low back  pain (LBP),  with or without radiculopathy , is the leading  cause of years lived  
with disability  and the third  ranking cause of disability -adjusted  life years  [1]. It is the fifth most  common  reason  
for a physician  visit in the United  States  and accounts for approximately  3% of visits  to the emergency  department  
[2]. 
The American  College  of Physicians and the American  Pain Society  classify  LBP into the following  broad  
categories:  nonspecific LBP, back  pain potentially  associated  with radiculopathy or spinal  stenosis,  and back  pain 
potentially  associated  with another  specific spinal  cause [3].

imaging  within  6 weeks after an initial visit for care for LBP versus  similar  patients who did not undergo early  
imaging  [9]. Additionally,  patients  with new episodes of LBP and previous  MRI scans are unlikely  to detect  changes  
in disc protrusion,  annular  fissures,  high-intensity  zones,  or end-plate  signal  changes with repeated  MRI [13].

In line with the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations for patients  
ages 65 and older being screened for osteoporosis, patients  >65 years of age may be considered at risk for 
osteoporotic fracture when presenting with LBP . 
Additionally,  for those  patients without  neurologic  compromise  and who present  with minor  risk factors for cancer,  
inflammatory  back  disease  (eg, ankylosing spondylitis), vertebral  compression  fracture,  or symptomatic  spinal  
stenosis,  imaging  should be considered  after a trial of therapy  [4]. 
In the majority  of patients, no specific pathology for LBP can be identified. Also,  studies have  shown  imaging  
abnormalities  in a substantial  number  of people  without back  pain [11-13]. The challenge for the clinician, therefore,  
is to distin guish the small  segment  within  this large patient  population that should be evaluated  further because of 
suspicion  of a more  serious  problem  or identify  pathology that requires intervention . 
Other  nonspine  causes of LBP can have overlap  in clinical  presentation,  including inflammatory  arthritis  and other  
systemic conditions , such as pelvic,  renal,  vascular,  or gastrointestinal  etiologies.  If an inflammatory  etiology  is 
suspected  as the cause of LBP, such as ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic  spondylitis, reactive arthritis, or 
inflammatory  bowel  disease– related  spine  disorders,  please see the ACR  Appropriateness Criteria® topic  on 
“Inflammatory Back Pain: Known or Suspected Axial Spondyloarthropathy ” [14].

A prospective  cohort  study of 20 patients  showed  no significant differences in MRI changes over 12 
months  in patients  presenting  with acute LBP compared  with their asymptomatic counterparts , except  in disc 
herniation,  nerve  root compression,  and annular  fissure [15]. Even  in the setting  of disc herniation,  imaging  may 
have  limited  role in management  as the majority  of disc herniations  show  some  degree of reabsorption  or regression  
by 8 weeks after symptom onset  [16]. It is important  to note that repeat  imaging  in patients  with new episodes of 
LBP and previous  MRI scans are unlikely  to detect  differences in disc protrusion,  annular  fissures,  high-intensity  
zones,  or end-plate  signal  changes [13]. 
Despite the lack of evidence to support  imaging early  or prior  to conservative treatment  for LBP, there is significant  
variation  in the ordering practices of physicians,  with nonadherance  to guidelines  leading  to increased  health  care 
utilization  [17,18] . A retrospective cohort  study of 145,320  patients ≥66 years of age  with acute nonspecific  LBP, 
revealed  27.2%  received  radiography  and 11.1%  received  CT or MRI within  4 weeks of the initial primary  care 
provider  visit [18]. A prospective  population-based  cohort  study  of 1,770 patients  with acute occupational  LBP 
showed  that 336 (19.0%)  received  lumbar  MRI within  6 weeks of presentation  (nonadherent  to guidelines).  This 
nonadherent  group had an increased  likelihood  of lumbosacral  injections  or surgery  for outpatient, inpatient, and 
nonmedical  services,  and disability  compensation  [17]. Increased  health  care utilization  with early  imaging  has also 
been  demonstrated  in nonworker  populations  [6].

Additionally,  guidelines  from  the American  College  
of Physicians and the American  Pain Society  [3,4]  emphasize a focused  history  and physical  examination,  
reassurance,  initial pain management  medications if necessary,  and consideration  of physical  therapies without  
routine  imaging  in patients  with nonspecific  LBP. Duration  of symptoms  also helps  guide  treatment  algorithms  in 
patients  with acute,  subacute,  or chronic  LBP. Additionally, assessment  of psychosocial  risk factors when  obtaining  
patient  history  is a strong predictor  of patients  who are predisposed  to developing chronic  disabling LBP problems  
[3]. 
Although there  is great  variability  in the definition  of acute and subacute  LBP, for the purposes  of this guideline,  
we will use the Institute  for Clinical Systems  Improvement  definitions  of 0 to 4 weeks to define  acute LBP,  4 to 12 
weeks for subacute LBP, and >12 weeks for chronic  LBP [5]. 
It is clear  that uncomplicated  acute  LBP and/or  radiculopathy is a benign,  self-limited  condition  that does not 
warrant  any imaging studies [4,6,7] . Imaging is considered  in those  patients who have  had up to 6 weeks of medical  
management  and physical  therapy  that resulted  in little or no improvement  in their back  pain.  It is also considered  
for those  patients  presenting  with red flags , raising  suspicion  for a serious underlying  condition,  such as cauda 
equina  syndrome  (CES),  malignancy,  fracture,  or infection  (see Table 1).

Summary of Literature Review  
Background/Introduction 
Chronic knee pain affects tens of millions of people  in the United States annually , with the pain sometimes highly 
disabling and often negatively impacting the patient’s quality of life. Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and 
it can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain 
with the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. 
Typically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain 
persists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  
imaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated 
that approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the 
prior year) radiographs [2 ]. 
This document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  ≥5 years of age.

CES is rare and results from  dysfunction of the sacral  and lumbar  nerve  roots  within  the vertebral  canal  secondary  
to cauda equina  nerve  root compression , producing impairment  of the bladder,  bowel,  or sexual  function and 
perianal  or saddle numbness.  Back  pain with or without  radicular  symptoms,  weakness in the lower  limbs, sensory  
changes or numbness  in the lower  limbs,  or absent  lower  limb reflexes are other  symptoms  that have  been  described  
[38]. A review of physical  examination  findings  reported  by Fairbanks  et al [39] found LBP as the most  common  
physical  finding in patients  with the diagnosis  of CES.  The most  common  cause of CES is lumbar  disc herniation  
at the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels.  Other  etiologies  include  neoplasm,  infection/inflammation, spinal  stenosis,  and 
hemorrhage.  
Multifocal deficits  and progressive neurologic  deficits can be caused  by a number  of other  noncompressive  
etiologies  with some  overlapping clinical  features.  Please see the ACR Appropriateness Criteria® topic on 
“Myelopathy ” for guidance  [40]. 
The imaging  study of choice in the evaluation  of suspected  CES, multifocal deficit, or progres sive neurologic  deficit

preferred  method for evaluation  of RA [18]. 
US has been  used to evaluate for osseous abnormalities  in the setting  of chronic  inflammatory  arthritis. Compared  
with radiography,  US has been  shown  to demonstrate a 6.5-fold  increase in the number  of detected  erosions of the 
metacarpophalangeal  joints  [12], but it is less accurate when  compared  with CT [11]. The f alse-positive  rate for US 
in detection  of metacarpophalangeal  joint erosions  has been  reported  as high as 29% [29]. Regardless,  large  erosions  
identified  with US at the second  and third  metacarpophalangeal  joints, the distal  ulna,  and the fifth 
metatarsophalangeal  joint are highly specific for and predictive  of RA [30]. US may also show  imaging  findings  
associated  with enthesitis  [25], with findings  of enthesitis  on power  Doppler  imaging  having  an accuracy  of 85.6% 
in distinguishing  peripheral  spondyloarthritis  versus nonspondyloarthropathy [31]. Studies  have  also found US to 
be helpful  in differentiating  RA and psoriatic  arthritis  [32,33] ; for example,  enthesitis  is a finding often  seen in 
spondyloarthritis  but not seen in RA. Increased  distance between  the nail and distal  phalanx in patients  with psoriatic  
arthritis  and cutaneous  psoriasis is reported  to have  an 80% sensitivity  and a 71% specificity  [34].

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
In the United  States,  acute low back  pain (LBP),  with or without radiculopathy , is the leading  cause of years lived  
with disability  and the third  ranking cause of disability -adjusted  life years  [1]. It is the fifth most  common  reason  
for a physician  visit in the United  States  and accounts for approximately  3% of visits  to the emergency  department  
[2]. 
The American  College  of Physicians and the American  Pain Society  classify  LBP into the following  broad  
categories:  nonspecific LBP, back  pain potentially  associated  with radiculopathy or spinal  stenosis,  and back  pain 
potentially  associated  with another  specific spinal  cause [3].

ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 6 Low Back  Pain Table  1. Red Flags : Indications  of a more  complicated  status  include  back  pain/radiculopathy  in the following  
settings  (adapted  from  Bigos et al  [8]). 
Red Flag  Potential  Underlying  Condition  as Cause  of LBP  
• History  of cancer  
• Unexplained  weight  loss 
• Immunosuppression 
• Urinary  infection  
• Intravenous  drug use 
• Prolonged  use of corticosteroids 
• Back  pain not improved with conservative  
management  • Cancer  or infection  
• History  of significant  trauma  
• Minor  fall or heavy  lift in a potentially  osteoporotic  
or elderly  individual  
• Prolonged  use of steroids  • Spinal fracture  
• Acute  onset  of urinary  retention  or overflow  
incontinence  
• Loss of anal sphincter  tone or fecal  incontinence  
• Saddle  anesthesia  
• Bilateral  or progressive  weakness in the lower  
limbs  • Cauda  equina  syndrome  or other  severe neurologic  
condition  
Previous  guidelines  have  suggested  that imaging  be performed  in adults  >50 years of age who present  with LBP. 
When  studied,  there was no statistically  significant  difference in primary  outcome  after 1 year for patients  aged  65 
years or older  who had spine  imaging  within  6 weeks after an initial  visit for care for LBP versus similar  patients  
who did not undergo early  imaging  [9]; thus,  this document  does not include  >50 years of age as an independent  
red flag. However, an important age-related risk factor for spinal fracture presenting as LBP  is osteoporosis.  As 
bone mass decreases slowly over time, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age, and differs by sex, race, 
ethnicity  [10], and comorbidities.

In line with the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations for patients  
ages 65 and older being screened for osteoporosis, patients  >65 years of age may be considered at risk for 
osteoporotic fracture when presenting with LBP . 
Additionally,  for those  patients without  neurologic  compromise  and who present  with minor  risk factors for cancer,  
inflammatory  back  disease  (eg, ankylosing spondylitis), vertebral  compression  fracture,  or symptomatic  spinal

In the majority  of patients, no specific pathology for LBP can be identified. Also,  studies have  shown  imaging  
abnormalities  in a substantial  number  of people  without back  pain [11-13]. The challenge for the clinician, therefore,  
is to distin guish the small  segment  within  this large patient  population that should be evaluated  further because of 
suspicion  of a more  serious  problem  or identify  pathology that requires intervention . 
Other  nonspine  causes of LBP can have overlap  in clinical  presentation,  including inflammatory  arthritis  and other

Radiculopathies  may result  from  compressive causes  related to narrowing of the neural foramina, such as by facet 
or uncovertebral joint hypertrophy, or from associated dis c bulging or herniation  and degenerative spondylosis  in 
the absence of a history  of diabetes or red flag symptom s [31].  A recent meta-analysis assessing the positive 
predictive value of physical examination tests in the setting of a clinical history of cervical radiculopathy 
concluded there was limited evidence for a correlation between physical examination findings and MRI evidence 
of cervical nerve root compression [32].  This may be due to a high rate of both false -positive and false-negative 
findings on MRI in the setting of suspected cervical radiculopathy [33 ]. Most cases of acute cervical neck pain 
with radicular symptoms resolve spontaneously or with conse rvative treatment measures [31, 34]. 
In absence of red flag symptoms, imaging may not be required at time of initial presentation [1 ] as spondylotic 
changes are commonly identified on radi ographs and MRI in patients >30 years of age and correlate poorly with 
the presence of neck pain [20-23]. Although the diagnostic accuracy of red flag symptoms is not validated for the 
cervical spine, the Bone  and Joint  Decade 2000 -2010 Task Force on Neck Pain and Its Associated Disorders [1] 
recommended the adoption of a similar system for cervical and neck pain, with red flags that include  trauma, 
malignancy, prior neck surgery, spinal cord injury, systemic diseases —inclu ding ankylosing spondylitis, diffuse 
idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, inflammatory arthritis, suspected infection —history of intravenous drug use, 
intractable pain despite therapy, or tenderness to palpation over a vertebral body. Additional proposed red flags include congenital findings, concomitant vascular disease in patients >50 years of age, abnormal labs (erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate, C -reactive protein level, white blood cell), and neurological deficits [10
].

The physical,  psychological , and socioeconomic  impact  of cervical  or neck  pain is extensive.  In 2010,  16.3 
million  health  care visits  to hospitals  and physician  offices were related  primarily  to neck  pain [1]. The Global  
Burden  of Disease 2010 Study  identified  neck  pain as the fourth  leading  cause of years lost to disability [2], with 
most  epidemiological  studies reporting an annual  prevalence ranging between  15% and 50% [3-8]. Although  most  
episodes resolve,  nearly  50% of individuals  continue  to experience ongoing or recurrent  pain [9].

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
In patients with chronic wrist pain, imaging studies are  an important adjunct to history, physical examination, 
laboratory testing, and electrophysiology studies. The choice of imaging modality depends on the patient’s 
presentation and the clinical questions being asked. There are scenarios in which no imaging beyond baseline 
radiographs is necessary, but in other situations advanced imaging has added value for diagnostic eva luation and 
treatment planning.  
Overview of Imaging Modalities  
Radiographs  
Imaging evaluation of the painful wrist should begin with radiog raphs [1,2]. This simple study may establish a 
specific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, 
impaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -
anterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or 
more oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling 
[3]. A v ariety of stress positions and maneuvers can be performed to elicit dynamic instability that is not visible 
on standard radiographs [ 4]. Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. 
Additionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ].

ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 11 Chronic Wrist Pain  CT Wrist  
While CT with IV contrast enhancement can depict abscesses, it is usually not appropriate  for evaluation of 
suspected wrist infections.  
CT Arthrography  Wrist  
CT arthrography is not routinely used to eval uate suspected wrist infection.  
US Wrist  
There may be a role for US in the staging of infections (for example, to delineate the location and e xtent of soft -
tissue abscesses) after aspiration has been performed.  Alternatively, US may be used in conjunction with 
aspiration as a method to first identify collections and then as the imaging method to guide aspiration.

Bone scan is not  routinely used to eval uate suspected chronic wrist infection.  
Arthrography  Wrist  
Radiographic arthrography  is not routinely used to eval uate suspected wrist infection.  
Variant 5:  Ulnar -sided chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or nonspecific . Next study.  
MRI Wrist  
Both traumatic and degenerative lesions of the TFCC can produce chronic, ulnar -sided wrist pain . MRI is highly 
accurate for lesions involving the radial (central) zone of the disc, especially with the use of high -resolution fast 
spin-echo or 3-D grad ient-recalled pulse sequences [36]. There is some evidence suggesting that MRI performed 
with a 3.0 T system is even more accurate than MRI performed with a 1.5 T system for TFCC lesions [37], but 
there are no studies comparing the accuracy of the two field s trengths in the same patients. The sensitivity for 
tears of the ulnar attachment of the disc and the peripheral attachments (the ulnocarpal ligaments) are only fair 
with noncontrast -enhanced wrist MRI [ 12,36]. IV contrast seldom provides added benefit in patients with ulnar -
sided wrist pain but may increase sensitivity for TFCC lesions if MR arthrography is desired but direct joint 
injection is not feasible.

both the flexor and extensor wrist compartments [46]. Occult ganglion cysts are also easily identified with MRI, 
but some authors recommend use of IV contrast to distinguish ganglia from synovitis [ 47]. For noncystic soft-
tissue masses, MRI may demonstrate findings that are diagnostic for certain benign conditions (eg, lipomas, 
hemangiomas, benign nerve sheath tumors), and can stage the extent of involvement for nonspecific masses ( see 
the ACR Appropriateness Criteria® topic on “ Soft-Tissue Masses ” [48]). 
US Wrist  
Wrist US or MRI (without or without  and with IV contrast) are alternative initial examinations that are usually 
appropriate in this setting. US  is useful for examining extra -articular soft tissue s, such as suspected ganglion cysts 
[17],  with an accuracy similar to that  of MRI.  
CT Wrist  
There is no support in the literature for CT in the initial diagnosis of a palpable mass or suspected ganglion cyst 
with normal or nonspecific radiologic findings. CT may have a role in cases in which calcification or ossification 
is demo nstrated radiologically, or in the staging of a lesion that is first evaluated by MRI or US , but CT with or 
without IV contrast are usually not appropriate initial examinations for a suspected soft -tissue mass.

prognosticate outcomes. In patients with early RA and other inflammatory arthritides , active synovitis may be 
better quantified following MRI with IV contrast administration, possibly  if performed dynamically, allowing 
confident early diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment guidance in these patients  [27,28]. Additionally, 
inflammatory tenosynovitis may be more conspicuous after IV  contrast administration [29]. As is the case for any 
tomographic study, MRI is much more sensitive than radiographs for identifying erosions in RA [30 ,31]. More

Immobility  predisposes  patients  to venous  thrombosis  and life-threatening  complications  such as 
pulmonary embolism  [101]. It can also lead to pressure ulcers,  pulmonary complications,  urinary  tract infections,  
and progressive  deconditioning.  Medical  management  is often  complementary  to other  treatment  strategies.  To 
reduce pain and thus promote  early  mobilization  with conservative management,  appropriate  analgesics should be 
prescribed . Narcotics should be reserved  for patients  who receive inadequate  relief  from  regular  analgesics and have  
to be used with caution  given  the associated  effects of sedation,  nausea,  further decrease in physical  conditioning,  
and fall risks.  Most  patients  with osteoporotic  VCF  have  spontaneous  resolution  of pain,  even  without medication,  
in 6 to 8 weeks [103,104,108,113]. Prevention  and treatment  of osteoporosis  are one of the first steps in managing  
VCFs.  Cigarette  smoking should  be discouraged,  and alcohol  should only be consumed  in moderation.  A daily  
weight -bearing  exercise program  should  be recommended  [101]. 
Patients  may not be candidates for percutaneous  or surgical  intervention  because of factors related  to performance  
status,  pregnancy,  infection, or coagulation disorders,  among others.  Clinical decision -making must  account  for the 
overall  risk and benefit  to the patient.

ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 8 Acute Trauma to the Foot  with a reported  90% sensitivity  for visualizing  wooden  foreign  bodies  in some  clinical  and experimental  studies 
[27,28] . US can be used effectively  to locate wooden foreign  bodies  as small  as 2.5 mm in length  [27]. However , 
some  experimental  studies  utilizing  soft-tissue phantom  models  report  lower  overall  sensitivity  (<50%)  for US for 
detection  of foreign  bodies  [25].  US can identify  a foreign  body  and can also help localize  it and determine if it 
involves  a tendon or a muscle  and to evaluate for an abscess.  
Summary  of Recommendations 
• Variant  1: Imaging is not recommended  for the initial imaging of an adult  or child  older  than 5 years of age 
with acute trauma  to the foot when  Ottawa rules  can be evaluated  without  exclusionary  criteria  and are 
negative  and there are no suspected  abnormalities  in regions  not evaluated  by the Ottawa rules.  
• Variant  2: Radiographs  of the foot, or when  a patient is able to tolerate,  radiographs  with weightbearing  of 
the foot are usually  appropriate  for the initial imaging  of an adult  or child  older  than 5 years of age with acute 
trauma  to the foot when  Ottawa rules  can be evaluated  without  exclusionary  criteria  and are positive. These  
procedures  are complementary  (ie, more  than one procedure  is ordered  as a set or simultaneously  in which  
each procedure  provides  unique  clinical  information  to effectively  manage the patient’s  care).  
• Variant  3: Radiographs  of the foot are usually  appropriate  for the initial imaging of an adult  or child  older  
than 5 years of age with acute trauma  to the foot when  Ottawa rules cannot  be ruled  out due to exclusionary  
criteria.

following  is present:  focal  tenderness,  effusion,  ability  to walk.  
• Variant  7: Knee radiographs  or CTA  lower  extremity  with IV contrast  is usually  appropriate  as the initial 
imaging study,  of patients  5 years of age or older,  for the evaluation  of significant  trauma  to the knee  (eg, motor

imaging study  of patients  5 years of age or older  for the evaluation  of significant  trauma  to the knee.  There is 
insufficient  medical  literature  to conclude  whether  or not these patients  would  benefit  from  CT knee  with IV

CT Myelography Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
CT myelography can be performed to assess for traumatic spinal canal narrowing that is due to disc herniation or 
epidural hematoma and to assess for preganglionic nerve root avulsions. Ho wever, as with conventional CT, CT 
myelography is inferior to MRI in assessing cord contus ion, cord hemorrhage, and postganglionic nerve root 
injuries [40,41,43,57]. Performance of thoracolumbar CT myelogram can also be technically challenging, 
particularly in patients with suspected  unstable thoracolumbar spine injury. 
CT Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
CT does play a role in the initial assessment of thoracic and lumbar spine injury. However, CT is significantly 
inferior to MRI in identifying many soft-tissue pathologies,  such as cord contusion, epidural hematoma, and nerve 
root avulsions that can cause neurologic deficits re quiring surgical intervention [40,41,43,57]. Therefore, CT 
should not be considered adequate for excluding signifi cant soft-tissue pathology in patients presenting with 
thoracolumbar spine trauma and neurologic deficit. 
MRI Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
MRI should be performed in patients who have possible spinal  cord injury, in whom there is clinical concern for 
cord compression that is due to disc protrusion or hema toma, and in those suspected of ligamentous instability. 
MRI is valuable for characterizing the cause of myelopathy in  patients with spinal cord  injury. The severity of the 
injury—including extent of intramedullary hemorrhage , length of edema, and evidence of cord transection—
contributes to predicting outcome.

Selection  
bias was a limitation  of both of these  retrospective  studies  because  the rationale  of which  modality  used to screen  
was not known  or reported.  Additionally,  the Gamboa  et al [45] study  included  151 patients  with retroperitoneal  
sarcoma , which  has a high rate of local  recurrence;  this group  was overrepresented  in the CT imaging  group , which  
had the worse  survival  rate. A prospective  randomized  trial of 500 patients  with resected  extremity  bone  and soft

FDG -PET/CT  Whole  Body  
Although  FDG -PET/CT  is not as sensitive  for detecting  pulmonary  metastases  as CT chest  imaging,  it has been  
shown  to be more  specific  and therefore  may be useful  as a problem -solving  tool when  an indeterminate  pulmonary  
nodule  is detected  on diagnostic  chest  CT. A study  comparing  staging  and follow -up imaging  studies  in 41 children

radiographs or noncontrast CT. Neurologic abnormalities. Next imaging study. 
CT Myelography Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
CT myelography can be performed to assess for traumatic spinal canal narrowing that is due to disc herniation or 
epidural hematoma and to assess for preganglionic nerve root avulsions. Ho wever, as with conventional CT, CT 
myelography is inferior to MRI in assessing cord contus ion, cord hemorrhage, and postganglionic nerve root 
injuries [40,41,43,57]. Performance of thoracolumbar CT myelogram can also be technically challenging, 
particularly in patients with suspected  unstable thoracolumbar spine injury. 
CT Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
CT does play a role in the initial assessment of thoracic and lumbar spine injury. However, CT is significantly 
inferior to MRI in identifying many soft-tissue pathologies,  such as cord contusion, epidural hematoma, and nerve 
root avulsions that can cause neurologic deficits re quiring surgical intervention [40,41,43,57]. Therefore, CT 
should not be considered adequate for excluding signifi cant soft-tissue pathology in patients presenting with 
thoracolumbar spine trauma and neurologic deficit. 
MRI Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
MRI should be performed in patients who have possible spinal  cord injury, in whom there is clinical concern for 
cord compression that is due to disc protrusion or hema toma, and in those suspected of ligamentous instability. 
MRI is valuable for characterizing the cause of myelopathy in  patients with spinal cord  injury. The severity of the 
injury—including extent of intramedullary hemorrhage , length of edema, and evidence of cord transection—
contributes to predicting outcome.

Imaging findings  such as disc space  
narrowi ng, vertebral  endplate  erosion , and gross  paraspinal  soft tissue changes that can be seen on radiography lag 
behind  the clinical  course of spine  infection  by at least 2 to 8 weeks [3,10,31] . Nevertheless,  the possi ble presence  
of one or more  of these findings  may increase the clinical  suspicion  for infection  and may help guide  subsequent  
imaging  management . Radiographs,  however,  provide  an overall  view of the status  and alignment  of the vertebral  
column and can be used to assess for spinal  instability  [8]. 
3-Phase  Bone  Scan  Complete Spine  
A 3-phase bone  scan with Tc-99m -methylene  diphosphonate  (MDP)  has variable moderate -to-high sensitivity  
(81.4%)  and low specificity  (40.7%)  for spine  infection  [31]. The advantages of skeletal  scintigraphy include  that 
it can be performed  and completed  in 1 day. Because  of the imaging  time required  for a 3-phase bone  scan,  it tends  
to be utilized  in select  situations  [3]. 
Gallium  Scan  Whole  Body  
Ga-67 scintigraphy combined  with single -photon emission  computed tomography  (SPECT)  can be used to evaluate  
suspected  spine  infection.  Ga-67 is less sensitive (73%)  but more  specific (61%)  than skeletal  scintigraphy [31]. 
The disadvantages of the gallium  examination  include  a requirement  for delayed  images (24 to 72 hours).  [31]. A 
Tc-99m -MDP  study can be combined with Ga-67 -citrate  in order  to improve  the overall  specificity  of the 
examination  (81%)  while  maintaining  a sensitivity  of 78% [31,36] .

bias was a limitation  of both of these  retrospective  studies  because  the rationale  of which  modality  used to screen

Potential adverse health  effects associated  with radiation  exposure  are an important  factor  to consider  when

population total radiation  risk associated  with an imaging  procedure.  Patients  in the pediatric  age group are at 
inherently  higher  risk from  exposure,  because of both organ sensitivity  and longer  life expectancy  (relevant  to the 
long latency  that appears to accompany  radiation  exposure).  For these reasons,  the RRL  dose estimate ranges  for 
pediatric  examinations  are lower  as compared  with those  specified  for adults  (see Table below).

[27,28] . US can be used effectively  to locate wooden foreign  bodies  as small  as 2.5 mm in length  [27]. However , 
some  experimental  studies  utilizing  soft-tissue phantom  models  report  lower  overall  sensitivity  (<50%)  for US for 
detection  of foreign  bodies  [25].  US can identify  a foreign  body  and can also help localize  it and determine if it

Summary  of Recommendations 
• Variant  1: Imaging is not recommended  for the initial imaging of an adult  or child  older  than 5 years of age 
with acute trauma  to the foot when  Ottawa rules  can be evaluated  without  exclusionary  criteria  and are 
negative  and there are no suspected  abnormalities  in regions  not evaluated  by the Ottawa rules.  
• Variant  2: Radiographs  of the foot, or when  a patient is able to tolerate,  radiographs  with weightbearing  of 
the foot are usually  appropriate  for the initial imaging  of an adult  or child  older  than 5 years of age with acute 
trauma  to the foot when  Ottawa rules  can be evaluated  without  exclusionary  criteria  and are positive. These  
procedures  are complementary  (ie, more  than one procedure  is ordered  as a set or simultaneously  in which  
each procedure  provides  unique  clinical  information  to effectively  manage the patient’s  care).  
• Variant  3: Radiographs  of the foot are usually  appropriate  for the initial imaging of an adult  or child  older  
than 5 years of age with acute trauma  to the foot when  Ottawa rules cannot  be ruled  out due to exclusionary  
criteria.

Several  studies  have  attempted  to find size and 
morphologic  criteria  to help discriminate  between  malignant  and benign  pulmonary  nodules  [9,12] . Rissing  et al 
[55] showed  that those  only with pulmonary  lesions  <5 mm were  associated  with equivalent  survival  to those  with 
normal  scans.  Often  when  a pulmonary  metastasis  is identified  on a different  imaging  modality,  CT is then required  
for biopsy  or treatment  planning.  
Guidance  varies regarding  whether  to use CT chest  versus  chest  radiography  as surveillance  for lung metastases  in 
patients  with sarcoma.  Much  of the debate  also takes  cost-analysis  and radiation  exposure  into consideration.  A 
retrospective  study  by Cho et al [56] of 176 patients  with stage  II or stage  III high-grade  extremity  sarcomas  
calculated  similar  5-year survival  rates  whether  surveilled  with chest  radiography  or CT chest.  However,  when  
stratifying  survival  rates  by stage,  they found  a survival  benefit  for stage  III patients  when  monitored  with CT chest  
likely  related  to the increased  rates  of lung metastasis  with high-grade  sarcoma . Other  studies  have  differing  
conclusions.  A large  multicenter  retrospective  study  by Gamboa  et al [45] comparing  lung surveillance  in 909 
patients  with extremity,  truncal,  or retroperitoneal  high-grade  soft tissue  sarcomas  found  the 5-year survival  rate

Selection  
bias was a limitation  of both of these  retrospective  studies  because  the rationale  of which  modality  used to screen  
was not known  or reported.  Additionally,  the Gamboa  et al [45] study  included  151 patients  with retroperitoneal  
sarcoma , which  has a high rate of local  recurrence;  this group  was overrepresented  in the CT imaging  group , which  
had the worse  survival  rate. A prospective  randomized  trial of 500 patients  with resected  extremity  bone  and soft 
tissue  sarcomas  without  baseline  metastases  showed  noninferiority  of chest  radiography  compared  with CT chest  
with similar  overall  survival  (56%  versus  53% respectively)  and recurrence -free survival  (59%  versus  54% 
respectively)  when  used for lung surveillance  [53,54] . 
FDG -PET/CT  Whole  Body  
Although  FDG -PET/CT  is not as sensitive  for detecting  pulmonary  metastases  as CT chest  imaging,  it has been  
shown  to be more  specific  and therefore  may be useful  as a problem -solving  tool when  an indeterminate  pulmonary  
nodule  is detected  on diagnostic  chest  CT. A study  comparing  staging  and follow -up imaging  studies  in 41 children  
with primary  bone  sarcomas  showed  greater  sensitivity  of CT chest  (93%)  versus  FDG -PET/CT  (80%)  in detecting  
pulmonary  metastases  (although  specificity  was higher  with FDG -PET/CT  at 96% compared  with 87% for CT 
chest).  Of the false -negative  FDG -PET/CT  results  in that study,  half were  pulmonary  nodules  <10 mm [15].

radiographs or noncontrast CT. Neurologic abnormalities. Next imaging study. 
CT Myelography Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
CT myelography can be performed to assess for traumatic spinal canal narrowing that is due to disc herniation or 
epidural hematoma and to assess for preganglionic nerve root avulsions. Ho wever, as with conventional CT, CT 
myelography is inferior to MRI in assessing cord contus ion, cord hemorrhage, and postganglionic nerve root 
injuries [40,41,43,57]. Performance of thoracolumbar CT myelogram can also be technically challenging, 
particularly in patients with suspected  unstable thoracolumbar spine injury. 
CT Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
CT does play a role in the initial assessment of thoracic and lumbar spine injury. However, CT is significantly 
inferior to MRI in identifying many soft-tissue pathologies,  such as cord contusion, epidural hematoma, and nerve 
root avulsions that can cause neurologic deficits re quiring surgical intervention [40,41,43,57]. Therefore, CT 
should not be considered adequate for excluding signifi cant soft-tissue pathology in patients presenting with 
thoracolumbar spine trauma and neurologic deficit. 
MRI Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
MRI should be performed in patients who have possible spinal  cord injury, in whom there is clinical concern for 
cord compression that is due to disc protrusion or hema toma, and in those suspected of ligamentous instability. 
MRI is valuable for characterizing the cause of myelopathy in  patients with spinal cord  injury. The severity of the 
injury—including extent of intramedullary hemorrhage , length of edema, and evidence of cord transection—
contributes to predicting outcome.

Summary  of Recommendations  
• Variant  1: CT chest  without  IV contrast  is usually  appropriate  for the initial  staging  of malignant  or aggressive  
primary  musculoskeletal  tumors  in the evaluation  of pulmonary  metastases.  
• Variant  2: FDG -PET/CT  whole  body  is usually  appropriate  for the initial  staging  of malignant  or aggressive  
primary  musculoskeletal  tumors  in the evaluation  of extrapulmonary  metastases.  Although  the panel  did not 
agree  on recommending  MRI whole  body  without  IV contrast  or fluoride  PET/CT  whole  body,  because  there  
is insufficient  medical  literature  to conclude  whether  these  patients  would  benefit  from  the procedure,  its use 
may be appropriate.   
• Variant  3: CT chest  without  IV contrast  is usually  appropriate  for surveillance  of pulmonary  metastasis  in 
patients  with malignant  or aggressive  primary  musculoskeletal  tumors  with no suspected  or known  recurrence.  
• Variant  4: Radiography  area of interest , combined  with MRI  area of interest  without  and with IV contrast  or 
MRI  area of interest  without  IV contrast  are usually  appropriate  for surveillance  of local  recurrence  in patients  
with malignant  or aggressive  primary  bone  tumors.  These  procedures  are complementary,  and both are indicated  
in this patient  population.

The variants  
in this document  assume  a diagnosis  of a primary  malignant  or aggressive  bone  or soft tissue  tumor  has already  
been  established.  This document  does not address  the evaluation  of chemotherapy  or radiation  therapy  effectiveness  
or issues  of cost-effectiveness  and radiation  dose.  
Special  Imaging  Considerations  
Hardware  reconstruction  is often  needed  following  limb-sparing  surgery  for the management  of bone  tumors  and 
occasionally  for soft tissue  tumors.  This hardware  creates  artifact  and limits  evaluation  of the adjacent  structures  
with traditional  CT, PET/CT , and MRI  sequences  and techniques.  Although  metal  artifact  can negatively  impact  
CT, PET/CT , and/or  MRI  image  quality,  this document  assumes  metal  artifact  can be minimized  with current  metal  
artifact  reduction  protocols.  There  may still be instances  where  metal  artifact  cannot  be sufficiently  suppressed,  and 
CT, PET/CT , and/or  MRI  become  of limited  benefit . In these  cases,  deviations  from  the variant  recommendations  
may be necessary  and should  be informed  by the clinical  experience  and expertise  of the treatment  team.

When  studied,  there was no statistically  significant  difference in primary  outcome  after 1 year for patients  aged  65 
years or older  who had spine  imaging  within  6 weeks after an initial  visit for care for LBP versus similar  patients

bone mass decreases slowly over time, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age, and differs by sex, race,

CT Myelography Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
CT myelography can be performed to assess for traumatic spinal canal narrowing that is due to disc herniation or 
epidural hematoma and to assess for preganglionic nerve root avulsions. Ho wever, as with conventional CT, CT 
myelography is inferior to MRI in assessing cord contus ion, cord hemorrhage, and postganglionic nerve root 
injuries [40,41,43,57]. Performance of thoracolumbar CT myelogram can also be technically challenging, 
particularly in patients with suspected  unstable thoracolumbar spine injury. 
CT Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
CT does play a role in the initial assessment of thoracic and lumbar spine injury. However, CT is significantly 
inferior to MRI in identifying many soft-tissue pathologies,  such as cord contusion, epidural hematoma, and nerve 
root avulsions that can cause neurologic deficits re quiring surgical intervention [40,41,43,57]. Therefore, CT 
should not be considered adequate for excluding signifi cant soft-tissue pathology in patients presenting with 
thoracolumbar spine trauma and neurologic deficit. 
MRI Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
MRI should be performed in patients who have possible spinal  cord injury, in whom there is clinical concern for 
cord compression that is due to disc protrusion or hema toma, and in those suspected of ligamentous instability. 
MRI is valuable for characterizing the cause of myelopathy in  patients with spinal cord  injury. The severity of the 
injury—including extent of intramedullary hemorrhage , length of edema, and evidence of cord transection—
contributes to predicting outcome.

Selection  
bias was a limitation  of both of these  retrospective  studies  because  the rationale  of which  modality  used to screen  
was not known  or reported.  Additionally,  the Gamboa  et al [45] study  included  151 patients  with retroperitoneal  
sarcoma , which  has a high rate of local  recurrence;  this group  was overrepresented  in the CT imaging  group , which  
had the worse  survival  rate. A prospective  randomized  trial of 500 patients  with resected  extremity  bone  and soft 
tissue  sarcomas  without  baseline  metastases  showed  noninferiority  of chest  radiography  compared  with CT chest  
with similar  overall  survival  (56%  versus  53% respectively)  and recurrence -free survival  (59%  versus  54% 
respectively)  when  used for lung surveillance  [53,54] . 
FDG -PET/CT  Whole  Body  
Although  FDG -PET/CT  is not as sensitive  for detecting  pulmonary  metastases  as CT chest  imaging,  it has been  
shown  to be more  specific  and therefore  may be useful  as a problem -solving  tool when  an indeterminate  pulmonary  
nodule  is detected  on diagnostic  chest  CT. A study  comparing  staging  and follow -up imaging  studies  in 41 children  
with primary  bone  sarcomas  showed  greater  sensitivity  of CT chest  (93%)  versus  FDG -PET/CT  (80%)  in detecting  
pulmonary  metastases  (although  specificity  was higher  with FDG -PET/CT  at 96% compared  with 87% for CT 
chest).  Of the false -negative  FDG -PET/CT  results  in that study,  half were  pulmonary  nodules  <10 mm [15].

Immobility  predisposes  patients  to venous  thrombosis  and life-threatening  complications  such as 
pulmonary embolism  [101]. It can also lead to pressure ulcers,  pulmonary complications,  urinary  tract infections,  
and progressive  deconditioning.  Medical  management  is often  complementary  to other  treatment  strategies.  To 
reduce pain and thus promote  early  mobilization  with conservative management,  appropriate  analgesics should be 
prescribed . Narcotics should be reserved  for patients  who receive inadequate  relief  from  regular  analgesics and have  
to be used with caution  given  the associated  effects of sedation,  nausea,  further decrease in physical  conditioning,  
and fall risks.  Most  patients  with osteoporotic  VCF  have  spontaneous  resolution  of pain,  even  without medication,  
in 6 to 8 weeks [103,104,108,113]. Prevention  and treatment  of osteoporosis  are one of the first steps in managing  
VCFs.  Cigarette  smoking should  be discouraged,  and alcohol  should only be consumed  in moderation.  A daily  
weight -bearing  exercise program  should  be recommended  [101]. 
Patients  may not be candidates for percutaneous  or surgical  intervention  because of factors related  to performance  
status,  pregnancy,  infection, or coagulation disorders,  among others.  Clinical decision -making must  account  for the 
overall  risk and benefit  to the patient.

This physical  
deconditioning,  in turn, may prompt  further complications  related  to poor inspiratory  effort  (ie, atelectasis and 
pneumonia)  [1] and venous  stasis (ie, deep  venous  thrombosis  and pulmonary embolism)  [2]. Successful  and timely  
management  of painful  VCFs can improve  quality  of life, increase the likelihood  of an independent  and productive  
life, and prevent  superimposed  medical  complications.  
This document  addresses the management  of both osteoporotic  and pathologic  VCFs.  
Comprehensive  medical  management  involves  appropriate  osteoporos is screening  and follow -up treatment  (see the 
ACR  Appropriateness  Criteria® topic  on “Osteoporosis and Bone  Mineral  Density ” [3]). The postmenopausal  
female population is most  at risk for developing osteoporotic  fractures of any type,  and VCFs comprise  25% of 
osteoporotic  fractures [4-6]. However,  there is also an increased  incidence of osteoporosis-related  fragility  fractures  
in males [7], with a lack of widespread  awareness of the risk of osteoporosis  in men currently  comparable to that of 
osteoporosis  in women  30 years ago [8]. In the setting  of “red flags” (see Appendix  1), the initial evaluation  of a 
painful  VCF  includes  assessing  any neurologic  deficits  and evaluating  mechanical  versus radicular  pain.  
Subsequently,  imaging  of the affected  spinal  segment  is performed  to characterize  the fracture  and to determine the 
extent  of disease.

Several  studies  have  attempted  to find size and 
morphologic  criteria  to help discriminate  between  malignant  and benign  pulmonary  nodules  [9,12] . Rissing  et al 
[55] showed  that those  only with pulmonary  lesions  <5 mm were  associated  with equivalent  survival  to those  with 
normal  scans.  Often  when  a pulmonary  metastasis  is identified  on a different  imaging  modality,  CT is then required  
for biopsy  or treatment  planning.  
Guidance  varies regarding  whether  to use CT chest  versus  chest  radiography  as surveillance  for lung metastases  in 
patients  with sarcoma.  Much  of the debate  also takes  cost-analysis  and radiation  exposure  into consideration.  A 
retrospective  study  by Cho et al [56] of 176 patients  with stage  II or stage  III high-grade  extremity  sarcomas  
calculated  similar  5-year survival  rates  whether  surveilled  with chest  radiography  or CT chest.  However,  when  
stratifying  survival  rates  by stage,  they found  a survival  benefit  for stage  III patients  when  monitored  with CT chest  
likely  related  to the increased  rates  of lung metastasis  with high-grade  sarcoma . Other  studies  have  differing  
conclusions.  A large  multicenter  retrospective  study  by Gamboa  et al [45] comparing  lung surveillance  in 909 
patients  with extremity,  truncal,  or retroperitoneal  high-grade  soft tissue  sarcomas  found  the 5-year survival  rate 
was noninferior  for patients  followed  with chest  radiography  versus  CT chest  (71%  versus  60%).  This study  also 
found  there  was no difference  in the rate or type of intervention  for these  lung metastases  when  detected.
