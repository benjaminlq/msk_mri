Prior to the advent of MRI, a bone scan was the preferred test for radiographically occult proximal femoral 
fractures. However, as early as 1993 , Rizzo et al [50] demonstrated MRI to be at least as accurate as bone scan s 
and with substantially decreased time to diagnosis. A later study by  Rubin et al [51] comparing bone scan s and 
MRI demonstrated i mproved sensitivity and specificity of MRI relative to bone scans . Moreover, t he bone scan 
group averaged an additional day to surgery.  
Bone scintigraphy is a time-consuming process. Bone scans may be falsely negative for up to 72 hours from the 
time of in jury, and false-positive scans are likewise common, related to osteoarthritis, soft -tissue injury , or any 
other process that may increase bone turnover [50] . It has been postulated that performing single -photon emission 
computed tomography may combine the sensitivity of bone scintig raphy with the spatial accuracy of CT , but there 
are no data to support this view. In current practice, the role of bone scan s as a secondary line of imaging in 
patients with contraindications to MRI has largely been usurped by CT.  
Summary of Recommendations 
• Variant 1:  Radiographs  of the hip, radiographs  of the pelvis, or radiographs  of the pelvis and hips is usually 
appropriate for the initial imaging of the hip with acute pain, fall or minor trauma, and suspected fracture.  
• Variant 2:  MRI pelv is and affected hip without IV contrast  or CT pelvis and hips without IV contrast is 
usually appropriate as the next imaging study for the evaluation of a cute hip pain from a fall or minor trauma

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Fractures of the proximal femur (commonly referred to as hip fractures)  are a frequent  source of morbidity and 
mortality in elderly osteoporotic patients [1]. Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type 
result in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men 
[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs 
will continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of 
life following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays 
in diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -
and long-term mortality [6-13]. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of hip fractures is critical.

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  elbow  pain is a common  patient  complaint  in the primary  care setting. Patients  may report  symptoms  of 
swelling,  pain,  restricted  range  of motion,  stiffness,  and numbness  or tingling  [1]. There is a wide  differential  
diagnosis  for chronic  elbow  pain, including osseous,  soft tissue,  cartil aginous , and nerve -related  abnormalities.  
Epicondylalgia , caused  by tendinosis  of the common  extensor  tendon laterally  (“tennis elbow”)  or medially  the 
common  flexor  tendon  (“golfer’s  elbow ”), is the most  common  cause of chronic  elbow  pain,  estimated  to occur in 
1% to 3% of the population  [2]. Epicondylalgia  is associated  with lost workdays  and a significant  economic  burden  
[3].

The body regions covered in this clinical scenario are the sacroiliac joints, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine. 
These body regions might be evaluated separately or in combination as guided by physical examination findings,

Bone  Scan  with  SPECT  or SPECT/CT  Spine  Area  of Interest  
Bone  scintigraphy is not routinely  suggested  in the evaluation  of patients  with suspected  axSpA  because of  its lack 
of established  diagnostic  utility  [22]. Conventional  bone  scintigraphy has low to moderate sensitivity  and variable  
specificity  for the diagnosis  of axSpA  [41,42,50] . If bone  scintigraphy is used,  because of  the complexity  of the 
spine anatomy,  the use of SPECT should be performed  during  the examination  [51]. Although  bone  scintigraphy is 
not typically  performed  during the evaluation  of suspected  axSpA  because of  its limited  diagnostic  utility, there is 
recent  data that hybrid SPECT/CT has higher  sensitivity  than conventional  bone  scintigraphy in the detection  of 
sacroiliitis  [52,53] , although  there  is not enough evidence at this time to support  its routine  use for evaluating  the 
sacroiliac joints  or spine . 
CT Spine  Area  of Interest  
CT demonstrates structural  changes in the spine  that may not be apparent  on radiographs  [22], including structural  
changes such as erosions,  sclerosis,  bone  formation,  syndesmophytes,  and ankyloses  [49,54] .

Page Content: MRI Spine  Area  of Interest  
Although MRI  of the sacroiliac joints  has high utility  for the diagnosis  of axSpA,  some  patients  will not demonstrate  
imaging  features of axSpA  in the sacroiliac joints  on MRI as indicated  by sensitivities  of all studies to varying 
degrees below  100%  [22], and therefore  some  patients may need  further imaging  evaluation  with MRI given that it 
is the imaging  modality  of choice for the diagnosis  of axSpA  [1,3,19,22] . Studies  have  shown  widely varying  
degrees of isolated  spinal  involvement  on MRI in axSpA  ranging from  1% to 49% [19,59-63,114,115] . Therefore,  
imag ing of the spine  is beneficial  for patients  in whom  there is suspicion  for axSpA  but imaging  of the sacroiliac 
joints  has been  negative.  Some  authors  have  shown  the utility  of using  whole -spine  or whole -body  MRI to identify  
the burden of disease rather  than selecting  specific areas of the spine  to image  because findings  may be potentially  
isolated  to any portion of the spine  [10,59,63,89,114,120-122] . 
The spine  MRI  findings  of axSpA  include  the active inflammatory  changes of spondylitis  and spondylodiscitis,  the 
inflammatory  changes of the costovertebral  joints,  costotransverse joints,  and facet  joints  and areas of enthesitis

MRI of the sacroiliac  joints.  Next  imaging  study.  
The body regions covered in this clinical scenario are the sacroiliac joints, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine. 
These body regions might be evaluated separately or in combination as guided by physical examination findings, 
patient history, and other available information. 
 
Bone  Scan  with  SPECT  or SPECT/CT  Spine  Area  of Interest  
Bone  scintigraphy is not routinely  suggested  in the evaluation  of patients  with suspected  axSpA  because of  its lack 
of established  diagnostic  utility  [22]. Conventional  bone  scintigraphy has low to moderate sensitivity  and variable  
specificity  for the diagnosis  of axSpA  [41,42,50] . If bone  scintigraphy is used,  because of  the complexity  of the 
spine anatomy,  the use of SPECT should be performed  during  the examination  [51]. Although  bone  scintigraphy is 
not typically  performed  during the evaluation  of suspected  axSpA  because of  its limited  diagnostic  utility, there is 
recent  data that hybrid SPECT/CT has higher  sensitivity  than conventional  bone  scintigraphy in the detection  of 
sacroiliitis  [52,53] , although  there  is not enough evidence at this time to support  its routine  use for evaluating  the 
sacroiliac joints  or spine . 
CT Spine  Area  of Interest  
CT demonstrates structural  changes in the spine  that may not be apparent  on radiographs  [22], including structural  
changes such as erosions,  sclerosis,  bone  formation,  syndesmophytes,  and ankyloses  [49,54] .

Page Content: Although  there is 
agreement  in the literature  and among experts that MRI should include  the sacroiliac  joints, there is not a 
consistently  established  convention  to guide  the clinician  on whether  to image  only the sacroiliac joints  or both the 
sacroiliac joints  and the spine  in patients  with suspected  axSpA  [1,3,19,22] . Not unexpectedly,  there  is heterogeneity  
in clinical  practice  regarding the use of MRI to evaluate the sacroiliac joints  and/or  spine  in these patients  [112] . 
One study has shown  that the majority  of patients  can be diagnosed with axSpA  by obtaining MRI of the sacroiliac  
joints only [60]. Another  study shows that the addition  of spine  MRI  to sacroiliac joint MRI adds little incremental  
value  in the diagnosis  of nonradiographic  axSpA  [113] . However,  axSpA  often  involves  the axial  skeleton  proximal  
to the sacroiliac joints  and may exhibit  findings  isolated  to the spine.  For example,  in a study of whole -body MRI  
in active axSpA,  99% of patients  were  found to have  active inflammatory  lesions  in the axial  skeleton,  with 
inflammatory  changes isolated  to the sacroiliac joints  in 52% of patients,  inflammatory  changes isolated  to the spine  
in 5% of patients , and with inflammatory  changes at both the sacroiliac joints  and spine  in 41% of patients  [59]. 
Other  studies have  shown  widely  varying degrees of isolated  spinal  involvement  on MRI ranging from  1% to 49% 
[19,60- 63,114,115] . In early  axSpA,  it has been  shown  that inflammation  involving  both the sacroiliac joints  and 
spine  can be seen in 28.3%  of patients  [116] .

Page Content: MRI Spine  Area  of Interest  
Although MRI  of the sacroiliac joints  has high utility  for the diagnosis  of axSpA,  some  patients  will not demonstrate  
imaging  features of axSpA  in the sacroiliac joints  on MRI as indicated  by sensitivities  of all studies to varying 
degrees below  100%  [22], and therefore  some  patients may need  further imaging  evaluation  with MRI given that it 
is the imaging  modality  of choice for the diagnosis  of axSpA  [1,3,19,22] . Studies  have  shown  widely varying  
degrees of isolated  spinal  involvement  on MRI in axSpA  ranging from  1% to 49% [19,59-63,114,115] . Therefore,  
imag ing of the spine  is beneficial  for patients  in whom  there is suspicion  for axSpA  but imaging  of the sacroiliac 
joints  has been  negative.  Some  authors  have  shown  the utility  of using  whole -spine  or whole -body  MRI to identify  
the burden of disease rather  than selecting  specific areas of the spine  to image  because findings  may be potentially  
isolated  to any portion of the spine  [10,59,63,89,114,120-122] . 
The spine  MRI  findings  of axSpA  include  the active inflammatory  changes of spondylitis  and spondylodiscitis,  the 
inflammatory  changes of the costovertebral  joints,  costotransverse joints,  and facet  joints  and areas of enthesitis

There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of whole -body FDG-PET/CT in the evaluation  of new or

MRI Lumbar Spine With IV Contrast  
MRI lumbar  spine  with IV contrast  is not typically  performed  independently as an initial study,  as its interpretation  
is most  informative  when  correlated  with standard  noncontrast  sequences included in MRI lumbar  spine  with and 
without  IV contrast  [33]. 
MRI Lumbar Spine Without and With IV Contrast  
MRI lumbar  spine  without  and with IV contrast  is useful  as it accurately  distinguishes  recurrent  or residual  disc 
herniations  from  scar, and can evaluate for nerve  root compression  or arachnoiditis  in patients  with new or 
progressive  symptoms  and previous  lumbar  surgery  [43]. It can also help identify  and evaluate extent  of infection .

Radiography Lumbar  Spine  
Radiography  is helpful  to evaluate alignment  and hardware integrity  in patients  with new or progressing  symptoms  
and previous  lumbar  fusion.  Upright  radiographs  provide  useful  functional  information  about  axial  loading.  Flexion  
and extension  radiographs  can be used to look for abnormal  motion/increased  dynamic  mobility  [50].

Page Content: In the presence of red flag 
conditions  (diabetes mellitus, IV drug use, cancer,  HIV,  or dialysis)  or abnormal  lab values,  imaging  may be 
indicated  if there  is a clinical  suspicion  for spine  infection  in a patient  with neck  or back  pain with or without fever.  
Clinically, it may be difficult  to differentiate  spine  infection  from  other  causes of neck  or back  pain such as 
degenerative disease,  trauma,  inflammatory  spondyloarthropathy,  or neoplastic involvement  of the spine  [3,35,55] . 
As any one of these clinical entities  has the potential to mimic  the imaging  appearance of spine  infection, it is 
important  to use the combination of clinical  presentation,  laboratory values such as an elevated  ESR and CRP  and 
imaging  findings  in order  to consider  the diagnosis  of spine  infection  [8]. 
The body regions  covered  in this clinical  scenario  are the cervical,  thoracic,  and lumbar  spine.  These body regions  
might  be evaluated  separately  or in combination as guided by physical  examination  findings,  patient  history, and 
other  available information.  
CT Spine  Area  of Interest  
As a result  of its excellent  delineation  of osseous detail  and greater  sensitivity  than radiography,  CT can be used in 
the evaluation  of spine  infection  [3]. The addition  of IV contrast  increases the conspicuity of paraspinal  soft tissue  
abnormalities, such as inflammation  or abscess  that may be caused  by infection. In those  cases  in which  a contrast -
enhanced  CT is to be performed,  it is not necessary  or useful  to perform  a noncontrast -enhanced  CT first, because  
this latter  examination  does not add more  diagnostic  information . The sensitivity  and specificity  of CT for spine  
infection  is 79% and 100%,  respectively  [33].
