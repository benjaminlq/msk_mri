Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 12 Shoulder Pain –Traumatic  MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography is the preferred exam ination  for the evaluation of subacute shoulder dislocations or recurrent 
shoulder instability. MRI has been shown to have similar performance to CT in the evaluation of Hill-Sachs 
lesions and glenoid bone loss [12,18]. MR arthrography has also been found to be reliable in diagnosi ng anterior 
shoulder instability and labroligamentous injuries [58,59]. MR arthrography has specifically o utperformed 
noncontrast MRI in assessment of glenohumeral ligament and anterior labral injuries [ 17,19], which ar e 
commonly seen in shoulder instability. MR arthrogr aphy has also outperformed noncontrast MRI in diagnosis of 
rotator cuff tears [17,19], which is a common associated finding in older patients with shoulder dislocation. 
However, high sensitivities reported for MR arthrography in the detection of labral pathology may not be 
applicable to patients with clinically unstable shoulders. A retrospective review of 90 patients with clinically 
unstable shoulders selected for arthroscopy [ 60] found that MR arthrography had a sensitivity of 65% for 
detection of labral  tears. The authors proposed that this discrepancy with prior studies was the result of different 
patient selection criteria (clinically unstable in their study versus less-specific symptoms such as shoulder pain in 
others) and the interpretation of MR art hrography by experienced musculoskeletal radiologists [ 60]. For this 
document, it is assumed the procedure is performed and interpreted by an expert.  
MRI Shoulder  
MRI without contrast may be pre ferred to MR arthrography in the setting of acute shoulder dislocation when a 
post-traumatic joint effusion is present to provide sufficient visualization of soft -tissue structures. In the subacute 
or chronic setting, the glenohumeral joint effusion is usually too small to provide adequate joint distention for 
optimal assessment  of soft -tissue structures.

Page Content: Most soft -tissue injuries (such as labral tears and rotator cuff tears) can undergo a period of 
conservative management prior to considering surgery. However, in addition to the specific imaging findings 
related to a traumatic injury, indications and timing of surgical treatment of many traumatic shoulder injuries are 
dependent on patient age, comorbidities, current activity level, and expected activity level.  
Imaging of chronic shoulder pain is beyond the scope of this topic  and is cove red in the  ACR Appropriateness 
Criteria® on “Shoulder Pain– Atraumatic ” [3]. 
Discussion o f Procedures  by Variant  
Variant 1:  Traumatic shoulder pain. Any etiology . Initial imaging . 
Radiography Shoulder  
Radiographs are the preferred initial study performed in the setting of traumatic shoulder pain . They can delineate 
shoulder malalignment and most shoulder fractures [ 4,5]. A standard set of shoulder radiographs for trauma 
should include at least three  views: anterior -posterior (AP) views in internal and external rotation and an axillary 
or scapula-Y view. Axillary or scapula-Y views are vital in evaluating traumatic shoulder injuries as 
acromioclavicular and glenohumeral dislocations can be misclassified on AP  views [6,7]. Radiographs provide 
good delineation of bony anatomy to assess for fracture and appropriate shoulder alignment, which are the two 
primary concerns in management of acute traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs should also be performed upright 
since malalignment of the shoul der can be under -represented on supine radiographs [ 4]. Additional views, such as 
the Bernageau view, have been sho wn to be effective in demonstrating the degree of bone loss of the glenoid or 
humeral head [ 8]. 
CT Shoulder  
Computed tomography ( CT) is better able than radiogr aphs to characteriz e fracture patterns [ 9-11].

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 8 Shoulder Pain –Traumatic  Variant 2: Traumatic shoulder pain. Nonlocalized shoulder pain. Negative radiographs . Next imaging 
study. 
Appropriately positioned  radiographs can exclude shoulder dislocation and most displaced fractures as the 
etiology for post -traumatic shoulder pain. In the setting of normal shoulder radiographs, the most common causes 
of post -traumatic shoulder pain are soft -tissue injuries such  as rotator cuff and labral tears.  
MRI Shoulder  
Noncontrast MRI is a reasonable imaging study in the setting of acute nonlocalized traumatic shoulder pain and 
noncontributory radiographs. In the acute trauma setting, noncontrast MRI may be preferred to MR arthrography , 
as acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint effusion for assessment of intra -articular 
soft-tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic 
pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [34,35]. MRI is also sensitive for diagnosing bone marrow 
contusion and has  been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries in pediatric patients [ 36,37]. 
MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography has been found to be superior to noncontrast MRI in the diagnosis of labroligamentous and 
partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [17,19]. In the acute trauma setting, however, noncontrast MRI may be 
preferred to MR arthrography because acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint 
effusion for assessment of intra-arti cular soft -tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing 
extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [ 34,35]. MRI is also sensitive

Shoulder dislocation or instability is most co mmon in the anterior direction. Younger patients are more likely to

patients are more likely to have rotator cuff tears in association with shoulder dislocation [ 55]. Coexisting 
humeral avulsion of the glenohumeral ligament and significant glenoid bone loss have been found in up to 10% of 
patients with recurrent shoulder instability [ 56], which underscores the need to assess both osseous and 
labroligamentous pathology in patients with shoulder dislocation or instability. Glenoid morphology and bone 
loss can play a significant factor in recurrent shoulder dislocations [15, 16,57], which may require bone grafting in 
order to restore stability [ 57].",True

Although MRI  of the sacroiliac joints  has high utility  for the diagnosis  of axSpA,  some  patients  will not demonstrate  
imaging  features of axSpA  in the sacroiliac joints  on MRI as indicated  by sensitivities  of all studies to varying 
degrees below  100%  [22], and therefore  some  patients may need  further imaging  evaluation  with MRI given that it 
is the imaging  modality  of choice for the diagnosis  of axSpA  [1,3,19,22] . Studies  have  shown  widely varying  
degrees of isolated  spinal  involvement  on MRI in axSpA  ranging from  1% to 49% [19,59-63,114,115] . Therefore,  
imag ing of the spine  is beneficial  for patients  in whom  there is suspicion  for axSpA  but imaging  of the sacroiliac 
joints  has been  negative.  Some  authors  have  shown  the utility  of using  whole -spine  or whole -body  MRI to identify  
the burden of disease rather  than selecting  specific areas of the spine  to image  because findings  may be potentially  
isolated  to any portion of the spine  [10,59,63,89,114,120-122] .

and prognosis  of their disease,  although radiographs  are more  typically  performed  to evaluate the spine  rather  than 
the sacroiliac  joints  [30]. This is because of  the low utility  of sacroiliac joint radiographs  for detecting  disease  
progression based  on the relatively  poor intra- and interreader  reliability  of interpretation  [141] . Radiographs  can 
demonstrate evolving  structural  changes or bone  formation,  although these changes occur  slowly  over time at the 
sacroiliac joints, often  requiring  years to detect  a change and prompting many  authors  to suggest  a radiographic  
imaging  interval  of axSpA  patients  of no less than 2 years for assessment  of disease progression [141- 146]. There 
is evidence that patients  on TNF -inhibitors  may have  slower  progression of structural  damage at the sacroiliac joints

2. According to the reference information given under CONTEXT, the patient's condition falls under ""acute hand and wrist trauma"". The patient has a penetrating trauma with a foreign body (power drill) in the soft tissues of the wrist. Initial imaging has not been performed yet.

3. The CONTEXT suggests that for initial imaging in acute hand and wrist trauma, Radiography of the area of interest is usually appropriate. For suspected penetrating trauma with a foreign body in the soft tissues in the hand or wrist, CT of the area of interest without IV contrast is usually appropriate due to its high sensitivity for detection of radiopaque foreign bodies. US of the area of interest is also usually appropriate, especially for detection of radiolucent foreign bodies and when the foreign body is located within the superficial soft tissues with no bone around it. MRI of the area of interest without IV contrast may be appropriate in certain circumstances, such as with complicated foreign bodies, but it has lower sensitivity compared to CT for detection of foreign bodies.

4. Based on the SCORING CRITERIA, the ordered scan (MRI right wrist without IV contrast) is MAY BE APPROPRIATE. However, considering the patient's condition and the CONTEXT, a Radiography of the area of interest or a CT of the area of interest without IV contrast would be USUALLY APPROPRIATE as the initial imaging study.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 5 Acute Hand and Wrist Trauma  Most fractures of the thumb are visible on a 2-view radiographic examination, although there is a slight increase 
in dia gnostic yield with the addition of an oblique projection [ 13], which can be obtained along with a PA 
examination of the whole hand.  
In patients with suspected finger tendon injuries, radiographs are used to detect fracture fragments, as large 
fragments may require open reduction and internal fixation.  Radiographs are usually sufficient for  the evaluation 
of osseous “mallet” injuries, which include bony avulsion at the insertion of the extensor mechanism of the finger 
to the distal interphalangeal joint [16]. In these injuries, involvement of more than one -third of the articular 
surface usually requires operative fixation.  Palmar displacement of the distal phalanx or an interfragmentary gap 
of >3 mm is also an indication for surgery [ 16]. With extensor tendon injuries, radiographs are commonly used to 
assess for bone involve ment and determine need for operative fixation [ 17]. 
CT Area of Interest  
In patients with intra -articular fractures seen on radiography , CT shows articular fracture fragment displacement, 
depression, and comminution more accurately than conventional radiographs [ 7,9,10]. CT measurements of 
articular surface gap and step -off are more reproducible than radiographs [7]. The addition of 3- D surface -
rendered reconstructions to the standard 2 -D CT images has been shown to change operative management in up to 
48% of intra -articular distal radius fractures [8]. 
There is no evidence to support the use of CT with intravenous  (IV) contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist 
trauma.

Page Content: Variant 2: Suspect acute hand or wrist trauma. Initial radiographs nega tive or equivocal. Next imaging 
study. 
Radiograph y Area of Interest  
In patients with clinical suspicion of hand or wrist fracture and negative radiographs, one option is to place the 
patient in a short arm cast and repeat the radiographs at 10  to 14 days [ 13]. The downside of this option is that it 
results in delay of diagnosis , which may lead to functional impairment . 
CT Area of Interest  
When the initial radiographs are equivocal, CT  without IV contrast  is commonly used to exclude or confirm 
suspected wrist fractures [18]. CT shows intra-articular extension of distal radius fractures more frequently than 
radiography.  Three-dimensional reconstructions can be particularly helpful in preoperative planning for complex 
articular injuries  [7,8]. 
CT should be used to exclude an occult fracture of the upper extremity. Unlike MRI, CT cannot evaluate for 
concomitant ligamentous injuries  [19-21 ]. 
CT is useful in diagnosing injuries that are difficult to recognize on radiographs, such as carpometacarpal joint 
fracture dislocations. For metacarpal and digital  fractures, CT is usually not indicated during acute injury [ 22]. 
There is no evidence to support the use of CT with IV contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist trauma.  
MRI Area o f Interest  
When initial radiographs are normal but there is high clinical suspicion for fracture, MRI without IV contrast can 
detect fractures of the distal radius and carpal bones [12,23-25] . One study of patients in which the radiographic 
findings did not explain the clinical symptoms reported that the MRI led to a change in diagnosis in 55% of 
patients and a change in patient management in 66%  [12]. However, another study of patients with acutely injured 
wrists reported that the MRI did not predict the need for treatment better than the combination of physical 
examination and radiography [ 23]. More importantly, there was no difference in outcomes  with MRI compared 
with radiography [24].

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 6 Acute Hand and Wrist Trauma  Like CT, MRI shows intra -articular extension of distal radius fractures more frequently than radiography.  Unlike 
CT, MRI shows concomitant ligament  injuries, including tears of the scapholunate ligament, which may affect 
surgical treatment [26,27]. Despite these advantages,  MRI performed immediately at the time of injury has little 
added value for determining which patients go on to surgery [ 23]. 
MRI is especially useful in evaluating  hand soft -tissues injuries, including the collateral ligaments, volar plates, 
tendons, and pulleys. For metacarpal and digital fractures, MRI is usually not indicated during acute injury [ 22]. 
There is no evidence to support the use of MRI with IV contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist trauma.  
US Area of Interest  
US may have a limited utility  for evaluating bone injuries. Christiansen et al  [28] reported 47% sensitivity and 
61% specificity of US  for the detection of scaphoid fractures . They concluded that US  is not suitable for the early 
diagnosis of scaphoid fracture.  In contrast, Hauger et al  [29] reported that using cortical disruption as a diagnostic 
criterion on US is an accurate sign for detecting occult fractures of the scaphoid waist. Further study of US  for the 
diagnosis of occult fractures is needed .

Variant 3: Acute wrist fracture on radiographs. Suspect wrist tendon or ligament trauma. Next imaging

Radiography Wrist  
Assessment of carpal instability with conventional radiographs requires careful attention to radiographic 
positioning.  In low -grade injuries, radiographs are usually normal.  Scapholunate diastasis of >4 mm and dorsal til t 
of the lunate of > 10° suggests dorsal intercalated segmental instability  [30,31].

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Hand injuries account for approximately 20% of emergency department visits [ 1]. According to the National 
Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey , 1.5% of all emergency department visits involve  hand and wrist 
fractu res. Distal radius fractures are especially common, accounting for up to 18% of fractures in the elderly [ 2,3]. 
Because of increasing rates of osteoporosis, the incidence of distal radius fractures has been increasing [ 4]. 
Although most distal radius fractures in e lderly patients are managed non operatively, the use of internal fixation is 
increasing. Internal fixation has a much higher cost than nonopera tive treatment as well as increased rates of 
hospitalization [5]. 
For most patients with trauma to the hand and wrist, conventional radiographs provide sufficient diagnostic 
information to guide the treating physician.  However, delayed diagnosis is common because distal radius and 
scaphoid fractures may be radiographically occult  [6]. When initial radiographs  are normal but there is high 
clinical suspicion for fracture, further imaging with additional radiographic pr ojections, CT, or MRI  is 
appropriate .

Successful treatment of distal radius fractures requires restoration of radial length, inclination, and tilt, as well as 
the realignment of the articular fracture fragments [9,11]. The presence of a coronally  oriented fracture line, die -
punch depression, or more than three articular fracture fragments are common indications for operative reduction 
[8]. Operative fixation resulting in < 2 mm of residual articular surface step-off is usually considered necessary to 
avoid long-term complications , such as osteoarthritis [9 ,12]. 
Discussion of Procedures by Variant  
Variant 1: Acute blunt or penetrating trauma to the hand or wrist. Initial imaging.  
Radiograph y Area of Interest  
Radiography is  always indicated as the initial imaging for suspected acute hand and wrist trauma.  For m ost joints 
of the extremities, especially those involving the wrist, hand, and fingers, a radiographic examination that 
includes only 2 views is not adequate for detecting fractures [13]. For patients with suspected  distal radius 
fractures, a 3-view examination  of the wrist  usually includes a posteroanterior (PA) , a lateral, and a 45° 
semi pronated oblique view  [11]. One study [ 14] reports that a fourth projection—a semisupinated oblique —
increases diagnostic yield for distal radius fractures.  
A standard 3 -view radiographic examination of the hand shows most fractures and dislocations of the metacarpals 
and phalanges [ 13]. For phalangeal injuries, some centers include a PA examination of the entire hand, whereas 
others limit the examination to the injured finger.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 5 Acute Hand and Wrist Trauma  Most fractures of the thumb are visible on a 2-view radiographic examination, although there is a slight increase 
in dia gnostic yield with the addition of an oblique projection [ 13], which can be obtained along with a PA 
examination of the whole hand.  
In patients with suspected finger tendon injuries, radiographs are used to detect fracture fragments, as large 
fragments may require open reduction and internal fixation.  Radiographs are usually sufficient for  the evaluation 
of osseous “mallet” injuries, which include bony avulsion at the insertion of the extensor mechanism of the finger 
to the distal interphalangeal joint [16]. In these injuries, involvement of more than one -third of the articular 
surface usually requires operative fixation.  Palmar displacement of the distal phalanx or an interfragmentary gap 
of >3 mm is also an indication for surgery [ 16]. With extensor tendon injuries, radiographs are commonly used to 
assess for bone involve ment and determine need for operative fixation [ 17]. 
CT Area of Interest  
In patients with intra -articular fractures seen on radiography , CT shows articular fracture fragment displacement, 
depression, and comminution more accurately than conventional radiographs [ 7,9,10]. CT measurements of 
articular surface gap and step -off are more reproducible than radiographs [7]. The addition of 3- D surface -
rendered reconstructions to the standard 2 -D CT images has been shown to change operative management in up to 
48% of intra -articular distal radius fractures [8]. 
There is no evidence to support the use of CT with intravenous  (IV) contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist 
trauma.

MRI is ideal for evaluating tendon injuries and helping with surgical planning [58, 59]. MRI is comm only used for 
the diagnosis of  Stener lesions of the thumb [60] and the diagnosis of pulley system injuries [61]. 
Hergan et al [62] reported a 100% sensitivity and specificity for assessment of thumb ulnar collateral ligament

collateral ligament tears in 16 cadaveric specimens.  
US Hand  
A Stener lesion occurs when the aponeurosis of the adductor pollicis muscle becomes interposed between the 
ruptured ulnar collateral ligament of the thumb and its site  of insertion at the base of the proximal phalanx. This 
lesion can be identified by absence of ulnar collateral ligament and the presence of a hypoechoic mass proximal to 
the apex of the metacarpal tubercle [64]. Dynamic examination shows the relationship of the aponeurosis to the 
retracted ligament stump [65] . 
US allows for diagnosis of pulley system injuries [ 66,67].

Page Content: A 2008 study showed 99% sensitivity of MRI, both for proximal femoral 
fractures and fractures of the pelvis [39] . With multiple studies indicating near 100% sensitivity for proximal 
femoral fracture, it has been suggested that a negative MRI may allow for confident discharge from the 
emergency department and reduce the number of cautionary admissions [23,29] . Conversely, rapid diagnosis of 
surgical fractures reduces delay to treatment  with associated improved  outcomes [10]. 
Several additional studies have also shown  high diagnostic a ccuracy for diagnosis of both pelvis fractures and 
soft-tissue injuries in addition to fractures of the proximal femur [28,30,39] . This versatility is important as many 
series have shown a high incidence of extrafemoral trauma in patients with acute hip pain and negative 
radiographs. For exampl e, in the study by Ohishi et al  [30], of 113 patients , 38% had fractures of the proximal 
femur and 33% had fractures of t he pelvis.  In another retrospective series, Dominguez et al  [21] found pelvic 
fractures to be more common than proximal femur fractures in this patient population,  emphasizing the 
importance of accuracy in the assessment of extrafem oral trauma . Although many of these pelvic fractures and 
soft-tissue injuries may not be treated surgically , correct diagnosis allows for appropriate conservative treatment , 
including protected weight -bearing, pain  control, deep vein thrombosis  prophylaxis, and skilled rehabilitation.  
In addition to its increased sensitivity for fracture detection, MRI has been shown to be useful in characterizing 
fracture morpholog y. Seemingly isolated fractures of the greater trochanter diagnosed on radiography frequent ly 
have intertrochanteric extension when evaluated with MRI [22]. In a classic stud y of 30 patients, Schultz et al  
[40] demonstrated the use of MRI to accurately depict the extent of the fracture line in these radiographically 
occult intertrochanteric fractures. There is an increasing trend to treat  incomplete intertrochanteric fractur es 
conservatively .

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 6 Acute Hip Pain -Suspected Fracture  Bone Scan H ips 
Prior to the advent of MRI, a bone scan was the preferred test for radiographically occult proximal femoral 
fractures. However, as early as 1993 , Rizzo et al [50] demonstrated MRI to be at least as accurate as bone scan s 
and with substantially decreased time to diagnosis. A later study by  Rubin et al [51] comparing bone scan s and 
MRI demonstrated i mproved sensitivity and specificity of MRI relative to bone scans . Moreover, t he bone scan 
group averaged an additional day to surgery.  
Bone scintigraphy is a time-consuming process. Bone scans may be falsely negative for up to 72 hours from the 
time of in jury, and false-positive scans are likewise common, related to osteoarthritis, soft -tissue injury , or any 
other process that may increase bone turnover [50] . It has been postulated that performing single -photon emission 
computed tomography may combine the sensitivity of bone scintig raphy with the spatial accuracy of CT , but there 
are no data to support this view. In current practice, the role of bone scan s as a secondary line of imaging in 
patients with contraindications to MRI has largely been usurped by CT.  
Summary of Recommendations 
• Variant 1:  Radiographs  of the hip, radiographs  of the pelvis, or radiographs  of the pelvis and hips is usually 
appropriate for the initial imaging of the hip with acute pain, fall or minor trauma, and suspected fracture.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Fractures of the proximal femur (commonly referred to as hip fractures)  are a frequent  source of morbidity and 
mortality in elderly osteoporotic patients [1]. Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type 
result in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men 
[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs 
will continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of 
life following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays 
in diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -
and long-term mortality [6-13]. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of hip fractures is critical. Hip fractures 
cannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded on the basis of physical exam ination  alone ; therefore , imaging plays a 
key role in early  and accurate diagnosis [14] .",True

head avascular necrosis is high. Fractures from high -force trauma are also commonly treated with surgical 
fixation for stability to reduce the risk of post -traumatic osteo arthritis. 
Discussion of Procedures by Variant  
Variant 1:  Acute hip pain. Fall or minor trauma. Suspect fracture. Initial imaging.  
Radiography Hip 
Radiography is the initial imaging modality of choice for assessment of acute hip pain with suspected fracture , 
with the more advanced imaging modalities reserved for instances of clinically suspected fracture in the setting of 
negative or equivocal radiographs. Radiographs are rapidly obtained and well tolerated by patients. When a 
fracture is demonstrated , freque ntly no more imaging is needed for treatment planning purposes [15 -17].

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 6 Acute Hip Pain -Suspected Fracture  Bone Scan H ips 
Prior to the advent of MRI, a bone scan was the preferred test for radiographically occult proximal femoral 
fractures. However, as early as 1993 , Rizzo et al [50] demonstrated MRI to be at least as accurate as bone scan s 
and with substantially decreased time to diagnosis. A later study by  Rubin et al [51] comparing bone scan s and 
MRI demonstrated i mproved sensitivity and specificity of MRI relative to bone scans . Moreover, t he bone scan 
group averaged an additional day to surgery.  
Bone scintigraphy is a time-consuming process. Bone scans may be falsely negative for up to 72 hours from the 
time of in jury, and false-positive scans are likewise common, related to osteoarthritis, soft -tissue injury , or any 
other process that may increase bone turnover [50] . It has been postulated that performing single -photon emission 
computed tomography may combine the sensitivity of bone scintig raphy with the spatial accuracy of CT , but there 
are no data to support this view. In current practice, the role of bone scan s as a secondary line of imaging in 
patients with contraindications to MRI has largely been usurped by CT.  
Summary of Recommendations 
• Variant 1:  Radiographs  of the hip, radiographs  of the pelvis, or radiographs  of the pelvis and hips is usually 
appropriate for the initial imaging of the hip with acute pain, fall or minor trauma, and suspected fracture.  
• Variant 2:  MRI pelv is and affected hip without IV contrast  or CT pelvis and hips without IV contrast is 
usually appropriate as the next imaging study for the evaluation of a cute hip pain from a fall or minor trauma  
with negative radiographs  and suspected fracture.

study by Pandey et  al [38] found no missed fractures in 10 of 33 patients with negative MRIs , all of whom were 
followed clinically for at least 6 mo nths.

Page Content: A new inability to bear weight is a 
clinically suspicious finding , although the sensitivity and specificity of this is unknown  [20]. Allowing for 
variation between studies, the estimated prev alence of occult fracture after negative radiographs has  been 
estimated  at 4% to 10% , indicating the inability of negative radiographs alone to exclude fracture [21,26] . Risk 
factors for radiographically occult fracture in these studies included those age >65, low -force trauma,  such as a 
ground-level fall , and female gender. These studies have almost exclusively included elderly patients.  There is no 
relevant literature regarding the sensitivity and specificity of radiographs in the younger patient population,  and 
clinicians are suggested to proceed with caution.  
Radiography Pelvis  
There is no specific literature  regarding the use of an AP view of the pelvis  alone  for acute hip pain following 
low-force trauma.  Previous literature regarding the accuracy of radiography has almost exclusively evaluated AP 
and cross-table lateral radiographs of the hip or the combined use of AP pelvis and hip radiographs. However, i t is 
well established that patients with clinically  suspected proximal femur fracture often have fractures of the pelvis,  
including the sacrum and pubic rami [21,27-30] . Therefore , it has been  recommended that the radiographic series 
include the AP view of the pelvis along with the orthogonal  views  of the symptomatic hip [31] . The inclusion of a 
pelvis radiograph also allows for comparison of potential abnormalities to the contralateral asymptomatic side.  
Pelvis radiographs share the same limitations in sensitivity  and specificity  for fracture detection as hip 
radiographs , and a negative radiograph alone cannot exclude fracture . 
Radiography Pelvis and Hip 
As previously discussed, p atients with clinically suspected proximal femur fracture often have fractures of the 
pelvis  that includ e the sacrum and pubic rami [21,27- 30]. Moreover, these pelvic fractures may occur in isolation 
or concomitant with a fracture of the proximal femur [28].

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Fractures of the proximal femur (commonly referred to as hip fractures)  are a frequent  source of morbidity and 
mortality in elderly osteoporotic patients [1]. Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type 
result in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men 
[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs 
will continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of 
life following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays 
in diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -
and long-term mortality [6-13]. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of hip fractures is critical. Hip fractures 
cannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded on the basis of physical exam ination  alone ; therefore , imaging plays a 
key role in early  and accurate diagnosis [14] .",True

Repeat radiograph s are not typically the next study but may be of use to identify early callous formation at an occult

Radiographs with better technique may assist in diagnosis of subtle injuries such as the lateral talar process avulsion , 
which  may erroneously be diagnosed as  a lateral ankle sprain  [37]. 
Radiography Ankle Stress Views  
Although ankle stress views are not the typical next best study for this patient group, if  there is clinical evidence of

at ligamentous attachments that may contribute t o widening of the joint spac e on radiographic stress views.

Lateral sprain is more common than medial strain , with the anterior talofibular ligament most commonly tor n. High 
sprain and fractures are more common in high -collision sport injuries [60], with higher incidence of ankle injuries

CT with IV contrast is not ind icated in this scenario because soft-tissue abnormalities and fluid collections can be 
identified on noncontr ast high -resolution CT studies. 
MRI Ankle  
MRI of the ankle without IV contrast is most sensitive for evaluation of occult fractures with associated bone 
marrow edema patterns, particularly in inversion injuries and persistent lateral ankle pain, as well  as presence and 
extent of soft -tissue injuries  [29]. Stress injuries of bone , including those of the weekend warrior , are best depicted 
by MRI  [50]. 
MRI is the reference standard for ligamentous injury and assessment of stability , which is particularly important in 
athletes, in whom determination of grade ( 1, 2, or 3) of syndesmotic ligament, anterior tibiofibular ligament , and 
deltoid injuries is critical for treatment planning and return to sport assessment [51]. High -resolution evaluation of 
the tendons and ligaments allows distinction between tendinopathy, sprain, and partial or complete tears.  
Ligament and tendon  injuries can occur without fracture on radiography . Gross terlinden et al [52] compared MR I 
and radiography and showed that 15% of ligamentous injuries ( including sprains , partial tears, and complete tears) 
at the syndesmosis in acute ankle injuries on MRI demonstrated no fracture on radiography. Presence o f bone bruise 
and adjacent soft -tissue edema have shown a higher association with acute ligamentous injuries ( anterior talofibular 
ligament most common) and tendon abnormalities [53,54]  in patients with negative radiographs.  MRI can also help 
exclude Salter 1 fractures in the pediatric population [55].

Special Imaging Considerations  
Avoidance of manipulation of the  ankle prior to radiographs in the absence of neurovascular deficit or critical skin 
injury is recommended in order to avoid remanipulation or complication in this setting [27].  Advances in MRI 
technology have facilitated short dedicated extremity MRI protocols in so me centers that may be used as an

Page Content: Radiography Ankle  
Repeat radiograph s are not typically the next study but may be of use to identify early callous formation at an occult 
fracture line or possible mineralization at a site of intramuscular hematoma if contusion occurred during trauma. 
Radiographs with better technique may assist in diagnosis of subtle injuries such as the lateral talar process avulsion , 
which  may erroneously be diagnosed as  a lateral ankle sprain  [37]. 
Radiography Ankle Stress Views  
Although ankle stress views are not the typical next best study for this patient group, if  there is clinical evidence of 
instability on physician maneuvers, ankle stress views may be of benefit for identification of occult avulsion injury 
at ligamentous attachments that may contribute t o widening of the joint spac e on radiographic stress views.  
US Ankle  
US is not typically  the next imaging study . US may be useful as a secondary evaluation modality for focuse d 
evaluation of underlying soft -tissue injuries  and ligaments, with the added benefit of dynamic imaging. This 
includes f ocused high-resolution US of the peroneal tendons and th e superior peroneal retinaculum  [56], stress US 
(during anterior drawer) to assess joint laxity or chondral avulsion fra ctures associated with lateral ligament injury 
in children with negative radiographs [57,58] , and potential detection of superficial occult fractures at the base of 
the fifth metatarsal, lateral malleolus,  and malleolus [41] . 
Variant  5: Adult or child 5 years of age or older. Acute trauma to the ankle. No exclusionary criteria present. 
Radiographs demonstrate fracture or potential osteochondral injury. Next study.  
Bone Scan Ankle  
Osteochondral lesions  
Bone scan is not the next imaging study in this clinical scenario.  
Fractures  
Bone scan is not the next imaging study in this clinical scenario. Bone scan may be used in rare setting in polytrauma 
cases for evaluation of multiple fractures.

subtalar motion after a period of immobilizat ion [49]. 
CT with IV contrast is not ind icated in this scenario because soft-tissue abnormalities and fluid collections can be 
identified on noncontr ast high -resolution CT studies. 
MRI Ankle  
MRI of the ankle without IV contrast is most sensitive for evaluation of occult fractures with associated bone 
marrow edema patterns, particularly in inversion injuries and persistent lateral ankle pain, as well  as presence and 
extent of soft -tissue injuries  [29]. Stress injuries of bone , including those of the weekend warrior , are best depicted 
by MRI  [50]. 
MRI is the reference standard for ligamentous injury and assessment of stability , which is particularly important in 
athletes, in whom determination of grade ( 1, 2, or 3) of syndesmotic ligament, anterior tibiofibular ligament , and 
deltoid injuries is critical for treatment planning and return to sport assessment [51]. High -resolution evaluation of 
the tendons and ligaments allows distinction between tendinopathy, sprain, and partial or complete tears.  
Ligament and tendon  injuries can occur without fracture on radiography . Gross terlinden et al [52] compared MR I 
and radiography and showed that 15% of ligamentous injuries ( including sprains , partial tears, and complete tears) 
at the syndesmosis in acute ankle injuries on MRI demonstrated no fracture on radiography. Presence o f bone bruise 
and adjacent soft -tissue edema have shown a higher association with acute ligamentous injuries ( anterior talofibular 
ligament most common) and tendon abnormalities [53,54]  in patients with negative radiographs.  MRI can also help 
exclude Salter 1 fractures in the pediatric population [55].

The Broden view is a supine  flexed knee view with 30 ° to 45° internal rotation that  can be used  for specific improved 
evaluation of the lateral process fracture of the talus (commonly known as snowboarder’s fracture). It may be of 
use when further evaluation of the talar fracture is needed.

US is not the next step in this clinical scenario.  
Fractures  
US has been shown to be useful for identification of lateral malleolar, medial malleolar , and fifth metatarsal 
fractures [41] but is not conside red a first -line assessment tool  or next imaging study  in this clinical scenario.  
Variant 6 : Adult or child 5 years of age or older. Acute trauma to the ankle. Radiographs negative for osseous 
injury and physical examination or radiographs demonstrate alignment abnormality  suggesting 
syndesmotic/ligamentous injury or dislocation. Next study. 
Lateral sprain is more common than medial strain , with the anterior talofibular ligament most commonly tor n. High 
sprain and fractures are more common in high -collision sport injuries [60], with higher incidence of ankle injuries 
during winter months [67] and increased incidence in military recruits [68]. Inversion injuries of the ankle account 
for 25% of musculoskeletal system injuries and 50% of all sports -related injuries [1].  
Bone Scan Ankle  
Bone scan is not routinely the next line of imaging in this clinical scenario.  
CT Ankle  
CT is useful for evaluation of dislocation and can be used to detect  syndesmotic injuries, although MRI is better for 
soft-tissue evaluation. Nault et al [69]  validated CT scan measurement s that  can identify syndesmotic injuries seen 
on MRI (retrosp ective study of MRI and CT) as a result of  modification of distal tibiofibular relationship after a 
mild syndesmotic injury.

athletes, in whom determination of grade (1, 2,  or 3) of syndesmotic ligament, anterior tibiofibular ligament , and 
deltoid injuries is critica l for treatment planning and return to sport assessment [51] .

Rare pantalar dislocations without associated talar or other fracture can be assessed on CT or MRI and have high 
rates of osteonecrosis, osteoarthritis, and infection  [71]. 
Radiography Ankle Stress Views  
Stress radiograph s may be useful in assessing syndesmotic instability, particularly in supination external rotation 
ankle injuries according to the Lauge -Hansen classification. Lee et al [72]  noted that tibiotalar tilt angle and anterior 
tibiofibular space measurements were affected when the anterior tibiofibular and posterior talofibular ligaments 
were injured (confirmed on MRI) in 299 patients . Lateral stress testing with widening of the tibiofibular clear space 
has been shown to be  an indicator of syndesmotic injury , with the traditional external rotation stress test shown to 
be a poor indicator when t he deltoid ligament is injured [73] . 
Radiography Leg 
Maisonneuve fracture (syndesmotic injury of the ankle in combination with a proximal fibular fracture) may be 
overlooked as a result of  lack of pain at the fibula.

Summary of Recommendations  
Variant 1: Ankle radiographs are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of patients 5 years of age or older with 
acute trauma to the ankle or acute trauma to the ankle with persistent pain for more than 1 week but less than 3 
weeks with no exclusionar y criteria present and the OAR  are positive : 1. Inability to bear weight immediately after 
the injury, OR  2. Point tenderness over the medial malleolus, the posterior edge or inferior tip of the lateral 
malleolus, talus, or calcaneus, OR  3. Inability to ambulate for 4 steps in the emergency department.  
Variant 2: Imaging is usually not appropriate for patients 5 years of age or older with a cute trauma to the ankle 
when the patient is able  to walk  and there are no exclusionary criteria present (eg, neurologically intact (includ ing 
no peripheral neuropathy )) and  the OAR  are negative: No point tenderness over the malleoli, talus, or calcaneus on 
physical examination.  
Variant 3: Ankle radiographs are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of patients 5 ye ars of age or older  with 
acute trauma to the ankle when exclusionary criteria are present (eg, neurologic disorder, neuropathy, or other) and 
the patient does not meet requirements for evaluation by the OAR . 
Variant 4: MRI ankle without IV contrast or CT a nkle without IV contrast  are usually appropriate  for patients 5 
years of age or older with acute trauma to the ankle with persistent pain for more than 1 week but less than 3 weeks

If there are clinical  signs  of a Lisfranc  injury , obtaining  weight bearing  radiographs  is recommended  when  
possible  because nonweightbearing  radiographs  are not reliable  for detection  of subtle  injuries.  Weightbearing  
views have  been  shown  to increase the abnormal  alignment  at the Lisfranc joint, thus making it easier  to identify  a 
Lisfranc injury  [16,19] . The inclusion  of both feet on AP radiographs  can help in the detection  of subtle  
malalignment  when  compared  with the uninjured side [20]. 
CT Foot  
CT is commonly used in evaluating  the true extent  of osseous injury  in complex fractures and at times  is used as 
the initial imaging  study  in polytrauma  patients  and in complex  regions  such as the midfoot  [21,22] . CT is not

Lisfranc  Injury  
MRI has been  advocated  as a sensitive diagnostic  test in evaluation  of Lisfranc ligamentous  complex  (especially  
if the patient  is not able to bear weight),  and 3-D volumetric  acquisitions  have  proven superiority  over orthogonal  
proton  density  fat-suppressed  imaging [33,38,41- 45]. There is a high correlation  between  MRI and intraoperative

MRI is an accurate method used in the evaluation  of soft-tissue,  osseous,  and neural  injuries  after knee  dislocation  
[61]. MRA  may be performed  simultaneously  with MRI  for evaluation  of internal  derangement  and vascular  injuries  
with less morbidity  compared  with conventional  angiography  [62]. Potter  et al [61] reported  their experience with 
popliteal fossa MRA  with encouraging  results and complete agreement  between  the MRA  and conventional  
angiography in patients  who had both studies.  Similarly, in a study  by Tocci  et al [62], MRA  has been  shown  to be 
as accurate and useful  as conventional  angiography in the evaluation  of popliteal  artery  injuries  of patients  with 
knee  dislocations.  
MRI Knee  
With  its superb  contrast  resolution  and multiplanar  imaging capability , MRI is proven to be a highly  accurate  
imaging modality  in the evaluation  of bone  marrow  contusions  and occult  fractures [27-29] as well as meniscal  
[21,26]  and ligamentous  injuries  [21,31,32] . It can be performed  in conjunction  with MRA  for evaluation  of internal  
derangement  and vascular  injuries  with less morbidity  compared  with conventional  angiography [62].

In the setting  of significant  acute trauma  to the knee , radiographs  should  be the first imaging study.

Arteriography  Lower Extremity  
Vascular  injury  may be found in about  30% of patients  following  posterior  knee  dislocation  [56]. Injuries  of the 
popliteal artery  require  prompt  surgical  intervention to help limb preservation . Associated  peroneal  and tibial nerve  
injuries  may cause significant  morbidity and require  an understanding of their pathophysiologic  implications  to 
maximize  limb functionality  [57]. Angiography  has been  the reference standard  in the evaluation  of vascular  injuries  
associated  with knee  dislocations  [58]. However,  this is an invasive  procedure  with associated  risk, and with the 
excellent  performance of CTA and MRA, it is usually  performed  in selected  cases  [58]. 
CT Knee  
CT is not routinely  used as the initial imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the knee.  CT is superior  
to knee  radiographs  in detection  and classification  of fractures [12]; however,  without  IV contrast , CT cannot  detect  
vascular  injuries. 
CTA Lower Extremity  
With  suspected  vascular  injuries  in the setting  of knee  dislocation, CTA  is frequently  used because it is less invasive  
and has a similar ly high accuracy  as conventional  angiography [58-60]. 
MR Arthrography  Knee  
In patients  with significant  acute knee  trauma  with suspected  or possible  dislocation , MR arthrography  of the knee 
is not routinely used as the initial imaging  study.

Page Content: Patellofemoral car tilage loss is also associated with chronic knee pain , with active knee pain correlated with 
BMLs [30,31]. Similar to CT, MRI can calculate various anatomic measurements associated with patellofemoral 
subluxation/dislocation and lateral patellofemoral friction syndrome [32-34]. Bone marrow edema in the classic 
location for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also 
differentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise 
therapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. 
Other etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat 
pad impingement syndromes, Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome, adhesive 
capsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes , 
and osteonecrosis [15, 19,36-45].  
MRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a 
joint effusion. However, contrast -enhanced images ma y be more accurate in diagnosing other causes of chronic 
knee pain , such as Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome, and adhesive 
capsulitis [15].  In particular, enh ancing synovitis thicker than 2 mm in Hoffa’s fat is correlated with peripatellar 
pain [46]. Contrast -enhanced MRI is also useful in quantifying the degree of synovitis and in evaluating 
conditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis [ 17,42,47,48].

Summary of Literature Review  
Background/Introduction 
Chronic knee pain affects tens of millions of people  in the United States annually , with the pain sometimes highly 
disabling and often negatively impacting the patient’s quality of life. Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and 
it can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain 
with the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. 
Typically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain 
persists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  
imaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated 
that approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the 
prior year) radiographs [2 ]. 
This document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  ≥5 years of age.

painful or asymptomatic knee not significantly different in patients 45 to 55 years of age [20,21]. 
Bone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the 
subchondral bone.  New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or 
patients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee 
pain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the 
origin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. 
Subchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed 
spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to 
elderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs 
often initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, 
and progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is 
suspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria
® 
topic on “ Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae ” [28]. 
Some patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using 
quantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs 
exhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ].

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 6 Acute  Trauma  to the Knee  Discussion  of Procedures  by Variant  
Variant  1: Adult  or child 5 years of age or older . Fall or acute  twisting  trauma  to the knee.  No focal  
tenderness,  no effusion, able to walk.  Initial imaging.  
CT Knee  
In the absence of focal  tenderness and joint effusion  in a patient  who is able to walk,  CT is not used as the initial  
imaging study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the knee.  
MR Arthrography  Knee  
MR arthrography  is not routinely  used as the initial imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the knee.  
MRA Knee  
MR angiography  (MRA ) is not routinely used as the initial imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the 
knee.  
MRI Knee  
MRI is not routinely  used as the initial imaging study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the knee.  
Radiography Knee  
With no clinical  symptoms  in the injured  knee , including lack of focal  tenderness and joint effusion , and with ability  
to walk,  knee  radiographs  may be indicated  if a patient  >55 years old per Ottawa rules or >50 years old or <12 years 
old per Pittsburgh  rule criteria [5, 6, 10]. If the patient  is between  5 and 12 years,  they fall outside  the age range  for 
both the Ottawa and Pittsburgh  rules and radiographs  may be beneficial  despite lack of clinical  symptoms.  
Radiographs  are commonly  performed  in the setting  of acute knee  injuries  but have  a low yield  for showing  
fractures.  In a retrospective review of 1,967 patients  with acute knee  injuries  by Stiell et al [2], 74.1%  of patients  
had knee  radiography,  and only 5.2%  of these had fractures.

MRI findings  shortened  the diagnostic  completion  workup,  reduced  the number  of additional  diagnostic  procedures,  
and improve d quality  of life in the first 6 weeks,  potentially  reduc ing productivity loss. 
A retrospective study  by Cecava et al [25] showed  that knee  radiography  is a highly specific screening  test for 
internal  derangement  in patients  <40 years old with acute knee injury.  In this patient population,  knee  effusion  >10 
mm on lateral  radiograph  should prompt  consideration  for the knee  MRI examination , which  can potentially  
decrease delayed  diagnosis,  improve  patient  outcomes,  and decrease  disability  [25].  
Magee et al [26] reported  96% sensitivity  and 97% specificity  of 3T MRI in the detection  of meniscal  tears in 
correlation  with arthroscopy . However,  a study  by Van Dyck  et al [21] showed  similar  high sensitivities  and 
speci ficities  of routine  3T and 1.5T MRI examinations  in the evaluation  of meniscal  and ACL  tears with 
arthroscopic  correlation.  Routine  3T MRI  protocol  did not significantly  improve  accuracy  for evaluating  the knee  
menisci  and ACL  compared  with a similar  1.5T MRI  protocol.  
MRI can diagnose  the pattern s and severity  of bone  marrow  contusions  that frequently  have  an association  with the 
specific mechanisms of injury  and can predict  associated  soft-tissue injuries  [27,28] . In a study by Song  et al [28],

CT Knee  
In patients  with radiographic  diagnosis  of the tibial plateau  fracture,  CT is frequently  performed  for further  
classification  and characterization  of the fracture  severity  [12,52]  and may predict  or diagnose  ligamentous  injuries  
[13-15,50,51]  and predict  meniscal  injuries  [15,50] . A study by Spiro  et al [50] found  that the amount  of articular

indicated  to confirm  or exclude  meniscal  and ligamentous  injuries  [50]. In a study  by Mustonen et al [12], CT 
showed  100%  sensitivity  and radiographs  83% sensitivity  in detection  of tibial plateau  fractures , and CT was

In the absence of findings on routine radiography, imaging options to evaluate ligamentous integrity include stress radiography, MRI, MR arthrography, CT arthrography, and US.  
MRI  
One study eva luating anterior talofibular ligament injury demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy of 97% for MRI 
when compared to arthroscopic findings. Additionally, MRI identified the exact location of the injury in 93% of 
the cases [15].  Comparing MRI with arthroscopy, studies have shown a range of accuracies of chronic lateral 
ligament tearing (either partial or complete), ranging from 77 % to 92% for the anterior talofibular ligament and 
88% to 92% for the calcaneofibular ligament [14, 52]. For the evaluation of deep deltoid ligament tears, MRI is 
both sensitive and specific compared with arthroscopy, with reported values of 96% and 98%, respectively [53].  
With regard to tears of the tibiofibular ligaments of the tibiofibular syndesmosis, MRI has a reported accuracy of 100% [54]. Additionally, MRI can also demonstrate interosseous membrane tears [55]. MRI offers the advantage 
of evaluating for injuries associated with or mimicking lateral instability that may not be diagnosed on stress radiography such as tenosynovitis, tendon injury, and osteochondral lesions [56]. MRI may also be used to evaluate the ankle after lateral ligament reconstruction [57].  
MR Arthrography  
MR arthrography can be helpful for the assessment of chronic ankle instability due to lateral collateral ligament injuries [12].

Discussion of Procedures  by Variant  
Variant 1: Chronic ankle pain. Initial imaging . 
Radiography 
Radiography should be considered as the initial imaging study . Radiographs may reveal osteoarthritis, calcified or 
ossif ied intra -articular bodies, osteochondral abnormalities, stress fractures,  or evidence of prior trauma. Ankle 
effusions may also be identified in the anterior ankle joint recess by radiography with 53% to 74% accuracy  [19]. 
They are often associated with ligamentous injury or fracture [19]. The presence of ossific fragments can indicate 
ligamentous injury or retinaculum avulsion [20], whereas periostitis can occur adjacent to tenosynovitis. 
Radiographs can also identify synovial osteochondromatosis and erosions from chronic synovitis.  
CT 
CT is not routinely used as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain.  
MRI  
MRI is not routinely used as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Ankle pain is considered chronic when symptoms persist > 6 weeks. Chronic ankle  pain can be caused by a variety 
of osseous or soft -tissue abnormalities, either alone or in combination. For assessing chronic ankle pain, there are 
multiple imaging options, including radiography, stress radiography,  computed tomography (CT)  radionuclide 
bone scanning, ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and various injection procedures. Injection 
proce dures include arthrography, CT arthrography, MR arthrography, and diagnostic injection with anesthetic 
agents. Although there are numerous causes for chronic ankle pain, common etiologies include osteoarthritis, 
osteochondral injury, tendon abnormalities, ligament abnormalities and instability, and impingement.  
Overview of Imaging Modalities  
Radiography Radiographs can provide information about the osseous and soft -tissue structures about the ankle. Routine 
radiographs of the ankle typically include anteroposterior, lateral, and mortise views, the latter obtained by internally rotating the foot 15 to 20 degrees.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Ankle pain is considered chronic when symptoms persist > 6 weeks. Chronic ankle  pain can be caused by a variety 
of osseous or soft -tissue abnormalities, either alone or in combination. For assessing chronic ankle pain, there are 
multiple imaging options, including radiography, stress radiography,  computed tomography (CT)  radionuclide 
bone scanning, ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and various injection procedures. Injection 
proce dures include arthrography, CT arthrography, MR arthrography, and diagnostic injection with anesthetic 
agents. Although there are numerous causes for chronic ankle pain, common etiologies include osteoarthritis, 
osteochondral injury, tendon abnormalities, ligament abnormalities and instability, and impingement.  
Overview of Imaging Modalities  
Radiography Radiographs can provide information about the osseous and soft -tissue structures about the ankle. Routine 
radiographs of the ankle typically include anteroposterior, lateral, and mortise views, the latter obtained by internally rotating the foot 15 to 20 degrees.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 9 Chronic Ankle Pain  Radiography 
Stress views are not routinely used for the evaluation of suspected tendon abnormality.  
Variant 5: Chronic ankle pain. Ankle radiographs normal or nonspecific, suspected ankle instability. Next study . 
In the absence of findings on routine radiography, imaging options to evaluate ligamentous integrity include stress radiography, MRI, MR arthrography, CT arthrography, and US.  
MRI  
One study eva luating anterior talofibular ligament injury demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy of 97% for MRI 
when compared to arthroscopic findings. Additionally, MRI identified the exact location of the injury in 93% of 
the cases [15].  Comparing MRI with arthroscopy, studies have shown a range of accuracies of chronic lateral 
ligament tearing (either partial or complete), ranging from 77 % to 92% for the anterior talofibular ligament and 
88% to 92% for the calcaneofibular ligament [14, 52]. For the evaluation of deep deltoid ligament tears, MRI is 
both sensitive and specific compared with arthroscopy, with reported values of 96% and 98%, respectively [53].  
With regard to tears of the tibiofibular ligaments of the tibiofibular syndesmosis, MRI has a reported accuracy of 100% [54]. Additionally, MRI can also demonstrate interosseous membrane tears [55]. MRI offers the advantage 
of evaluating for injuries associated with or mimicking lateral instability that may not be diagnosed on stress radiography such as tenosynovitis, tendon injury, and osteochondral lesions [56]. MRI may also be used to evaluate the ankle after lateral ligament reconstruction [57].  
MR Arthrography  
MR arthrography can be helpful for the assessment of chronic ankle instability due to lateral collateral ligament injuries [12].  
US 
One study evaluating anterior talofibular ligamen t injury demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy of 91% for US when 
compared to arthroscopic findings.

which  can contribute to patient symptoms  [18].  
Discussion of Procedures  by Variant  
Variant 1: Chronic ankle pain. Initial imaging . 
Radiography 
Radiography should be considered as the initial imaging study . Radiographs may reveal osteoarthritis, calcified or 
ossif ied intra -articular bodies, osteochondral abnormalities, stress fractures,  or evidence of prior trauma. Ankle 
effusions may also be identified in the anterior ankle joint recess by radiography with 53% to 74% accuracy  [19]. 
They are often associated with ligamentous injury or fracture [19]. The presence of ossific fragments can indicate 
ligamentous injury or retinaculum avulsion [20], whereas periostitis can occur adjacent to tenosynovitis. 
Radiographs can also identify synovial osteochondromatosis and erosions from chronic synovitis.  
CT 
CT is not routinely used as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain.  
MRI  
MRI is not routinely used as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain.  
US 
US is not routinely used  as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain.

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  elbow  pain is a common  patient  complaint  in the primary  care setting. Patients  may report  symptoms  of 
swelling,  pain,  restricted  range  of motion,  stiffness,  and numbness  or tingling  [1]. There is a wide  differential  
diagnosis  for chronic  elbow  pain, including osseous,  soft tissue,  cartil aginous , and nerve -related  abnormalities.  
Epicondylalgia , caused  by tendinosis  of the common  extensor  tendon laterally  (“tennis elbow”)  or medially  the 
common  flexor  tendon  (“golfer’s  elbow ”), is the most  common  cause of chronic  elbow  pain,  estimated  to occur in 
1% to 3% of the population  [2]. Epicondylalgia  is associated  with lost workdays  and a significant  economic  burden

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  elbow  pain is a common  patient  complaint  in the primary  care setting. Patients  may report  symptoms  of 
swelling,  pain,  restricted  range  of motion,  stiffness,  and numbness  or tingling  [1]. There is a wide  differential  
diagnosis  for chronic  elbow  pain, including osseous,  soft tissue,  cartil aginous , and nerve -related  abnormalities.  
Epicondylalgia , caused  by tendinosis  of the common  extensor  tendon laterally  (“tennis elbow”)  or medially  the 
common  flexor  tendon  (“golfer’s  elbow ”), is the most  common  cause of chronic  elbow  pain,  estimated  to occur in 
1% to 3% of the population  [2]. Epicondylalgia  is associated  with lost workdays  and a significant  economic  burden  
[3].

MRI has high inter- and intraobserver  reliability  for the diagnosi s of epicondylalgia  [26]. It also has a sensitivity  of 
90% to 100%  and a specificity  of 83% to 100%  [27]. The most  specific findings  of medial  epicondylalgia  include  
interm ediate to high T2 signal  or high T2 signal  within  the common  flexor  tendon  and paratendinous  soft tissue  
edema [28]. MRI has the benefit  of demonstrating associated  findings  in epicondylalgia , including radial  collateral  
and lateral  UCL  injuries  [26]. MRI may also facilitate  surgical  planning [29]. 
MRI is useful  for the diagnosis  of biceps  tendon injury.  Sensitivity  and specificity  are reported  at 92.4%  and 100%,  
respectively,  in detecting  distal  biceps tendon  ruptures  and 59.1%  and 100%,  respectively  for partial  tears [30]. 
US Elbow  
US elbow  has moderate agreement  with MR elbow  for the diagnosis  and grading of common  extensor  tendon tears.  
US sensitivity, specificity,  and accuracy  are reported  at 64.25%,  85.19%,  and 72.73% , respectively  [31]. Recently,  
sonoelastography  has shown more  promising outcomes for detection  of medial  epicondylalgia  with a sensitivity,  
specificity,  accuracy,  positive  predictive  value , and negative  predictive  value  of 95.2%,  92%,  93.5%,  90.9%,  and 
95.8%,  respectively  [32]. Another  new technique,  superb  microvascular  imaging,  can be used to detect  subtle  low

While CT with IV contrast enhancement can depict abscesses, it is usually not appropriate  for evaluation of 
suspected wrist infections.  
CT Arthrography  Wrist  
CT arthrography is not routinely used to eval uate suspected wrist infection.  
US Wrist  
There may be a role for US in the staging of infections (for example, to delineate the location and e xtent of soft -
tissue abscesses) after aspiration has been performed.  Alternatively, US may be used in conjunction with 
aspiration as a method to first identify collections and then as the imaging method to guide aspiration.  
Bone Scan  Wrist  
Bone scan is not  routinely used to eval uate suspected chronic wrist infection.  
Arthrography  Wrist  
Radiographic arthrography  is not routinely used to eval uate suspected wrist infection.  
Variant 5:  Ulnar -sided chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or nonspecific . Next study.  
MRI Wrist  
Both traumatic and degenerative lesions of the TFCC can produce chronic, ulnar -sided wrist pain . MRI is highly 
accurate for lesions involving the radial (central) zone of the disc, especially with the use of high -resolution fast 
spin-echo or 3-D grad ient-recalled pulse sequences [36]. There is some evidence suggesting that MRI performed 
with a 3.0 T system is even more accurate than MRI performed with a 1.5 T system for TFCC lesions [37], but 
there are no studies comparing the accuracy of the two field s trengths in the same patients. The sensitivity for 
tears of the ulnar attachment of the disc and the peripheral attachments (the ulnocarpal ligaments) are only fair 
with noncontrast -enhanced wrist MRI [ 12,36]. IV contrast seldom provides added benefit in patients with ulnar -
sided wrist pain but may increase sensitivity for TFCC lesions if MR arthrography is desired but direct joint 
injection is not feasible.

Page Content: These factors make CT the 
preferred examination for suspected distal radioulnar joint subluxation, where images of both wrists can be  
obtained in both supination and pronation [1 ,13]. A disadvantage of CT  is its lower sensitivity to soft -tissue 
abnormalities  compared with MRI.  
High-resolution (typically multidetector) CT of the wrist following contrast injection into one or more wrist 
compartments (CT arthrography) is a powerful tool for diagnosing intra -articular abnormalities [14,15]. The 
intraobserver agreement on CT arthrogram images is extremely high and better than that reported for MRI 
[14,16]. 
US 
US of the wrist is useful for examining extra -articular soft tissues, such as suspected ganglion cyst s [17], because 
its accuracy is similar to that of MRI. US can also be used to diagnose abnormalities of the flexor and extensor 
tendons and tendon sheaths. For de Quervain disease (stenosing tenosynovitis of the abductor pollicis lon gus and 
extensor pollicis brevis tendon compartment), preoperative identification of a septum or subcompartmentalization 
within the first dorsal compartment with US  may affect surgical management [18 ,19]. 
In patients with suspected or established rheumatoid arthritis (RA), US examination of the wrist and selected 
finger joints can identify erosions and active synovit is (with the use of power Doppler), findings that influence 
early diagnosis and treatment decisions [20]. Using US to measure the size of the median nerve is a  validated  
technique in patients with clinical symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome [21-24].  
In addition, w rist US is a useful technique to guide therapeutic intr a-articular and other soft -tissue injections [25].

Page Content: In rare cases of secondary carpal tunnel syndrome, MRI may identify 
a mass lesion compressing the median nerve. There is some evidence that the length of T2 hyperintensity in the 
median nerve can help prognosticate the success of surgery [69] and that the shape and signal of the nerve predict 
clinical response to a steroid injection in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome [70 ]. MR neurography 
may be an option in patients with suspected carpal tunnel syndrome.  The use o f IV contrast does not contribute to 
diagnosis and is usually not appropriate.

Summary of Recommendations  
• Wrist radiographs are indicated as the best initial imaging examination in patients with chronic wrist pain. 
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal and a patient has persistent symptoms wi th an unclear diagnosis, 
MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate.  
• In patients with suspected inflammatory arthritis, MRI either with or without IV contrast is usually 
appropriate if guidance for management or prognostication is needed.  
• Patients with  suspected wrist infection should undergo aspiration.  
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal in a patient with ulnar -sided pain, either MRI without IV contrast 
or an MR arthrogram of the wrist is usually appropriate.  
• When radiographs are normal or equivocal in a patient with radial -sided pain, MRI without IV contrast is 
usually appropriate.

complications of the fracture.  
Variant 12: Chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or nonspecific. Suspect carpal tunnel syndrome.  Next 
study. 
US Wrist 
Several meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the 
carpal  tunnel  inlet) is highly accurate for identifying carpal  tunnel syndrome  diagnosed clinically or with the 
combination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US 
varies depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the 
measurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary 
examination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel 
syndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal 
tunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, 
clinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of 
carpal tunnel syndrome. US may be appropriate in cases where this initial evaluation is equivocal.  
MRI Wrist  
Historically, carpal tunnel syndrome has been diagnosed based on clinical signs and sympt oms and confirmed by 
the results of electrodiagnostic studies [67]. MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in cases in which this  
initial evaluation is equivocal. The MRI findings that have been reported in wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome —
including nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing—may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value 
in patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68].",False

Radiography Foot  
Conventional radiography can be useful to distinguish among different causes of chronic foot pain and is usually 
the first imag ing study in evaluating patients with chronic foot pain.  
The value of radiographs in the diagnosis of tarsal coalitions has been extensively demonstrated. Overall 
sensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs 
in the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral 
and oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar 
coalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs 
on the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have 
been found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable 
methods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  
Radiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review 
by Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for 
radiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.  
Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain.

Clinical concern includes sesamoiditis, Morton’s  neuroma, intermetatarsal bursitis, chronic plantar plate 
injury, or Freiberg’s infraction. Next imaging study.  
Bone Scan Foot  
Planar b one scintigraphy has low anatomic resolution and has been shown to be a nonspecific technique to assess 
the hallucal sesamoids [24]. However, bone scintigraphy with single -photon emission computed tomography 
(SPECT)/CT increases contrast resolution and anatomic localization of foci with increased osteoblastic activity  
[25]. Bone scintigraphy may demonstrate increased uptake in pathologic conditions affecting the fir st metatarsal 
sesamoids not evident on radiographs. A less dramatic uptake is noted in stress fractures, which may be helpful to 
differentiate between them and acute fractures [26]. When an indeter minate linear lucency is visualized on 
radiographs, a negative bone scintigraphy suggest s sesamoid bipartition [12] . Other conditions that may present 
positive findings on Tc -99m -methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scint igraphy include sesamoiditis, 
inflammatory or deposition arthropathies, osteoarthritis , and osteonecrosis [39]. In Freiberg’s infraction, a 
photopenic center with a hyperactive collar may be identified on early stages on high -resolution Tc -99m -MDP bone 
scintigraphy [27]. 
CT Foot  
CT may be useful to confirm suspected sesamoid stress fractures on radiographs and to distinguish between a stress 
fracture and a bipartite sesamoid with more precision than conventional radiography [28] .

Page Content: Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  
usually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, 
osteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite 
versus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess 
with radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton’s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other 
causes of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg’s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals 
or soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . 
Though radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in 
patients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The 
combination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a 
specificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15]. 
US Foot  
Ultrasound (US) is usually not indicate d as the first imaging  study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain, but may 
be performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of pathologic conditions of the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, 
and other conditions such as tarsal tunnel syndrome, Morton’s  neuroma , plantar plate tears,  and intermetatarsal 
bursitis.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic foot pain is a frequent clinical complaint with approximately 14% to 42% of adults in the United States 
reporting foot problems, often with significant impact on mobility, difficulty performing daily activities , and 
increased risk of falling, particularly in older individuals [1,2] . Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a 
significant improvement in health-related quality of life with effective treatment of foot pain [3] . Estimating the 
prevalence of chron ic foot pain is challenging, because there is no consensus regarding the definition of chronic 
pain in the literature. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines chronic pain as any pain persisting 
past the normal healing time, suggesting 3 months in case of chronic pain of benign causes.  
Women are more commonly affected , and forefoot conditions are more frequent. Persistent pain for more than 6  
years has been reported in 51% of women between 70 to 75 years of age [4]. Because of  the wide range of causes 
of chronic foot pain, assessment of these patients with imaging studies in addition to a dedicated clinical 
examination is often needed [1] .",True

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
In patients with chronic wrist pain, imaging studies are  an important adjunct to history, physical examination, 
laboratory testing, and electrophysiology studies. The choice of imaging modality depends on the patient’s 
presentation and the clinical questions being asked. There are scenarios in which no imaging beyond baseline 
radiographs is necessary, but in other situations advanced imaging has added value for diagnostic eva luation and 
treatment planning.  
Overview of Imaging Modalities  
Radiographs  
Imaging evaluation of the painful wrist should begin with radiog raphs [1,2]. This simple study may establish a 
specific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, 
impaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -
anterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or 
more oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling 
[3]. A v ariety of stress positions and maneuvers can be performed to elicit dynamic instability that is not visible 
on standard radiographs [ 4]. Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. 
Additionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ].

Bone Scan  Wrist  
Bone scan is not routinely used to further evaluate radial -sided chronic wrist pain when radiographs are normal or 
nonspecific.

early RA is proving to be the best single predictor of future disease progression and functional dete rioration, even 
compared to serologies and clinical measures [27, 28,32-34].  
US Wrist  
The diagnosis of a specific inflammatory arthritis is typically established based on clinical and laboratory 
analysis. Advanced imaging is usually performed to determine disease activity, guide management decisions, and prognosticate outcomes. In patients with RA, US  of the wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints can  show 
inflammation  as active synovitis. Identifying active synovitis with power Doppler assessment is a useful adjunct 
in making an early diagnosis of RA when a pati ent with early arthritis does not meet the 2010 criteria established 
by the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism [20]. The presence of 
synovitis predicts progression of erosions [31 ] and erosions themselves [35]. US can also depict small bone 
erosions with high spatial resolution; h owever, US is less sensitive to erosions that occur on the radial or ulnar 
sides of the inner carpal bones because direct scanning of these regions is blocked, unlike the dorsal and volar 
bone surfaces. Furthermore, unlike MRI, US cannot show changes within the bone marrow, which are  the 
strongest prognosticator s for disease progression in RA [27, 28,32-34].  In patients with established inflammatory 
arthritis who are undergoing therapy, judging progression or reduction of synovitis may be more difficult with 
sequential US compared to sequential MRI.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
MR arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected inflammatory 
arthritides. 
CT Wrist  
While CT is more sensitive than radiographs for erosions, CT is not routinely used for the diagnosis and 
management of patients with suspected inflammatory arthritides .

radiographs are usually  appropriate as an initial study. Radiographs are widely available , and for many bone,

sesamoiditis and avascular necrosis [32,33] . 
The most commonly used imaging techniques in the diagnosis of Morton’s  neuroma  are MRI and US. It has been 
shown that MRI has a significant effect in the diagnostic and therapeutic decisions made by orthopedic surgeons 
thanks to an increase in their confidence levels and change in treatment [34] . MRI is believed to be a sensitive and 
reliable method to evaluate patients with metatarsalgia and Morton’s  neuroma  with a sensitivity of 87%, specificity 
of 100%, accuracy of 89%, PPV of 100% , and NPV of 60% in surgically treated patients [35] . In a meta- analysis,  
MRI had  a pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio , and negative likelihood ratio of 93%, 68%, 1.89,  
and 0.19, respectively [36]. Increased fluid within the intermetatarsal bursa, which suggest s bursitis, is well 
demonstrated on MRI [37] . Although the use of gadolinium does not seem essential to detect Morton’s  neuroma s 
[38], it may facilitate its detection  because of  the improved soft -tissue contrast [32,39] . 
MRI is widely accepted as the imaging study  of choice for diagnosis of plantar plate tears. In a prospective study, 
Sung et al [40] found high accuracy (96%), sensitivity (95%), specificity (100%), PPV (100%), and NPV (67%) for 
MRI with surgical correlation. In this study,  moderate concordance was found between tear severity on MR I and 
surgery with greater concordance at higher severity. A meta-analysis showed higher diagnostic accuracy for MRI 
than US for the detection of plantar plate tears with sensitivity and specificity for MRI of 95% and 54%, respectively 
[41].

Bone Scan Foot  
Planar b one scintigraphy has low anatomic resolution and has been shown to be a nonspecific technique to assess 
the hallucal sesamoids [24]. However, bone scintigraphy with single -photon emission computed tomography 
(SPECT)/CT increases contrast resolution and anatomic localization of foci with increased osteoblastic activity  
[25]. Bone scintigraphy may demonstrate increased uptake in pathologic conditions affecting the fir st metatarsal 
sesamoids not evident on radiographs. A less dramatic uptake is noted in stress fractures, which may be helpful to 
differentiate between them and acute fractures [26]. When an indeter minate linear lucency is visualized on 
radiographs, a negative bone scintigraphy suggest s sesamoid bipartition [12] . Other conditions that may present 
positive findings on Tc -99m -methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scint igraphy include sesamoiditis, 
inflammatory or deposition arthropathies, osteoarthritis , and osteonecrosis [39]. In Freiberg’s infraction, a 
photopenic center with a hyperactive collar may be identified on early stages on high -resolution Tc -99m -MDP bone 
scintigraphy [27]. 
CT Foot  
CT may be useful to confirm suspected sesamoid stress fractures on radiographs and to distinguish between a stress 
fracture and a bipartite sesamoid with more precision than conventional radiography [28] .

Conventional radiography can be useful to distinguish among different causes of chronic foot pain and is usually

The value of radiographs in the diagnosis of tarsal coalitions has been extensively demonstrated. Overall 
sensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs 
in the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral 
and oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar 
coalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs 
on the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have 
been found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable 
methods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  
Radiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review 
by Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for 
radiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.  
Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic foot pain is a frequent clinical complaint with approximately 14% to 42% of adults in the United States 
reporting foot problems, often with significant impact on mobility, difficulty performing daily activities , and 
increased risk of falling, particularly in older individuals [1,2] . Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a 
significant improvement in health-related quality of life with effective treatment of foot pain [3] . Estimating the 
prevalence of chron ic foot pain is challenging, because there is no consensus regarding the definition of chronic 
pain in the literature. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines chronic pain as any pain persisting 
past the normal healing time, suggesting 3 months in case of chronic pain of benign causes.  
Women are more commonly affected , and forefoot conditions are more frequent. Persistent pain for more than 6  
years has been reported in 51% of women between 70 to 75 years of age [4]. Because of  the wide range of causes 
of chronic foot pain, assessment of these patients with imaging studies in addition to a dedicated clinical 
examination is often needed [1] .

Page Content: Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  
usually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, 
osteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite 
versus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess 
with radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton’s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other 
causes of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg’s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals 
or soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . 
Though radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in 
patients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The 
combination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a 
specificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15].

Bone Scan Foot  
Planar b one scintigraphy has low anatomic resolution and has been shown to be a nonspecific technique to assess 
the hallucal sesamoids [24]. However, bone scintigraphy with single -photon emission computed tomography 
(SPECT)/CT increases contrast resolution and anatomic localization of foci with increased osteoblastic activity  
[25]. Bone scintigraphy may demonstrate increased uptake in pathologic conditions affecting the fir st metatarsal 
sesamoids not evident on radiographs. A less dramatic uptake is noted in stress fractures, which may be helpful to 
differentiate between them and acute fractures [26]. When an indeter minate linear lucency is visualized on 
radiographs, a negative bone scintigraphy suggest s sesamoid bipartition [12] . Other conditions that may present 
positive findings on Tc -99m -methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scint igraphy include sesamoiditis, 
inflammatory or deposition arthropathies, osteoarthritis , and osteonecrosis [39]. In Freiberg’s infraction, a 
photopenic center with a hyperactive collar may be identified on early stages on high -resolution Tc -99m -MDP bone 
scintigraphy [27]. 
CT Foot  
CT may be useful to confirm suspected sesamoid stress fractures on radiographs and to distinguish between a stress 
fracture and a bipartite sesamoid with more precision than conventional radiography [28] .

There is no relevant literature  to support the routine use of CT in the evaluation of a patient with clinical suspicion 
of pathology of the plantar fascia.  
MRI Foot  
MRI allows accurate characterization of the pl antar fascia and adjacent soft -tissues and bones, and several imaging 
findin gs have been described in patients with plantar fasciitis and partial or complete tears of the plantar fascia on 
MRI [52]. Given that, some of the find ings in patients with plantar fasciitis are nonspecific; these findings can also 
be seen in asymptomatic patients.  MRI should always be correlated with clinical symptoms to avoid overcalling 
plantar fasciitis. Although no significant differences have been found in plantar fascia thickness on US and MRI, 
MRI is currently considered the most sensitive imaging study  in the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis [53]. There is no 
relevant literature supporting the routine use of contrast in the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis or tears.  
US Foot  
US has shown good sensitivity (80%) and specificity (88%) in the dia gnosis of plantar fasciitis when compared to 
MRI [54]. A diagnostic accuracy of 69% for abnormal focal echogenicity within the plantar fascia, 60% for edema 
around the plantar fascia, 78% for perifascial edema, 69% for rupture of the plantar fascia,  and 56% for an associated 
calcaneal spur have been found for US, using MRI as the reference standard [55]. Kapoor et al [56]  showed higher 
sensitivity and specificity of US elastography when compared to US in the detection of plantar fasciitis (95% and 
100% versus 66% and 75%, respectively) , using  MRI as the reference standard. US has been shown to be useful in 
the diagnosis of complete and partial tears of the plantar fascia [57]. Some authors regard US to be superior to MRI 
in differentiating true fiber interruption and tearing of the plantar fascia from edema [58].

Page Content: Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  
usually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, 
osteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite 
versus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess 
with radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton’s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other 
causes of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg’s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals 
or soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . 
Though radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in 
patients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The 
combination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a 
specificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15].

feasible.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
Direct MR arthrography (with contrast injection either into the radiocarpal joint or into all three  compartments of 
the wrist) may be appropriate in this scenario; the examination has higher sensitivity than noncontrast -enhanced 
MRI—even when performed at 3.0 T —for diagnosis of complete and incomplete scapholunate and lunotriquetral 
ligament tears [3 ,8,38]. For the scapholunate ligament, direct MR  arthrography also allows more accurate 
determination of which specific segments of the ligament are torn compared to conventional MRI [43], which has 
important biomechanical implications for wrist stability. Direct MR arthrography also has an advantage over 
noncontrast -enhanced MRI for diagnosing extrinsic ligament abnormalities [44].

complications of the fracture.  
Variant 12: Chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or nonspecific. Suspect carpal tunnel syndrome.  Next 
study. 
US Wrist 
Several meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the 
carpal  tunnel  inlet) is highly accurate for identifying carpal  tunnel syndrome  diagnosed clinically or with the 
combination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US 
varies depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the 
measurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary 
examination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel 
syndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal 
tunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, 
clinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of 
carpal tunnel syndrome. US may be appropriate in cases where this initial evaluation is equivocal.  
MRI Wrist  
Historically, carpal tunnel syndrome has been diagnosed based on clinical signs and sympt oms and confirmed by 
the results of electrodiagnostic studies [67]. MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in cases in which this  
initial evaluation is equivocal. The MRI findings that have been reported in wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome —
including nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing—may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value 
in patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68].

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
In patients with chronic wrist pain, imaging studies are  an important adjunct to history, physical examination, 
laboratory testing, and electrophysiology studies. The choice of imaging modality depends on the patient’s 
presentation and the clinical questions being asked. There are scenarios in which no imaging beyond baseline 
radiographs is necessary, but in other situations advanced imaging has added value for diagnostic eva luation and 
treatment planning.  
Overview of Imaging Modalities  
Radiographs  
Imaging evaluation of the painful wrist should begin with radiog raphs [1,2]. This simple study may establish a 
specific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, 
impaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -
anterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or 
more oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling 
[3]. A v ariety of stress positions and maneuvers can be performed to elicit dynamic instability that is not visible 
on standard radiographs [ 4]. Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. 
Additionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ].

there are no studies comparing the accuracy of the two field s trengths in the same patients. The sensitivity for 
tears of the ulnar attachment of the disc and the peripheral attachments (the ulnocarpal ligaments) are only fair 
with noncontrast -enhanced wrist MRI [ 12,36]. IV contrast seldom provides added benefit in patients with ulnar -

preferred examination for suspected distal radioulnar joint subluxation, where images of both wrists can be  
obtained in both supination and pronation [1 ,13]. A disadvantage of CT  is its lower sensitivity to soft -tissue 
abnormalities  compared with MRI.  
High-resolution (typically multidetector) CT of the wrist following contrast injection into one or more wrist 
compartments (CT arthrography) is a powerful tool for diagnosing intra -articular abnormalities [14,15]. The 
intraobserver agreement on CT arthrogram images is extremely high and better than that reported for MRI 
[14,16]. 
US 
US of the wrist is useful for examining extra -articular soft tissues, such as suspected ganglion cyst s [17], because 
its accuracy is similar to that of MRI. US can also be used to diagnose abnormalities of the flexor and extensor 
tendons and tendon sheaths. For de Quervain disease (stenosing tenosynovitis of the abductor pollicis lon gus and 
extensor pollicis brevis tendon compartment), preoperative identification of a septum or subcompartmentalization 
within the first dorsal compartment with US  may affect surgical management [18 ,19]. 
In patients with suspected or established rheumatoid arthritis (RA), US examination of the wrist and selected 
finger joints can identify erosions and active synovit is (with the use of power Doppler), findings that influence 
early diagnosis and treatment decisions [20]. Using US to measure the size of the median nerve is a  validated  
technique in patients with clinical symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome [21-24].  
In addition, w rist US is a useful technique to guide therapeutic intr a-articular and other soft -tissue injections [25].

both the flexor and extensor wrist compartments [46]. Occult ganglion cysts are also easily identified with MRI, 
but some authors recommend use of IV contrast to distinguish ganglia from synovitis [ 47]. For noncystic soft-
tissue masses, MRI may demonstrate findings that are diagnostic for certain benign conditions (eg, lipomas, 
hemangiomas, benign nerve sheath tumors), and can stage the extent of involvement for nonspecific masses ( see

US Wrist 
Several meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the 
carpal  tunnel  inlet) is highly accurate for identifying carpal  tunnel syndrome  diagnosed clinically or with the 
combination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US 
varies depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the 
measurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary 
examination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel 
syndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal 
tunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, 
clinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of 
carpal tunnel syndrome. US may be appropriate in cases where this initial evaluation is equivocal.  
MRI Wrist  
Historically, carpal tunnel syndrome has been diagnosed based on clinical signs and sympt oms and confirmed by 
the results of electrodiagnostic studies [67]. MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in cases in which this  
initial evaluation is equivocal. The MRI findings that have been reported in wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome —
including nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing—may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value 
in patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68].",True

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
In patients with chronic wrist pain, imaging studies are  an important adjunct to history, physical examination, 
laboratory testing, and electrophysiology studies. The choice of imaging modality depends on the patient’s 
presentation and the clinical questions being asked. There are scenarios in which no imaging beyond baseline 
radiographs is necessary, but in other situations advanced imaging has added value for diagnostic eva luation and 
treatment planning.  
Overview of Imaging Modalities  
Radiographs  
Imaging evaluation of the painful wrist should begin with radiog raphs [1,2]. This simple study may establish a 
specific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, 
impaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -
anterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or 
more oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling 
[3]. A v ariety of stress positions and maneuvers can be performed to elicit dynamic instability that is not visible 
on standard radiographs [ 4]. Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. 
Additionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ].

Both traumatic and degenerative lesions of the TFCC can produce chronic, ulnar -sided wrist pain . MRI is highly 
accurate for lesions involving the radial (central) zone of the disc, especially with the use of high -resolution fast 
spin-echo or 3-D grad ient-recalled pulse sequences [36]. There is some evidence suggesting that MRI performed 
with a 3.0 T system is even more accurate than MRI performed with a 1.5 T system for TFCC lesions [37], but 
there are no studies comparing the accuracy of the two field s trengths in the same patients. The sensitivity for 
tears of the ulnar attachment of the disc and the peripheral attachments (the ulnocarpal ligaments) are only fair 
with noncontrast -enhanced wrist MRI [ 12,36]. IV contrast seldom provides added benefit in patients with ulnar -
sided wrist pain but may increase sensitivity for TFCC lesions if MR arthrography is desired but direct joint 
injection is not feasible.",False

[13]. 
MRI Hip Without and With  IV Contrast  
Although MRI hip without  and with IV contrast  may be able to demonstrate pathology about  the hip, it cannot  be 
used to quantify the amount  pain that is generated  from  the hip pathology.  
MRI Hip Without IV Contrast  
Although MRI hip without  IV contrast  may be able to demonstrate pathology  about  the hip, it cannot  be used to 
quantify the amount  pain that is generated  from  the hip pathology.  
US Hip 
Although US hip may be able to demonstrate pathology about  the hip, it cannot  be used to quantify the amount  pain 
that is generated  from  the hip pathology.  
Summary  of Recommendations 
• Variant 1 : Radiography pelvis and Radiography hip are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of chronic 
hip pain. These procedures are complementary (ie, more than one procedure is ordered as a set or simultaneously 
in which each procedure provides unique clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 2 : In the setting of chronic hip pain with negative or nondiagnostic radiographs, MRI hip  without IV 
contrast or US hip  is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for suspected noninfectious extra -articular 
abnormality, such as tendonitis or bursitis.  These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure 
will be ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 3 : In the setting of chronic hip pain with negative or nondiagnostic radiographs, MR arthrography hip 
or MRI hip without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for suspected impingement or 
dysplasia. These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be ordered to provide the 
clinical informatio n to effectively manage the patient’s care).

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 10 Chronic  Hip Pain Radiography Hip Additional Views 
For further evaluation  of disorders  such as dysplasia or FAI, specialized  views such as the false  profile  or elongated  
femoral  neck  lateral  (Dunn)  views  can provide  more  detailed  evaluation  of the anatomy  of the femoral  head  and 
neck  and the degree of acetabular  coverage of the femoral  head  [47]. 
US Hip 
In general,  US is limited  in its use for evaluating  osseous structures.  However,  there is limited  literature  that 
demonstrates that US can be used to evaluate osseous features of FAI such as the alpha -angle  [73]. However,  US is 
not able to adequately  evaluate osseous abnormalities  deep  to the cortex.  One of the advantages  of US is its ability  
to dynamically  evaluate for extra-articular  soft tissue  impingement.  US is not as sensitive as MRI or CT 
arthrography  for the detection  of labral  tears  [17], but it can be useful  for the detection  and localization  of paralabral  
cysts for aspiration  and injection  [39,41] . 
Variant  4: Chronic  hip pain. Suspect  labral tear.  Radiographs  negative  or nondiagnostic. Next  imaging

Bone  Scan  Hip 
There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of bone  scan of the hip for the workup of an acetabular  labral  tear 
in a patient  with chronic  hip pain.  
CT Arthrography  Hip 
Some  authors  have  shown  that CT arthrography  can be useful  in the detection  of acetabular  labral  tears [17,74] , 
which  may be associated  with FAI, but other  authors  have  shown  that CT arthrography is not very good for the 
detection  of labral  tears [18].

US Hip 
The literature  indicates that US is useful  for the evaluation  of extra -articular  soft tissues in the region of the hip 
[23]. US can also nicely  demo nstrate fluid  collections  around the hip, such as bursitis  and paralabral  cysts.  Tendon  
pathology,  such as tendinosis , tears,  or snapping iliopsoas tendons  can also be identified  with US [38-41]. US may 
also be useful  for the dynamic  evaluation  of the iliopsoas  tendon,  such as in snapping  hip syndrome.

Pathology  associated  with femoracetabular  impingement  (FAI) may be both intra- and extra-articular . CT is often  
used for preoperative assessment  of bony anatomy  in the setting  of FAI and hip dysplasia [42-44]. CT arthrography  
has been  shown  to be sensitive  for detection  of acetabular  labral  tears [17], which  may be associated  with FAI. CT 
arthrography has also been  shown  to be more  helpful  in identifying  chondral  lesions [16] when  compared  to MRI.

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  hip pain is a common chief  complaint  for patients , reportedly affecting  30% to 40% of adults  who play 
sports  [1,2] , and 12% to 15% of all adults  over 60 [3,4] . A wide variety  of pathological  entities  may cause hip pain, 
including  osseous  as well as intra- or extra -articular  soft tissue abnormalities  [5-7]. Pathology  involving  the lumbar  
spine,  sacroiliac,  or knee  joints  can also cause hip pain [8], and these  etiologies  should  be investigated  as needed . 
There is limited  original  research  that specifically  targets the imaging  of chronic  hip pain,  but imaging  of specific  
conditions  is widely  discussed  in the published  literature. 
Before  imaging,  an appropriate  assessment  of a patient’s  clinical  history  and physical  examination  is essential  in

MRI Hip Without and With  IV Contrast  
Although MRI hip without  and with IV contrast  may be able to demonstrate pathology about  the hip, it cannot  be 
used to quantify the amount  pain that is generated  from  the hip pathology.  
MRI Hip Without IV Contrast  
Although MRI hip without  IV contrast  may be able to demonstrate pathology  about  the hip, it cannot  be used to 
quantify the amount  pain that is generated  from  the hip pathology.  
US Hip 
Although US hip may be able to demonstrate pathology about  the hip, it cannot  be used to quantify the amount  pain 
that is generated  from  the hip pathology.  
Summary  of Recommendations 
• Variant 1 : Radiography pelvis and Radiography hip are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of chronic 
hip pain. These procedures are complementary (ie, more than one procedure is ordered as a set or simultaneously 
in which each procedure provides unique clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 2 : In the setting of chronic hip pain with negative or nondiagnostic radiographs, MRI hip  without IV 
contrast or US hip  is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for suspected noninfectious extra -articular 
abnormality, such as tendonitis or bursitis.  These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure 
will be ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 3 : In the setting of chronic hip pain with negative or nondiagnostic radiographs, MR arthrography hip 
or MRI hip without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for suspected impingement or 
dysplasia. These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be ordered to provide the 
clinical informatio n to effectively manage the patient’s care).

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 10 Chronic  Hip Pain Radiography Hip Additional Views 
For further evaluation  of disorders  such as dysplasia or FAI, specialized  views such as the false  profile  or elongated  
femoral  neck  lateral  (Dunn)  views  can provide  more  detailed  evaluation  of the anatomy  of the femoral  head  and 
neck  and the degree of acetabular  coverage of the femoral  head  [47]. 
US Hip 
In general,  US is limited  in its use for evaluating  osseous structures.  However,  there is limited  literature  that 
demonstrates that US can be used to evaluate osseous features of FAI such as the alpha -angle  [73]. However,  US is 
not able to adequately  evaluate osseous abnormalities  deep  to the cortex.  One of the advantages  of US is its ability  
to dynamically  evaluate for extra-articular  soft tissue  impingement.  US is not as sensitive as MRI or CT 
arthrography  for the detection  of labral  tears  [17], but it can be useful  for the detection  and localization  of paralabral  
cysts for aspiration  and injection  [39,41] . 
Variant  4: Chronic  hip pain. Suspect  labral tear.  Radiographs  negative  or nondiagnostic. Next  imaging  
study. 
Bone  Scan  Hip 
There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of bone  scan of the hip for the workup of an acetabular  labral  tear 
in a patient  with chronic  hip pain.  
CT Arthrography  Hip 
Some  authors  have  shown  that CT arthrography  can be useful  in the detection  of acetabular  labral  tears [17,74] , 
which  may be associated  with FAI, but other  authors  have  shown  that CT arthrography is not very good for the 
detection  of labral  tears [18].

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  hip pain is a common chief  complaint  for patients , reportedly affecting  30% to 40% of adults  who play 
sports  [1,2] , and 12% to 15% of all adults  over 60 [3,4] . A wide variety  of pathological  entities  may cause hip pain, 
including  osseous  as well as intra- or extra -articular  soft tissue abnormalities  [5-7]. Pathology  involving  the lumbar  
spine,  sacroiliac,  or knee  joints  can also cause hip pain [8], and these  etiologies  should  be investigated  as needed . 
There is limited  original  research  that specifically  targets the imaging  of chronic  hip pain,  but imaging  of specific  
conditions  is widely  discussed  in the published  literature. 
Before  imaging,  an appropriate  assessment  of a patient’s  clinical  history  and physical  examination  is essential  in 
trying  to pare down the range  of possible etiologies  for a patient’s  symptoms.

chronic  hip pain [35-37]. 
US Hip 
The literature  indicates that US is useful  for the evaluation  of extra -articular  soft tissues in the region of the hip 
[23]. US can also nicely  demo nstrate fluid  collections  around the hip, such as bursitis  and paralabral  cysts.  Tendon  
pathology,  such as tendinosis , tears,  or snapping iliopsoas tendons  can also be identified  with US [38-41]. US may 
also be useful  for the dynamic  evaluation  of the iliopsoas  tendon,  such as in snapping  hip syndrome.  
Variant  3: Chronic  hip pain. Suspect  impingement  or dysplasia . Radiographs  negative  or nondiagnostic.

Bone  Scan  Hip 
There is no relevant  literature  to support  to the use of bone  scan of the hip in the evaluation  of suspected  hip 
impingement.  
CT Arthrography  Hip 
Pathology  associated  with femoracetabular  impingement  (FAI) may be both intra- and extra-articular . CT is often  
used for preoperative assessment  of bony anatomy  in the setting  of FAI and hip dysplasia [42-44]. CT arthrography  
has been  shown  to be sensitive  for detection  of acetabular  labral  tears [17], which  may be associated  with FAI. CT 
arthrography has also been  shown  to be more  helpful  in identifying  chondral  lesions [16] when  compared  to MRI.",True

Page Content: Patellofemoral car tilage loss is also associated with chronic knee pain , with active knee pain correlated with 
BMLs [30,31]. Similar to CT, MRI can calculate various anatomic measurements associated with patellofemoral 
subluxation/dislocation and lateral patellofemoral friction syndrome [32-34]. Bone marrow edema in the classic 
location for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also 
differentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise 
therapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. 
Other etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat 
pad impingement syndromes, Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome, adhesive 
capsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes , 
and osteonecrosis [15, 19,36-45].  
MRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a 
joint effusion. However, contrast -enhanced images ma y be more accurate in diagnosing other causes of chronic 
knee pain , such as Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome, and adhesive 
capsulitis [15].  In particular, enh ancing synovitis thicker than 2 mm in Hoffa’s fat is correlated with peripatellar 
pain [46]. Contrast -enhanced MRI is also useful in quantifying the degree of synovitis and in evaluating 
conditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis [ 17,42,47,48].

Bone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the 
subchondral bone.  New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or 
patients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee 
pain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the 
origin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. 
Subchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed 
spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to 
elderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs 
often initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, 
and progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is 
suspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria
® 
topic on “ Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae ” [28]. 
Some patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using 
quantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs 
exhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ].

Special Imaging  Considerations  
Knee radiographs  should include at least one frontal projection of one or both knees (anteroposterior, Rosenberg, 
or tunnel), a tangential patellar view , and a lateral view of the affected knee [2,9]. Standing radiographs more 
accurately reflect medial and lateral compartment cartilage loss than supine radiographs with the posteromedial and posterolateral joint compartments  more accurately assessed using a weight -bearing flexion posteroanterior

Summary of Literature Review  
Background/Introduction 
Chronic knee pain affects tens of millions of people  in the United States annually , with the pain sometimes highly 
disabling and often negatively impacting the patient’s quality of life. Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and 
it can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain 
with the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. 
Typically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain 
persists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  
imaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated 
that approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the 
prior year) radiographs [2 ]. 
This document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  ≥5 years of age.

BMLs [30,31]. Similar to CT, MRI can calculate various anatomic measurements associated with patellofemoral 
subluxation/dislocation and lateral patellofemoral friction syndrome [32-34]. Bone marrow edema in the classic 
location for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also 
differentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise 
therapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. 
Other etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat 
pad impingement syndromes, Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome, adhesive 
capsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes , 
and osteonecrosis [15, 19,36-45].  
MRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a 
joint effusion. However, contrast -enhanced images ma y be more accurate in diagnosing other causes of chronic 
knee pain , such as Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome, and adhesive 
capsulitis [15].  In particular, enh ancing synovitis thicker than 2 mm in Hoffa’s fat is correlated with peripatellar 
pain [46]. Contrast -enhanced MRI is also useful in quantifying the degree of synovitis and in evaluating 
conditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis [ 17,42,47,48].

Summary of Literature Review  
Background/Introduction 
Chronic knee pain affects tens of millions of people  in the United States annually , with the pain sometimes highly 
disabling and often negatively impacting the patient’s quality of life. Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and 
it can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain 
with the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. 
Typically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain 
persists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  
imaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated 
that approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the 
prior year) radiographs [2 ].

With  negative radiographs,  CT may be performed  as the next imaging study  for the evaluation  of suspected  
radiographically  occult  knee  fractures  [12] and bone  marrow  contusions  [16-18]. CT may diagnose  or predict

evaluation  of bone  marrow  lesions [27-29], meniscal  [21,26]  and ligamentous  [21,31-34]  injuries , and may be 
subsequently  performed  as clinically  indicated.

ultrashort  or zero echo  time sequences [96-98], 3-D sequences  [99], or conventional  MRI  sequences  [100]  to

Radiography Shoulder  Additional Views  
There are several  options  for additional  radiographic  views in patients  with suspected  instability  [1]. The West  Point  
and Garth  views can demonstrate the anterior  inferior glenoid at a better  advantage  in patients  with a suspected  
Bankart  fracture.  A Stryker  notch  view can sometimes demonstrate  a Hill-Sachs lesion  that is difficult  to see on 
conventional  projections.  Although these additional  projections  are used by some  practitioners , they do not usually  
alleviate  the need  for advanced  imaging.  
US Shoulder

US is reported  to be 98% sensitive and 94% specific for calcium  hydroxyapatite  in the rotator  cuff tendons  [71], 
although  identification  may be challenging if the area of calcium  deposition  is small . At times  US may have

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  shoulder  pain lasting  >6 months  is a common  presenting  complaint , particularly  in patients  ≥40 years of 
age [1]. Along with a thorough history and physical  examination,  imaging  plays  a critical  role in determining the 
source of chronic  shoul der pain.  Common pain generators in the shoulder  include  the rotator  cuff tendons,  biceps 
tendon,  labrum,  glenohumeral  articular  cartilage,  acromioclavicular  joint, bones,  suprascapular  and axillary  nerves,  
and the joint capsule/synovium.  Imaging  can help to guide  appropriate  therapy , which  can range  from  conservative  
measures such as physical  therapy  and cortico steroid  injections  to more  invasive  procedures  such as arthroscopy or 
surgery . This document  focuses on the imaging approach  to patients  with suspected  chronic  mechanical  shoulder  
pain.

Glenohumeral  osteoarthritis  is typically  well visualized  on conventional  radiographic  views,  without  the need  for 
special  views.  A standard  axillary  view can demonstrate posterior  subluxation of the humeral  head  and abnormal  
glenoid morphology in patients with severe osteoarthritis  [145-147] . A measurement  of the critical shoulder  angle  
can be drawn  on routine  AP radiographs  by measuring  the angle  between  a line along the glenoid  surface and a line 
from  the inferior glenoid to the lateral  acromial  margin;  patients  with a higher  measurement  may be at high risk of 
having a full thickness rotator  cuff tear [148] .

is able to detect  very subtle  articular  surface cuff defects,  but, because of lack of contrast  extension  from  the

Page Content: US Shoulder  
US has been  found  to have  a high accuracy  in assessing  rotator  cuff disease [38,45] , including the subscapularis  
tendon [46]. Meta-a nalyse s have  found a sensitivity  of US ranging from  85% to 95% and a specificity  ranging from  
72% to 92%, which  is similar  to nonc ontrast  MRI and slightly  lower  than MR arthrography [24,47] . Fatty  infiltration  
within  the rotator  cuff muscles can be adequately  demonstrated  with US [48]. US may; however , be less accurate  
than MRI in measuring  tear size and the degree of retraction  in larger  tears [49]. US allows excellent  evaluation  of 
the bursae situated  about  the shoulder , particularly  the subacromial  subdeltoid bursa  [50]. Color  flow imaging  can 
demonstrate hyperemia  in cases of bursitis  with a significant  inflammatory  component  [51]. 
Variant  3: Chronic  shoulder  pain. Radiogra phs demonstrate calcific  tendinopathy  or calcific bursitis.  Next  
imaging  study.  
Bone  Scan  Shoulder  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of bone  scan shoulder  in the evaluation  of chronic  shoulder  pain 
when  radiographs  demonstrate calcific tendinosis  or calcific bursitis. Cases with intraosseous extension  of calcium  
hydroxyapatite  can potentially  demonstrate  increased  radionuclide  uptake  due to bony inflammatory  change,  which  
can potentially  be confused  with a neoplastic process and result  in diagnostic  confusion.  
CT Arthrography  Shoulder

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 16 Chronic Shoulder Pain  MRI Shoulder  Without  and With  IV Contrast  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of MRI  shoulder  without  and with IV contrast  in the evaluation  of 
chronic  shoulder  pain with a history  of prior  rotator  cuff repair  when  a rotator  cuff disorder  or subacromial  
subdeltoid bursitis  is suspected.  
MRI Shoulder  Without  IV Contrast  
MRI is useful  in the evaluation  of the postoperative  rotator  cuff. The shift from  metallic  to bioabsorbable  suture  
anchors  tends  to result  in fewer  cases  with metal  artifact  implications  [153] . For patients  with meta llic suture  
anchors,  there are a variety  of commercially  available metal  artifact  reduction sequences,  which  can limit artifact.  
MRI can demonstrate  complications  with suture  anchors  such as osteolys is or migration  [154] , even  if the suture  
anchors  are nonmetallic . MRI can also demonstrate potential improvements  in muscle  atrophy and fatty infiltration  
after rotator  cuff repair  [155,156] .  
Radiography Shoulder  Additional Views  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of additional  radiographic  views in the evaluation  of chronic  
shoulder  pain with a history  of prior  rotator  cuff repair  when  rotator  cuff disorder  or subacromial  subdeltoid bursitis  
is suspected.  
US Shoulder  
An advantage  of US evaluation  of the postoperative  shoulder  is the absence  of metal -induced artifact  when  
examining the rotator  cuff and adjacent  soft tissues.  Patients  who have  undergone  rotator  cuff repair  may show  
discrete defects on US imaging  that may persist  for years with some  potential for delayed  healing  [157] .

Page Content: Despite  
these limitations, US still provides  an excellent  method  to assess repair  integrity, with a high sensitivity  (80.8%)  
and specificity  (100%)  for recurrent  rotator  cuff tear [158] . The ability  to perform  provocative  maneuvers can 
further demonstrate abnormalities  that other  forms  of imaging  would be incapable  identifying.  
Summary  of Recommendations 
• Variant 1 : Radiography is usually appropriate for the initial imaging of chronic shoulder pain.  
• Variant 2 : US or MR arthrography or MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study 
in the evaluation of chronic shoulder pain when  radiographs are normal or inconclusive and rotator cuff 
disorders or subacromial subdeltoid bursitis (no prior surgery)  is suspected . These procedures are equivalent 
alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage 
the patient’s care).  
• Variant 3 : Image -guided anesthetic +/ - corticosteroid injection  is usually appropriate as the next imaging study 
in the evaluation of chronic shoulder pain when radiographs demonstrate calcific tendinopathy or calcific bursitis. 
• Variant 4 : MR arthrography or MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study in the 
evaluation of chronic shoulder pain when radiographs are normal or inconclusive and labral pathology or shoulder instability is suspected.  These procedures a re equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be 
ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 5 : Image -guided anesthetic +/ - corticosteroid injection or MRI without IV contrast is usually 
appropri ate as the next imaging study in the evaluation of chronic shoulder pain when radiographs are normal 
or inconclusive and adhesive capsulitis is suspected.  These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one 
procedure will be ordered to provide the c linical information to effectively manage the patient’s care). Although 
the panel did not agree on recommending US because there is insufficient medical literature to conclude whether these patients would benefit from the procedure, its use may be appropri ate.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 15 Chronic Shoulder Pain  Radiography Shoulder  Additional Views  
Glenohumeral  osteoarthritis  is typically  well visualized  on conventional  radiographic  views,  without  the need  for 
special  views.  A standard  axillary  view can demonstrate posterior  subluxation of the humeral  head  and abnormal  
glenoid morphology in patients with severe osteoarthritis  [145-147] . A measurement  of the critical shoulder  angle  
can be drawn  on routine  AP radiographs  by measuring  the angle  between  a line along the glenoid  surface and a line 
from  the inferior glenoid to the lateral  acromial  margin;  patients  with a higher  measurement  may be at high risk of 
having a full thickness rotator  cuff tear [148] . 
US Shoulder  
Although secondary  signs  of osteoarthritis  such as osteophytes,  joint effusion , and intra-articular  bodies  can be seen 
with US [142] , it is not typically  performed  for this indication.  
Variant  8: Chronic  shoulder  pain. History  of prior  rotator  cuff repair.  Suspect  rotator  cuff disorders or 
subacromial  subdeltoid bursitis. Initial radiographs  normal  or inconclusive. Next  imaging  study.

with a history  of prior  rotator  cuff repair  when  rotator  cuff disorder  or subacromial  subdeltoid bursitis  is suspected.  
CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
As in the native  shoulder,  CT arthrography can be used to evaluate for rotator  cuff tear after surgery .

comparable alternative  to MR arthrography in the evaluation  of rotator  cuff tendon tears [16,17] . CT arthrography 
is able to detect  very subtle  articular  surface cuff defects,  but, because of lack of contrast  extension  from  the

A symptomatic primary shoulder arthroplasty has a wide variety of potential etiologies that includ es loosening, 
infection, periprosthetic fracture, and rotator cuff tear. Periprosthetic  fractures of the glenoid  and humerus  can occur  
intraoperatively  as well as postoperatively.  Complications  related  to surgical  technique,  such as excessive  reaming  
or impaction,  are the most  common  reasons for fractures in the intraoperative  setting,  with a reported  incidence of 
2.1%  [6]. In the postoperative setting, a 1% incidence  of periprosthetic  fractures  has been  reported;  patients’  other  
medical  comorbidities  (assessed  using the Deyo -Charlson  index)  are found to be significant  risk factors [10,19] . 
Humeral  fractures  have  been  found to be more  common than glenoid fractures.  Fractures of the acromion  and spine  
of the scapula are more  common  in the setting  of reverse total shoulder  arthroplasty  and are thought  to be related  to 
an intraoperative  complication  or, more  commonly,  chronic  stress [4]. 
3-Phase  Bone  Scan  with  SPECT  or SPECT/CT Shoulder  
There is no relevant literature to support the use of a 3 -phase bone scan with SPECT or SPECT/CT as a first-line 
imaging modality in the acutely symptomatic patient with a primary shoulder arthroplasty.  Similar  to bone  scans,  a 
3-phase bone  scan is highly sensitive for the detection  of periprosthetic  fractures  but suffers  from  low specificity.

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
There has been  a rapid  increase  in the number  of shoulder  arthroplasties,  including  partial  or complete humeral  head  
resurfacing,  hemiarthroplasty,  total shoulder  arthroplasty,  and reverse total shoulder  arthroplasty,  performed  in the 
United  States  over the past 2 decades [1]. The most  recent  published estimates have  reported  a 2.5-fold  increase in 
the number  of shoulder  arthroplasties performed  between  1998 and 2008,  from  19,000 to 47,000 [1,2] . Overall,  
total shoulder  arthroplasties are the most  common  type,  having surpassed  hemiarthroplasties in the last decade [1]. 
Most  shoulder  arthroplasties are performed  for degenerative  conditions.  Humeral  head  resurfacing  is indicated  in 
patients  with humeral  head  osteonecrosis,  large Hill-Sachs deformity,  or focal  osteoarthrosis.

Page Content: Radiography Shoulder  
Radiography  is the first and main  imaging  modality  utilized  in the evaluation  of both the symptomatic  and 
asymptomatic shoulder  arthroplasty  [10,13] . Findings on radiographs can be used to diagnose and guide further 
assessment of both osseous and high-grade rotator cuff abnormalities. Radiographs  are particularly  helpful  for the 
detection  of scapular  fractures  that can occur  with relatively  minor  trauma  in patients  with reverse shoulder  
prostheses [24]. 
US Shoulder  
US examinations  are not typically  ordered  as a first -line study for  evaluation  of pain in the setting  of shoulder  
arthroplasty.  Nevertheless,  US provides assessment of the rotator cuff integrity and is  capable of detecting  cortical  
discontinuity and step-off in the setting  of a fracture  after shoulder  arthroplasty  [25]. 
Variant  3: Symptomatic  patient  with  a primary  shoulder  arthroplasty,  infection not excluded. Additional 
imaging following radiographs.  
Infection,  including osteomyelitis  and septic arthritis, after total shoulder  arthroplasty  is an uncommon albeit  
potentially  devastating  complication, with a prevalence of 0.7%  to 2.9% . Infection  is more  common  in males and a 
younger  age group  [3,26,27] . A 97% infection -free  rate at 20 years has been  reported  [28]. Predisposing  underlying 
conditions  may include  rheumatoid  arthritis, corticosteroid  use, diabetes,  repeated  intra-articular  steroid  injections,  
and prior  shoulder  surgery  [26]. 
Infection  rates are higher  in the setting  of reverse total shoulder  arthroplasties,  with a range  of 0.8%  to 10% [29].

The presence  of glenohumeral  osteoarthritis  on initial radiographs  does not typically  require  additional  imaging  
unless additional pathology  is suspected,  such as a rotator  cuff tear or surgery  is a consideration . 
Bone  Scan  Shoulder  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of bone  scan shoulder  in the evaluation  of chronic  shoulder  pain 
when  initial radiographs  demonstrate  osteoarthritis.  
CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
CT arthrography  can be helpful  in the preoperative  planning  of total shoulder  arthroplasty  in patients  with severe 
glenohumeral  arthritis. CT arthrography  provides  excellent  imaging  of osseous detail allowing  for characterization  
of glenoid morphology,  version,  and bone  loss. Unlike  nonarthrogram  CT, CT arthrography  allows for adequate  
characterization  of a rotator  cuff tear [16,17] , which  may alter the chosen  arthroplasty  type. Arthrogram  contrast  
also outlines  the articular  cartilage surface,  demonstrating areas of cartilage  loss, which  cannot  be directly  visualized  
with conventional  CT. 
CT Shoulder  With  IV Contrast  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of CT shoulder  with IV contrast  in the evaluation  of chronic  
shoulder  pain when  initial radiographs  demonstrate  osteoarthritis.  
CT Shoulder  Without  and With  IV Contrast

immediate  postoperative  infection, has been  shown  to be similar  for both types  of surgeries [7]. The most  common

Glenohumeral  osteoarthritis  is typically  well visualized  on conventional  radiographic  views,  without  the need  for 
special  views.  A standard  axillary  view can demonstrate posterior  subluxation of the humeral  head  and abnormal  
glenoid morphology in patients with severe osteoarthritis  [145-147] . A measurement  of the critical shoulder  angle  
can be drawn  on routine  AP radiographs  by measuring  the angle  between  a line along the glenoid  surface and a line 
from  the inferior glenoid to the lateral  acromial  margin;  patients  with a higher  measurement  may be at high risk of 
having a full thickness rotator  cuff tear [148] . 
US Shoulder  
Although secondary  signs  of osteoarthritis  such as osteophytes,  joint effusion , and intra-articular  bodies  can be seen 
with US [142] , it is not typically  performed  for this indication.

Introduction/Background 
It has been  approximately  60 years since Sir John Charnl ey introduced the modern era of hip replacement  surgery  
[1]. Approximately  370,000 primary  total hip arthroplasties (THAs)  were performed  in the United  States in 2014  
[2]. Sloan  et al [2] estimated  that the volume of primary  THAs  would  increase to 635,000 procedure s annually by 
2030.  
Over  the years,  modifications  have  been  made  to attempt  to decrease  complications  such as loosening and wear  
with additional  fixation  techniques  (eg, osseointegration ) and articular  surfaces  (eg, metal  on highly  cross -linked  
polyethylene , antioxidant  doped polyethylene  liners,  metal -on-metal  [MoM], ceramic on polyethylene , and ceramic  
on ceramic articulations)  [3-5]. 
Second -generation  MoM prostheses were introduced in the late 1990s  [6]. These  prostheses were preferentially  
used for younger  patients  with osteoarthritis  [7].

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  hip pain is a common chief  complaint  for patients , reportedly affecting  30% to 40% of adults  who play 
sports  [1,2] , and 12% to 15% of all adults  over 60 [3,4] . A wide variety  of pathological  entities  may cause hip pain, 
including  osseous  as well as intra- or extra -articular  soft tissue abnormalities  [5-7]. Pathology  involving  the lumbar  
spine,  sacroiliac,  or knee  joints  can also cause hip pain [8], and these  etiologies  should  be investigated  as needed . 
There is limited  original  research  that specifically  targets the imaging  of chronic  hip pain,  but imaging  of specific  
conditions  is widely  discussed  in the published  literature. 
Before  imaging,  an appropriate  assessment  of a patient’s  clinical  history  and physical  examination  is essential  in 
trying  to pare down the range  of possible etiologies  for a patient’s  symptoms.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Fractures of the proximal femur (commonly referred to as hip fractures)  are a frequent  source of morbidity and 
mortality in elderly osteoporotic patients [1]. Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type 
result in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men 
[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs 
will continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of 
life following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays 
in diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -
and long-term mortality [6-13]. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of hip fractures is critical. Hip fractures 
cannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded on the basis of physical exam ination  alone ; therefore , imaging plays a 
key role in early  and accurate diagnosis [14] .

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
It has been  approximately  60 years since Sir John Charnl ey introduced the modern era of hip replacement  surgery  
[1]. Approximately  370,000 primary  total hip arthroplasties (THAs)  were performed  in the United  States in 2014  
[2]. Sloan  et al [2] estimated  that the volume of primary  THAs  would  increase to 635,000 procedure s annually by 
2030.  
Over  the years,  modifications  have  been  made  to attempt  to decrease  complications  such as loosening and wear  
with additional  fixation  techniques  (eg, osseointegration ) and articular  surfaces  (eg, metal  on highly  cross -linked  
polyethylene , antioxidant  doped polyethylene  liners,  metal -on-metal  [MoM], ceramic on polyethylene , and ceramic  
on ceramic articulations)  [3-5]. 
Second -generation  MoM prostheses were introduced in the late 1990s  [6]. These  prostheses were preferentially  
used for younger  patients  with osteoarthritis  [7].",True

et al [98] reported  that increased  periprosthetic  uptake  was present  in all cases of loose ning and infection  but in only 
1 (3.7%)  of 27 controls.  Kumar  et al [99] reported  that 10 of 12 (83.3%)  asymptomatic hip prostheses demonstrated  
no periprosthetic  uptake,  whereas periprosthetic  uptake  was present  around  all 28 aseptically  loosened  and all 16 
infected  devices.  Choe  at al [97] reported  that 3 of 17 (17.6%)  control  hip prostheses demonstrated  minor

(11); P < .01 and P < .001,  respectively.  
Image -Guided Anesthetic Injection  of Hip  
Intraarticular  anesthetic has been  used to evaluate painful  THAs,  primarily  to differentiate  referred  pain (especially  
from  the spine)  from  pain originating  in the hip [127] . Significant pain relief  after intraarticular  anesthetic injection  
suggests an intraarticular  cause [128,129] .

Bone  Scan  and Gallium  Scan  Hip 
The most  recent  data on bone  and gallium  scans for diagnosing periprosthetic  hip infection  are more  than 25 years

Bone  scan of the hip is sensitive but not specific for periprosthetic  hip infection.  Performing  the test as a 3-phase

There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of fluoride  PET/CT skull  base to mid-thigh  in the evaluation  of the

Image -Guided Aspiration  Hip 
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of image -guided aspiration  of the hip in the evaluation  of the 
symptomatic  hip prosthesis in the setting  of acute injury . 
MRI Hip 
MRI can demonstrate femoral  periprosthetic  fractures  and stress reactions [18]. However,  a nondis placed  fracture  
may be difficult to see on MRI if there is only mild associated  marrow edema,  and susceptibility  artifact  from  the 
prosthesis may obscure  the pertinent  findings  [72]. Pelvic  fractures  can be demonstrated.  There is no relevant 
literature documenting t he additional benefit of MRI with IV contrast, relative to noncontrast MRI, for fracture 
detection.  
US Hip 
US is limited  in its ability  to detect  periprosthetic  fracture  [73]. 
WBC  Scan  and Sulfur  Colloid Scan  Hip 
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of white  blood cell (WBC) and sulfur  colloid  of the hip imaging  in

within  2 years and 0.59%  between  2 and 10 years.  The identification  of periprosthetic  infection  is critical  to choosing  
appropriate  treatment  but diagnosis  can be challenging  [75].

CT Hip 
CT is less optimal  than MRI  for assessing  soft tissues [22]. Fractures and fluid  collections can be identified  on CT. 
Image -Guided Anesthetic +/- Corticosteroid  Injection  Hip Joint  or Surrounding  Structures  
If trochanteric bursitis  is thought  to be a source of pain,  Robbins  et al [144]  suggest  the bursa  may be injected  with 
either  lidocaine  alone  as a diagnostic  test, or in combination with a corticosteroid  as a therapeutic measure.  
MRI Hip 
MRI can be used to assess peritrochanteric structures including  the gluteus  minimus  and medius  muscles,  abductor  
tendons,  and the trochanteric bursa [146,147] . There is no relevant literature documenting the additional benefit of 
MRI with IV contrast, relative to noncontrast MRI, in this population.

Joint  distension  and decompression  of synovitis  into the greater  trochanteric bursa  and fluid  undermining the hip

Radiographic  Arthrography  Hip 
Weakness or detachment  of the abductor  muscles may occur  after THA using  an anterolateral  approach  [148] . 
Avulsion of the reattached  gluteus  medius  can provide  a communication between  the hip joint and the trochanteric 
bursa  that can be documented on arthrography [148] . Ylinen  et al [148]  found that all 14 patients  with this 
communication had abductor  avulsion  at revision  surgery.  A negative  study  did not exclude disruption  (sensitivity  
60.1%,  specificity  100%).  The failure  of contrast  to extend to the trochanteric region in these cases was attributed  
to blocking of its flow by a fibrous  capsule.

Special Imaging  Considerations   
In some  patients with knee  arthroplasties,  repeated  hemarthroses are caused  by synovial  hyperemia  or true 
arteriovenous  malformations.  These patients can be successfully  diagnosed with angiography and treated  with 
embolization. In rare instances,  geniculate and popliteal vessel  injuries  may occur  during surgery  [15]. 
A recent  study reports  single -photon emission  CT (SPECT)/CT  arthrography with Tc-99m  sulfur  colloid  has a high 
diagnostic  accuracy  (97%)  in the evaluation  of loosening of both hip and knee  arthroplasties in patients with 
persistent  postprocedural  pain [16]. Barnsley  et al [17] also found  arthrography  with SPECT/CT to be an accurate  
means of identifying  aseptic prosthetic  joint loosening .

Page Content: Severe instability  can result  in 
dislocation. In a 2014 review of 781 cases of prosthesis failure,  Sharkey  et al [12] found that instability  represented  
the third  most  common  cause of prosthesis failure  overall,  accounting  for 7.5%  of all cases.  The concepts of 
instability, malalignment, and loosening in TKA are closely  interrelated  [117] . When  malalignme nt of the joint is 
created  at the time of surgery,  minor  degrees of instability  can become a significant  problem.  By the same  token,  
instability, ongoing over time, can give rise to malalignment, which,  in turn, can lead to loosening.  Although 
ligamentous  balance/imbalance plays  a role in joint instability, it is not the only factor  accounting for stability  [118] . 
3-Phase  Bone  Scan  Knee  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  routine  use of Tc-99m  3-phase bone  scans for the assessment  of instability.  
Bone  scintigraphy may be helpful  in diagnosing loosening,  especially  when  obtained many  years after surgery  [62]. 
This delay  in maximum utility  is because of  the observation that positive  bone  scans are noted in 20% of 
asymptomatic knees 1 year after surge ry and in 12.5%  of individuals  2 years after surgery [61] . Serial  bone  scans 
may be more  helpful  than a single  examination  [119] . Generally,  increased  uptake  on the delayed  images  but not 
on the blood- pool phase is thought  to be due to loosening rather  than to infection  [60]. Normal  scans are most  
helpful  and are characterized  by a high NPV,  indicating  that loosening or infection  is unlikely.  A potential false  
negative ; however,  may occur  if there is loosening at the cement –prosthetic  interface that does not incite  new bone

positio n and stability  of the prosthesis.  
3-Phase  Bone  Scan  Knee  
Radionuclide  3-phase bone  scans can demonstrate  increased  activity  at a site of periprosthetic  fracture  and can show  
fractures that are radiographically occult  [137, 138]. In older  osteopen ic individuals  with low rates  of bone  
remodeling,  it may take 48 to 72 hours  for the development  of increased  radionuclide  activity  at the site of fracture.  
Within  1 to 2 years after prosthesis surgery,  the differential  diagnosis  for increased  periprosthetic  activity  would  
include  postoperative  change;  however,  with serial  imaging,  this postoperative activity  should decrease over time,  
whereas activity  increasing  over time would be suggestive of a prosthetic  complication, such as a periprosthetic  
fracture,  aseptic loosening,  or infection. Therefore,  no conclusion should  be drawn  on an isolated  bone  scan unless 
it yields  a normal  study.  
CT Arthrography  Knee  
There is no benefit  to intraarticular  contrast.  
CT Knee  With  IV Contrast  
IV contrast  is not helpful  for CT assessment  of periprosthetic  fracture.  
CT Knee  Without and With  IV Contrast  
IV contrast  is not helpful  for CT assessment  of periprosthetic  fracture.  
CT Knee  Without IV Contrast  
Radiographically occult  fractures may be detected  on CT when  metal  artifact  reduction  techniques  are used [20].

patients  report  ongoing pain or are not satisfied  with the result  [9]. Factors,  which  contribute  to patient

[10]. Most  TKA  patients  expe rience improved outcomes  and long implant survival,  with long-term  TKA failure  
rates of <1% per year [5]. The growth in the number  of primary  TKA  procedures  has been  accompanied  by increased  
rates of TKA revision  procedures  [1]. Revision  procedures  for TKAs have  increased  by 5.4 procedures  per 100,000  
persons  per decade over the period from  1990  to 2002,  with a mean  revision  burden of 8.2%  [11]. Nearly  1.5 million  
of those  with primary  knee  replacement  are 50 to 69 years  of age, underscoring a large population at risk for revision  
surgery  and long-term  complications  [5]. Sharkey  et al [12] reviewed  781 revision  TKAs and found  the most  
common  failure  mechanisms  were  loosening (39.9%),  infection  (27.4%),  instability  (7.5%),  periprosthetic  fracture  
(4.7%),  and arthrofibrosis  (4.5%) . Infection  was the most  common  reason  for early  revision  (<2 years after the 
initial TKA) , and aseptic loosening was the most  common  reason  for late revision.  Compared  with a review  
performed  by the same  author  in 2002 [13], polyethylene  wear  is no longer  the major  cause  of failure , and the 
percentages of revisions  for polyethylene  wear,  instability, arthrofibrosis,  malalignment,  and extensor  mechanism  
deficiency  have  all decreased.

US Knee  
US has a limited  role in the workup of periprosthetic  infection, but it can be readily  used to assess soft tissues,

a specificity  of 81% to 86% for the diagnosis  of prosthetic  knee  infection  when  a cutoff  of ≥13.5 mg/L  is used [44]. 
Although CRP  can be elevated  after surgery,  under  normal  circumstances  it generally  returns  to baseline within  2 
months  [44]. A large multicenter  study found CRP  and joint aspiration  to be the most  useful  tools  to diagnose

abnormal  results  for at least 2 of 3 tests (CRP  [cutoff  0.93 mg/L],  ESR [cutoff 27 mm/h],  and fibrinogen  [cutoff  
432 mg/dL])  led to accurate results for the diagnosis  of infection  (sensitivity, 93%;  specificity,  100%;  accuracy,  
97%) . More  recently,  interle ukin-6  has also shown  promise  for diagnosing  infection , with higher  predictive  values

recommend  the use of ESR, CRP , and serum  interleukin -6 testing  for patients  being assessed  for periprosthetic  joint

the most  common organisms  associated  with these infections  [46]. Both  clinical  findings  and laboratory tests may 
serve useful  in addition  to imaging  studies.  Low-grade  or chronic  TKA  infections  may be difficult to diagnose  
preoperatively.  Duff  et al [18] noted that diagnosis  of infection  was not obvious  in 53% of knees before  revision  
arthroplasty.  Pain is the most  common  presenting  symptom  of infection, but pain is a nonspecific finding [47]. In 
acute infection,  findings  such as pain,  swelling,  warmth,  erythema,  and fever  are common,  whereas chronic  
infections  may be manifested  by pain alone  [44]. Night  pain or pain at rest is characteristic of infection, whereas  
pain on weightbearing  is more  characteristic of mechanical  loosening.  Some  authors  suggest  that infection  needs to 
be excluded  in all patients  with pain persisting  >6 months  after joint replacement  [18]. 
Laboratory findings  in the setting  of TKA infection  are often  nonspecific.  Peripheral  leukocyte  counts  are not

Not only is radiography  useful  to evaluate  for bone  tumor  recurrence,  but it is also an invaluable  adjunct  to MRI 
interpretation.  When  hardware  is present,  even  with modern  metal -artifact  reduction  techniques,  radiography  can 
visualize  the bone -metal  or bone -cement  interface , which  can be critical  to evaluate  for tumor  recurrence.  
Radiographs  are recommended  for the surveillance  of local  recurrence  of malignant  or aggressive  primary  bone  
tumors.  
US Area  of Interest  
US is not useful  for evaluating  bone  lesions  when  there  is no extraosseous  tumor  extension.  However,  US may be 
beneficial  if a mass  is identified  clinically.  There  is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of US as surveillance  
for asymptomatic  local  recurrence  of malignant  or aggressive  primary  bone  tumors.

The body regions covered in this clinical scenario are abdomen, ankle, chest, elbow,  shoulder , thigh, foot, forearm, 
hand, arm, knee, pelvis, leg, and wrist.  
Local  recurrence  rates  of soft tissue  sarcomas  have  been  reported  to occur  at rates  of 5% to 25% in larger  historic  
studies  [69-72]. Although  rates  of local  recurrence  following  primary  resection  depend  on tumor  histology  and 
grade,  several  other  factors  have  been  identified  that increase  risk.

A meta -analysis  of FDG -PET/CT  for the staging  of patients  with osteosarcoma  demonstrated  an overall  sensitivity  
of 93% and a specificity  of 97% for detection  of bone  metastases  [6]. Coverage  of a whole  body  FDG -PET/CT  
varies  and usually  extends  either  from  skull  base to thighs  or skull  vertex  to feet. A study  of FDG -PET/CT  in 
patients  with sarcoma  and melanoma  showed  inclusion  of the entire  lower  extremities  does not add additional  
benefit  in identifying  metastases  [31]. 
FDG -PET/CT  is considered  superior  to Tc-99m bone  scan in the detection  of osseous  metastases.  Literature  has 
concluded  this in both general  oncologic  and bone  sarcoma  populations  [30]. FDG -PET/C T is also superior  to CT 
imaging  in this regard.  Quartuccio  et al [22] studied  64 pediatric  patients  with bone  sarcoma  and found  greater  
accuracy  of FDG -PET/CT  (85%  accuracy)  versus  CT (44% accuracy)  in detecting  bone  metastases  during  initial

aggressive  bone  tumors,  with postrecurrence  5-year survival  rates  reported  approximately  15% to 30% in patients  
with osteosarcoma  and 5% in patients  with Ewing  sarcoma  [60,62] . Factors  associated  with poorer  prognosis  in 
patients  with osteosarcoma  were  size of local  recurrence  (>5 cm) and presence  of distant  metastasis  [60]. 
Recommendations  for local  recurrence  surveillance  imaging  vary amongst  expert  guidelines,  although  all 
acknowledge  the benefit  of clinical  evaluation.  Locally  recurrent  bone  tumors  can often  present  as a soft tissue  
mass,  and in a study  of osteosarcoma  local  recurrences,  the majority  (approximately  75%)  were  soft tissue  masses  
rather  than bone  lesions  [60]. Some  guidelines  recommend  clinical  exam ination  to be performed  solely , whereas  
others  recommend  in combination  with imaging  [49,51,52,63] . Time  to recurrence  also varies  with tumor  histology.  
Most  osteosarcoma  local  recurrences  have  been  shown  to occur  within  5 years  of resection.  However,  late 
recurrence  of both osteosarcoma  and Ewing  sarcoma  have  been  reported  [60,61] . In a study  of locally  recurrent

Relevant information from the patient profile includes the patient's age (80 years old), symptoms (low back pain for 5 days), previous diagnosis (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, right breast cancer post simple mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy 20 years ago), and current findings (L1 moderate compression fracture, osteopenia, and mild lumbar spondylosis). This is the initial imaging for the current episode of low back pain.

2. According to the context, for low back pain with or without radiculopathy, in an elderly individual with osteoporosis, the initial imaging procedures that are usually appropriate include radiography lumbar spine, MRI lumbar spine without IV contrast, and CT lumbar spine without IV contrast. MRI lumbar spine without and with IV contrast is considered to be ""may be appropriate"". 

3. Given the patient's age and history of cancer, an MRI without and with IV contrast could be useful in evaluating for potential malignancy. However, considering the patient's current findings and the fact that she has already had an X-ray showing a compression fracture and osteopenia, an MRI without IV contrast might be a more favorable risk-benefit ratio as it can provide detailed images of the spine and surrounding tissues without the risks associated with IV contrast.

Page Content: A prospective  cohort  study of 20 patients  showed  no significant differences in MRI changes over 12 
months  in patients  presenting  with acute LBP compared  with their asymptomatic counterparts , except  in disc 
herniation,  nerve  root compression,  and annular  fissure [15]. Even  in the setting  of disc herniation,  imaging  may 
have  limited  role in management  as the majority  of disc herniations  show  some  degree of reabsorption  or regression  
by 8 weeks after symptom onset  [16]. It is important  to note that repeat  imaging  in patients  with new episodes of 
LBP and previous  MRI scans are unlikely  to detect  differences in disc protrusion,  annular  fissures,  high-intensity  
zones,  or end-plate  signal  changes [13]. 
Despite the lack of evidence to support  imaging early  or prior  to conservative treatment  for LBP, there is significant  
variation  in the ordering practices of physicians,  with nonadherance  to guidelines  leading  to increased  health  care 
utilization  [17,18] . A retrospective cohort  study of 145,320  patients ≥66 years of age  with acute nonspecific  LBP, 
revealed  27.2%  received  radiography  and 11.1%  received  CT or MRI within  4 weeks of the initial primary  care 
provider  visit [18]. A prospective  population-based  cohort  study  of 1,770 patients  with acute occupational  LBP 
showed  that 336 (19.0%)  received  lumbar  MRI within  6 weeks of presentation  (nonadherent  to guidelines).  This 
nonadherent  group had an increased  likelihood  of lumbosacral  injections  or surgery  for outpatient, inpatient, and 
nonmedical  services,  and disability  compensation  [17]. Increased  health  care utilization  with early  imaging  has also 
been  demonstrated  in nonworker  populations  [6].

abnormal  marrow  signal  are suggestive  of pathologic  fracture  [58]. 
Radiography Lumbar  Spine  
In patients  with history  of osteoporosis  or steroid  use, initial evaluation  with radiography  is useful  [55]. Radiography  
with anteroposterior  and lateral  radiographs  is useful  for assessing  LBP in patients  with low suspicion  of trauma  or 
minor  trauma  and patients  suspected  of having possible vertebral  compression  fracture.  Upright  radiographs  provide  
useful  functional  information  about  axial  loading.  Flexion  and extension  views can be performed  to evaluate for 
spine  stability. Evaluation  of the extent  of vertebral  body  comminution  is limited  on radiography,  particularly  in

Previous  guidelines  have  suggested  that imaging  be performed  in adults  >50 years of age who present  with LBP. 
When  studied,  there was no statistically  significant  difference in primary  outcome  after 1 year for patients  aged  65 
years or older  who had spine  imaging  within  6 weeks after an initial  visit for care for LBP versus similar  patients  
who did not undergo early  imaging  [9]; thus,  this document  does not include  >50 years of age as an independent  
red flag. However, an important age-related risk factor for spinal fracture presenting as LBP  is osteoporosis.  As 
bone mass decreases slowly over time, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age, and differs by sex, race, 
ethnicity  [10], and comorbidities.

Page Content: In line with the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations for patients  
ages 65 and older being screened for osteoporosis, patients  >65 years of age may be considered at risk for 
osteoporotic fracture when presenting with LBP . 
Additionally,  for those  patients without  neurologic  compromise  and who present  with minor  risk factors for cancer,  
inflammatory  back  disease  (eg, ankylosing spondylitis), vertebral  compression  fracture,  or symptomatic  spinal  
stenosis,  imaging  should be considered  after a trial of therapy  [4]. 
In the majority  of patients, no specific pathology for LBP can be identified. Also,  studies have  shown  imaging  
abnormalities  in a substantial  number  of people  without back  pain [11-13]. The challenge for the clinician, therefore,  
is to distin guish the small  segment  within  this large patient  population that should be evaluated  further because of 
suspicion  of a more  serious  problem  or identify  pathology that requires intervention . 
Other  nonspine  causes of LBP can have overlap  in clinical  presentation,  including inflammatory  arthritis  and other  
systemic conditions , such as pelvic,  renal,  vascular,  or gastrointestinal  etiologies.  If an inflammatory  etiology  is 
suspected  as the cause of LBP, such as ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic  spondylitis, reactive arthritis, or 
inflammatory  bowel  disease– related  spine  disorders,  please see the ACR  Appropriateness Criteria® topic  on

Special Imaging  Considerations  
Knee radiographs  should include at least one frontal projection of one or both knees (anteroposterior, Rosenberg, 
or tunnel), a tangential patellar view , and a lateral view of the affected knee [2,9]. Standing radiographs more 
accurately reflect medial and lateral compartment cartilage loss than supine radiographs with the posteromedial and posterolateral joint compartments  more accurately assessed using a weight -bearing flexion posteroanterior 
radiograph [9,10].

Bone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the 
subchondral bone.  New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or 
patients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee 
pain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the 
origin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. 
Subchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed 
spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to 
elderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs 
often initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, 
and progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is 
suspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria
® 
topic on “ Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae ” [28]. 
Some patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using 
quantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs 
exhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ].

Summary of Literature Review  
Background/Introduction 
Chronic knee pain affects tens of millions of people  in the United States annually , with the pain sometimes highly 
disabling and often negatively impacting the patient’s quality of life. Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and 
it can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain 
with the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. 
Typically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain 
persists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  
imaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated 
that approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the 
prior year) radiographs [2 ]. 
This document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  ≥5 years of age.

MRI is not routinely used in the evaluation of lesions that are definitely benign on radiographs. If such lesions are 
symptomatic, MR I may be useful to identify unusual complications , such as stress fracture, secondary aneurysmal 
bone cyst formation,  or malignant transformation [ 13].

Bone scan is not routinely used in the evaluation of lesions that are definitely benign on radiographs. There is no 
relevant literature regarding the use of Tc-99m bone scan in the evaluation of definitely benign primary bone 
tumors.

literature regarding the use of US in the evaluation of definitely benign primary bone tumors.  
Variant 4:  Suspect primary bone tumor. Radiographs or clinical presentation suggest osteoid  osteoma. 
Next imaging study.  
CT Area of Interest  
CT is considered the optimal  imaging modality  in patients with suspected osteoid osteoma.  CT is pre ferred over 
MRI when osteoid osteoma is strongly suspected because it is extremely sensitive for detection and precise 
delineation of the  nidus [14], which is important both for diagnosis and treatment . In a study including 19 patients 
with histologically proven  osteoid osteoma who underwent CT and MRI before excision of the lesion, Assoun et 
al [15] found that CT was more accurate than MRI in detection of the osteoid osteoma nidus in 63% of cases .  
There is no relevant literature specifically regarding the use of CT without and with  IV contrast in the evaluation 
of suspected primary bone tumor with negative or equivocal radiographs or radiographs that do not explain 
symptoms.  However, if contrast is given, CT without and with IV contrast is preferred because it allows 
differentiation of areas of contrast enhancement from areas of osseous matrix production.

Bone scan is sensitive for the detection of osteoid osteoma but lacks specificity. Single -photon emission 
computed tomography  (SPECT) or SPECT/CT may help improve specificity  [19].

the use of US in the evaluation of suspected osteoid osteoma.  
Variant 5 : Suspect primary bone tumor. Lesion on r adiographs . Indeterminate or aggressive appearance 
for malignancy. Next imaging study.  
Lesions seen on radiographs that are not definitely benign often require additional characterization using 
advanced imaging studies such as MRI or CT.  The next best imaging examination is not always clearly defined 
because the choice will be influenced by the radiographic appearance of the lesion, location , number of lesions, 
availability of imaging equipment, plan for biopsy/treatment , as well as underlying patient -specific clinical 
parameters.  
CT Area of Interest  
CT continues to play a role in the evaluation of indeterminate bone l esions discovered on radiographs, particularly 
in lesions with mineralized matrix or in suspected cases of osteoid osteoma (see Variant 4). Both MRI and CT 
have been used to evaluate the degree of cortical involvement in chondroid lesions [ 20]. In comparison with 
radiographs and MRI, CT has been shown to better delineate the presence of cortical destruction and the character 
of matrix mineralizatio n patterns in patients with clear cell chondrosarcoma [21].

in the setting of suspected osteoid osteoma.  A comparative study looking at CT perfusion parameters of 15 
patients with a final diagnosis of osteoid osteoma, 15 patients with lesions that mimic osteoid osteomas,  and 26 
patients with other bone lytic lesions showed that  enhancement curve morphology of the osteoid osteoma s was 
significantly different from its mimickers. All osteoid osteomas had early enhancement with a delay between 
nidus and arterial peak below 30 seconds. Eighty percent  of the mimickers demonstrated a  slow and progressive 
pattern of enhancement. The perf usion parameters of the other lytic bone lesions were similar to those of the

FDG-PET/CT is not routinely used in the evaluation of suspected osteoid osteoma. There is no relevant literature

MRI Area of Interest  
MRI is generally considered inferior to CT in the evaluation of suspected osteoid osteoma because it may fail to 
demonstrate the typical nidus and can present a confounding imaging appearance . Davies et al [17] performed a 
retrospective review of the MRI findings of 43 patients wi th osteoid osteoma and then compared the results with 
those of other imaging modalities.  The authors found that the potential for a missed diagnosis of osteoid osteoma 
on MRI was 35%.  They cautioned that osteoid osteoma may be difficult to identify on MRI and the imaging 
features may be easily misinterpreted . In a study including 19 patients with histologically proven osteoid osteoma 
who underwent CT and MRI before excision of the lesion, Assoun et al [15] found that MRI was better than CT 
in showing intramedullary and soft -tissue changes in all cases.

Shoulder dislocation or instability is most co mmon in the anterior direction. Younger patients are more likely to

patients are more likely to have rotator cuff tears in association with shoulder dislocation [ 55]. Coexisting 
humeral avulsion of the glenohumeral ligament and significant glenoid bone loss have been found in up to 10% of 
patients with recurrent shoulder instability [ 56], which underscores the need to assess both osseous and 
labroligamentous pathology in patients with shoulder dislocation or instability. Glenoid morphology and bone 
loss can play a significant factor in recurrent shoulder dislocations [15, 16,57], which may require bone grafting in 
order to restore stability [ 57].

Appropriately positioned  radiographs can exclude shoulder dislocation and most displaced fractures as the

MRI Shoulder  
Noncontrast MRI is a reasonable imaging study in the setting of acute nonlocalized traumatic shoulder pain and 
noncontributory radiographs. In the acute trauma setting, noncontrast MRI may be preferred to MR arthrography , 
as acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint effusion for assessment of intra -articular 
soft-tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic 
pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [34,35]. MRI is also sensitive for diagnosing bone marrow 
contusion and has  been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries in pediatric patients [ 36,37]. 
MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography has been found to be superior to noncontrast MRI in the diagnosis of labroligamentous and 
partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [17,19]. In the acute trauma setting, however, noncontrast MRI may be 
preferred to MR arthrography because acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint

extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [ 34,35]. MRI is also sensitive

Radiographs are the preferred initial study performed in the setting of traumatic shoulder pain . They can delineate 
shoulder malalignment and most shoulder fractures [ 4,5]. A standard set of shoulder radiographs for trauma 
should include at least three  views: anterior -posterior (AP) views in internal and external rotation and an axillary 
or scapula-Y view. Axillary or scapula-Y views are vital in evaluating traumatic shoulder injuries as 
acromioclavicular and glenohumeral dislocations can be misclassified on AP  views [6,7]. Radiographs provide 
good delineation of bony anatomy to assess for fracture and appropriate shoulder alignment, which are the two 
primary concerns in management of acute traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs should also be performed upright 
since malalignment of the shoul der can be under -represented on supine radiographs [ 4]. Additional views, such as 
the Bernageau view, have been sho wn to be effective in demonstrating the degree of bone loss of the glenoid or 
humeral head [ 8].

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Traumatic shoulder pain is shoulder pain believed to be directly attributed to a traumatic event, either acute or 
chronic. This pain may be the result of either fracture (the clavicle, scapula, or proximal humerus) or soft -tissue 
injury (most commonly of the rotator cuff, acromioclavicular ligaments, or labroligamentous complex). The 
incidence of traumatic shoulder injuries is difficult to determine because some injury types, such as low-grade 
acromioclavicular separations or acute rotator cuff tears, are likely under -reported because patients  do not seek 
immediate medical treatment. However, as with many traumatic injuries, traumatic shoulder pain tends to 
disproportionately involve young adults and male patients [ 1,2]. 
The etiology of traumatic shoulder pain can often be made based on clinical examination, radiographs, and 
mechanism of injury. Traumatic shoulder injuries can generally be separated into in juries requiring acute surgical 
management and injuries in which conservative management can be attempted prior to considering surgical 
treatment. Unstable or significantly displaced fractures and joint instability are injuries most likely requiring acute 
surgical treatment.",True

There is no defined role for US  in evaluation of proximal humeral  fractures. Although fractures may sometimes 
be visible on US as areas of cortical interruption, US  is unable to reliably characterize fracture patterns. In ideal 
conditions, US is effective at identifying full-thickness rotator cuff tears that may be associated with humeral head 
fractures [17,22,44]. However, in the acute setting of humeral head fractur e, an US examination of the shoulder is 
significantly limited by decreased patient mobility and swelling. 
FDG -PET/CT  Skull Base to Mid-Thigh 
FDG-PET in combination with CT  has been shown to be reliable in differentiating benign from malignant 
pathologic fr actures [27]. FDG-PET/CT can be used to further assess suspected pathologic fractures of the 
proximal humerus.  
Bone Scan  Shoulder  
Bone scintigraphy has sensitivity and specificity comparable to MRI in diagnosis of occult bone fractures, and 
bone scintigraphy can be used  to identify other foci of bone involvement in pathologic fractures due to metastatic 
disease  [31,32]. Bone scintigraphy can be used  to characterize proximal humerus fractures suspected to be due to 
metastatic disease.  
Variant 4: Traumatic shoulder pain. Radio graphs show scapula fracture.  Next imaging study. 
There is no consensus on indications for surgical fixation of scapula fractures. In general, isolated scapula body 
fractures heal well without surgical fixation, although associated rib fractures or higher injury severity score are 
associated with worse clinical outcomes and may benefit from more aggressive surgical fixation [ 45]. Scapula 
fractures involving the glenoid articular surface or glenoid neck may also require surgical fixation.  
CT Shoulder  
Because of the scapula’s complex osteology and overlying ribs, scapula fractures can be easily missed or 
underappreciate on conventional radiographs.

study. 
Appropriately positioned  radiographs can exclude shoulder dislocation and most displaced fractures as the 
etiology for post -traumatic shoulder pain. In the setting of normal shoulder radiographs, the most common causes 
of post -traumatic shoulder pain are soft -tissue injuries such  as rotator cuff and labral tears.  
MRI Shoulder  
Noncontrast MRI is a reasonable imaging study in the setting of acute nonlocalized traumatic shoulder pain and 
noncontributory radiographs. In the acute trauma setting, noncontrast MRI may be preferred to MR arthrography , 
as acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint effusion for assessment of intra -articular 
soft-tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic 
pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [34,35]. MRI is also sensitive for diagnosing bone marrow 
contusion and has  been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries in pediatric patients [ 36,37]. 
MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography has been found to be superior to noncontrast MRI in the diagnosis of labroligamentous and 
partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [17,19]. In the acute trauma setting, however, noncontrast MRI may be 
preferred to MR arthrography because acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint 
effusion for assessment of intra-arti cular soft -tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing 
extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [ 34,35]. MRI is also sensitive 
for diagnosing bone marrow contusion and has been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries

Variant 6: Traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs normal.  Physical examination and history consistent

Shoulder dislocation or instability is most co mmon in the anterior direction. Younger patients are more likely to 
have labroligamentous injury and persistent instability after dislocation compared with older patients [54]. Older 
patients are more likely to have rotator cuff tears in association with shoulder dislocation [ 55]. Coexisting 
humeral avulsion of the glenohumeral ligament and significant glenoid bone loss have been found in up to 10% of 
patients with recurrent shoulder instability [ 56], which underscores the need to assess both osseous and 
labroligamentous pathology in patients with shoulder dislocation or instability. Glenoid morphology and bone 
loss can play a significant factor in recurrent shoulder dislocations [15, 16,57], which may require bone grafting in 
order to restore stability [ 57].

Radiography Shoulder  
Radiographs are the preferred initial study performed in the setting of traumatic shoulder pain . They can delineate 
shoulder malalignment and most shoulder fractures [ 4,5]. A standard set of shoulder radiographs for trauma 
should include at least three  views: anterior -posterior (AP) views in internal and external rotation and an axillary 
or scapula-Y view. Axillary or scapula-Y views are vital in evaluating traumatic shoulder injuries as 
acromioclavicular and glenohumeral dislocations can be misclassified on AP  views [6,7]. Radiographs provide 
good delineation of bony anatomy to assess for fracture and appropriate shoulder alignment, which are the two 
primary concerns in management of acute traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs should also be performed upright 
since malalignment of the shoul der can be under -represented on supine radiographs [ 4]. Additional views, such as 
the Bernageau view, have been sho wn to be effective in demonstrating the degree of bone loss of the glenoid or 
humeral head [ 8].

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Traumatic shoulder pain is shoulder pain believed to be directly attributed to a traumatic event, either acute or 
chronic. This pain may be the result of either fracture (the clavicle, scapula, or proximal humerus) or soft -tissue 
injury (most commonly of the rotator cuff, acromioclavicular ligaments, or labroligamentous complex). The 
incidence of traumatic shoulder injuries is difficult to determine because some injury types, such as low-grade 
acromioclavicular separations or acute rotator cuff tears, are likely under -reported because patients  do not seek 
immediate medical treatment. However, as with many traumatic injuries, traumatic shoulder pain tends to 
disproportionately involve young adults and male patients [ 1,2]. 
The etiology of traumatic shoulder pain can often be made based on clinical examination, radiographs, and 
mechanism of injury. Traumatic shoulder injuries can generally be separated into in juries requiring acute surgical 
management and injuries in which conservative management can be attempted prior to considering surgical 
treatment. Unstable or significantly displaced fractures and joint instability are injuries most likely requiring acute 
surgical treatment.",True

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
A variety  of benign and malignant  processes may present  clinically  as a soft tissue  mass.  The behavior  of a mass,  
whether  nonaggressive,  indeterminant,  or aggressive,  can often  be discerned  based  on history  and physical  
examination.  However,  when  a benign clinical diagnosis  cannot  be confidently provided,  further  characterization  
of a soft tissue mass  with imaging  is warranted  [1]. Urgent  imag ing requests should be sought  for masses  that are 
>5 cm in diameter,  deep  in location, or have  shown  rapid  growth [2]. Modern imaging  techniques  allow  for a 
detailed  analysis of the morphology  of a soft tissue mass  as well as further insight  into its biologic  activity , which  
informs  the interpreter  on diagnosis  and appropriate  next steps in management  [3,4].  
The purpose  of this document  is to identify  the most  appropriate  imaging  study(ies)  to order  for the assessment  of 
a soft tissue  mass  based  on the most  frequently encountered  clinical  scenarios in medical  practice.

Radiography Area  of Interest  
Initial imaging  assessment  of a suspected  musculoskeletal  soft tissue mass  should almost  invariably  begin with 
radiographic  evaluation  and is advocated  by ESMO -EURACAN [9]. Radiographs  remain  the modality  best suited  
for the initial assessment  of a suspected  soft tissue mass  and are the initial study  of choice for orthopedic  oncologists  
[25,26] . However,  radiographs  have  limitations  and may not reveal  an abnormality  when  a mass is small, deep -
seated,  nonmineralized,  or in an area with complex  anatomy  such as the flank,  paraspinal  region,  groin,  or deep  soft 
tissues of the hands  and feet [11]. 
US Area  of Interest  
The diagnostic  accuracy  of US is considerably  less when  lesions outside  the subcutaneous tissue are included.  It is 
also less reliable  for defining deep  masses in large anatomical  areas [27]. Although a recent  prospective  study of 
US accuracy  in the characterization  of 134 histologically  proven  deep  soft tissue masses showed  promising results,  
there were only a small  number  of malignancies in the study cohort , and the investigators  had a high level  of US 
expertise [28].

Image -Guided Fine  Needle Aspiration  Area  of Interest  
The l iterature  does not support  the use of image -guided fine needle aspiration  as the initial examination  for a soft 
tissue mass.  At least 20% to 25% of soft tissue masses can demonstrate  features that allow  for confident  diagnosis  
based  on MRI alone  [23], many  of which  are benign and thus would not warrant  fine needle aspiration.  Therefore,  
diagnost ic imaging  that includes  comprehensive  characterization  of the mass should routinely  be performed  before  
biopsy.  In fact, the National  Comprehensive  Cancer  Network  Clinical Practice  Guidelines in Oncology for Soft 
Tissue Sarcoma state that biopsy or fine needle aspiration  should be performed  only after adequate imaging  [24].

Of note, this variant addresses the scenario in  which radiographs and/or noncontrast US have been performed but 
did not sufficiently characterize a soft tissue mass. In addition, this variant presumes there are no contraindications 
to any imaging modality. Variant 4 specifically addresses the situation  of a contraindication to MRI.  
CT Area  of Interest  With  IV Contrast  
Although CT with IV contrast lacks the specificity afforded by MRI in many cases, it does provide useful staging 
data [32].

Although prospective studies have  emerged  suggesting  that US is accurate  in the discrimination  of benign from

of US for the final evaluation  and staging  of a deep  soft tissue mass  is not recommended.

CT Area  of Interest  With  IV Contrast  
CT has become a useful  technique  for the evaluation  of patients  who cannot  undergo MRI and is the modality  of 
choice in this scenario  [29]. In the evaluation  of suspected  tumors,  contrast  imaging  is especially  useful  in 
distinguishing vascularized  from  potentially  necrotic regions  of the tumor.  With  modern  CT technology,  
calcification  can usually  be distinguished from  vascular  enhancement.  
Of note, d ual-energy  CT is a relatively  newer  technology that has shown  utility  in evaluation  of soft tissue masses.

US Area  of Interest  
Ultrasound  (US)  has become increasingly  recognized  as an excellent  triage  tool for evaluation  of superficial  soft 
tissue masses [12-15]. This recognition has been  further  supported by a recent  prospective  study of 219 
histologically  proven  masses that showed  US had a sensitivity, specificity, positive  predictive  value,  and negative  
predictive  value  of 93.3%,  97.9%,  45.2%,  and 99.9%,  respectively , for discriminating  benign  from  malignant  
tumors  in the superficial  soft tissues [16]. The same group  of researchers had similar  results in an earlier  separate  
retrospective analysis of 247 histologically  proven  masses [17]. However,  although these results highlight  the 
benefits of US in the initial assessment  of superficial  masses,  the overall  number  of malignancies in both the 
prospective  [16] and retrospective [17] studies was very small  (12 patients  and 11 patients,  respectively).

Radiography Area  of Interest  
Initial imaging  assessment  of a suspected  musculoskeletal  soft tissue mass  should almost  invariably  begin with 
radiographic  evaluation  and is advocated  by ESMO -EURACAN [9]. Radiographs  remain  the modality  best suited  
for the initial assessment  of a suspected  soft tissue mass  and are the initial study  of choice for orthopedic  oncologists  
[25,26] . However,  radiographs  have  limitations  and may not reveal  an abnormality  when  a mass is small, deep -

tissues of the hands  and feet [11]. 
US Area  of Interest  
The diagnostic  accuracy  of US is considerably  less when  lesions outside  the subcutaneous tissue are included.  It is 
also less reliable  for defining deep  masses in large anatomical  areas [27]. Although a recent  prospective  study of 
US accuracy  in the characterization  of 134 histologically  proven  deep  soft tissue masses showed  promising results,  
there were only a small  number  of malignancies in the study cohort , and the investigators  had a high level  of US 
expertise [28].

Radiograph y Foot  
Radiographs  are indicated  by positive  Ottawa rules with 99% sensitivity  in determining  the presence of a foot 
fracture  [1,9,10] . Radiographs  are the mainstay  of initial imaging in the setting  of acute foot trauma.  Initial  
imaging typically  consists of a 3-view study  with the possibility  of additional  views as indicated  by the clinical  
setting  [8]. Additional  views,  such as axial  calcaneal  view,  can be useful  in patients  with suspected  calcaneal  
fracture  [15] because addition of this view  increases specificity  in diagnosing calcaneal  fractures  and sensitivity  in 
distinguishing intra-articular  calcaneal  fractures.  
Lisfranc  Injury  
When  there is a fairly  high clinical  suspicion  of an acute Lisfranc injury,  the foot should be imaged.  In addition  to 
a typical  3-view  radiographic  study  of the foot (anteroposterior  [AP],  oblique,  and lateral),  an AP view with 20° 
craniocaudal  angulation can be added  [16,17] . Although patients  with Lisfra nc sprains may incur  ligamentous  
damage  without  diastasis [18], radiography  should be the initial imaging modality  in the setting  of a suspected  
Lisfranc injury.

Metatarsal -Phalangeal  Joint Injury  
The best initial imaging study  for evaluating  hallux  plantar  plate  disruption  after metatarsal -phalangeal  (MTP)  
joint injury  is weightbearing  AP, lateral,  and sesamoid  axial  views,  with addition  of comparison  radiographs  of 
the contralateral  foot [29].  Radiographs  may also indirectly  evaluate lesser  metatarsophalangeal  plantar  plate  
injury  [30]. The combination  of a positive  drawer  test coupled with transverse deviation  of the third  MTP  joint on 
radiographs  can be used to diagnose  high-grade  plantar  plate  tear of the second  MTP joint [31]. 
A forced  dorsiflexion lateral  view of the hallux  MTP  joint is recommended  if there is clinical  suspicion  of plantar  
plate  injury  of the first MTP joint [29]. 
Radiography Foot  with  Weightbearing  
The best initial imaging study  for evaluating  hallux  plantar  plate  disruption after MTP joint injury  is 
weightbearing  AP, lateral,  and sesamoid  axial  views  with addition  of comparison radiographs  of the contralateral  
foot [29,32] . 
CT Foot  
Studies  report  moderate to poor sensitivity  (25%–33%)  of radiographs  in detection  of midfoot  fractures [21] in 
Level  1 trauma  patients.  A study of 49 patients  with acute hyperflexion injuries  to the foot concluded that 
conventional  radiographs  including  weightbearing  images are not sufficient  for routine  diagnostic  workup and CT 
should serve as the primary  imaging  technique  for such patients  [33]. 
MRI Foot  
MRI is the most  sensitive modality  for the detection  of occult  fracture  and acute bone  stress changes [34,35] .

are negative,  MRI can be obtained in select  patients  with forefoot  pain because of its increased  sensitivity  for the 
early  detection  of metatarsal  head  subchondral  fracture  [54]. 
Lisfranc  Injury  
MRI has been  advocated  as a sensitive diagnostic  test in evaluation  of Lisfranc ligamentous  complex  (especially  
if the patient  is not able to bear weight),  and 3-D volumetric  acquisitions  have  proven superiority  over orthogonal  
proton  density  fat-suppressed  imaging [33,38,41- 45]. There is a high correlation  between  MRI and intraoperative  
findings  for an unstable  Lisfranc injury  [44]. In the patient  with a suspected  Lisfranc injury  and normal  
radiographs,  the literature  supports  further advanced  imaging  by MRI  and CT [21,33,43,46] . 
Turf Toe and Plantar  Plate Injuries 
MRI is the preferred  imaging method for evaluating  suspected  “turf  toe” and lesser  metatarsal  plantar  plate  injury  
by directly  evaluating  the soft-tissue structures of the capsuloligamentous  complex  as well as assessing  chondral

Acute  Tendinous  Rupture  
MRI tends  to be used as a screening  tool when  one is not certain  of the specific tendon injury  or if concomitant  
osseous injury  is suspected.  Both  MRI and US have  been  shown  to be sensitive  for the diagnosis  of acute tendon  
rupture  or dislocation  in the foot [39].

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Acute injuries  to the foot are frequently  encountered  in the setting  of the emergency  room  and in general  practice.  
The clinical  indications  for imaging  (known as the Ottawa rules)  have  been  developed  to minimize  unnecessary  
radiographs , and their utility  is well documented by multiple  studies.  The most  commonly  accepted  form  of these  
rules is the following:  
A series of foot radiographs  is required  only if there  is pain in the midfoot  and any one of the 
following:  1) point  bone  tenderness of the navicular;  2) point  bone  tenderness of the base of the fifth 
metatarsal;  or 3) inability  to bear weight  or to walk  4 steps (immediately  after the injury  or at the 
emergency  department) .

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 9 Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture  [8]. Detection of osseous change is more limited in areas covered by prominent overlapping soft tissue [17]. If the 
osseous reaction involve s cortical bone, then endosteal/periosteal callus may be visible with or without a fracture 
line through the cortex. If the trabecular bone is involved, then stress fractures are often more  subtle, progressing 
from patchy areas of increased density into linear areas of sclerosis, oriented perpendicular to the trabeculae.  
Although bone scans were regarded as the gold-standard examination for many years, MRI is extremely sensitive 
and demonstrates stress abnormalities as early as bone scintigraphy  and with as much sensitivity  [11-14] . The 
recent literature favors MRI as the procedure of choice for making an early diagnosis of both varieties of stress 
fractures [15-28]. In this regard, MRI outperforms radiography,  bone scintigraphy, and CT. Furthermore, MRI 
examination of an osseous stress injury contains  prognostic as well as diagnostic information  [30,31]. 
CT is not typically used as a first - or second -line imaging tool  but may offer an adjunctive role when other 
imaging modalities are equivocal  [23]. Although  superior to radiography, it is less sensitive than nuclear 
scintigraphy and MRI  [19]. 
Stress fractures in the femur most often occur in the femoral neck and represent up to 7% of all stress fractures  
[39]. Lateral “tension -type ” femoral neck stress fractures are inherently unstable and prone to displacement  [40] 
and are high-risk fractures, often necessitating percutaneous screw fixation  [41]. Medial “compression -type ” 
femoral n eck stress fractures are low risk [40] and can be treated with a non– weight -bearing  regimen  [42].

Page Content: Furthermore, MRI may als o demonstrate other reasons for occult pelvic pain, such as soft -tissue abnormalities or 
the subchondral hip or supra -acetabular stress fractures described in some osteoporotic patients [63]. The clinical 
differential diagnosis includes sacroiliitis from inflammatory or infectious causes, osteitis condensans ilii, and 
lumbosacral degenerative spondylosis  [60]. 
Variant 12: Suspect stress (fatigue or insufficiency) fracture of the long bones . Pregn ant patient. 
See variant 11. In the case of long bones, the fetus’ absorbed dose from radiography and CT will be substantially 
lower. Women can be reassured that benefit far outweighs the risk wi th regard to diagnostic imaging, as all 
radiographs and CT sc ans not involving the abdomen or pelvis hav e a predicted fetal absorbed dose of less than 1 
mGy  [80]. Radiographs should be the initial imaging evaluation because findings may be conclusive , in which 
case no further imaging should be performed. MRI does not use ionizing radiation and can  be used  as necessary to 
make the diagnosis.  
Summary of Recommendations  
• In the setting of a suspected fatigue fracture, the initial imaging test should be radiography of the area of 
interest, although it is not a sensitive examination. 
• If there is clinical concern  for a fatigue fracture of the hip and initial radiographs are negative, MRI without 
contrast should be performed because of the high risk of complications.  
• In the setting of a suspected fatigue fracture in a location other than the hip with initial negati ve radiographs, 
either repeat radiographs in 10  to 14 days or MRI without contrast may be appropriate depending on the 
location of pain and relative risk of complications secondary to stress fractures in that area.  
• If there is an immediate need -to-know sit uation to diagnose a stress fracture in the setting of negative 
radiographs, for example,  professional football player, then MRI w ithout contrast is recommended.

Page Content: Furthermore, certain athletic activities often result in specific sites of fatigue  fracture, such as olecranon process 
fractures in javelin throwers and baseball pitchers, proximal femur and tibial stress fractures in runners, and  tarsal  
navicular stress fractures in basketball players [ 36-38] . Correlat ion of  clinical history, pattern , and site recognition 
with radiographic findings  is usually specific [1,2,4,5,7]. Nevertheless, stress fractures are frequently occult on 
initial radiographs  [1], with conventional radiographs having a sensitivity of 15% to 35% [8]. Early radiographic 
findings are often nonspecific (subtle periosteal reaction , gray cortex sign) or even nonexistent. Late radiographic 
findings are often suggestive in appearance  and include  linear sclerosis (often perpe ndicular to the major 
trabecular lines), periosteal reaction , patchy endosteal sclerosis, and soft -tissue swelling . Additionally, 
radiographs may remain negative depending on the timing of re imaging , the patient’s metabolic bone status, and 
the type and lo cation of the fracture. Thus, radiographs are specific but significantly insensitive. Despite this 
limitation, all authorities agree that radiographs should be the initial imaging modality; if the findings are 
conclusive, no further imaging need be perform ed. 
Variant 2: S uspected stress (fatigue) fracture, hip. Negative radiographs. Next imaging study.   
Short -term (10  to 14 days) follow -up radiographs are more sensitive than initial radiographs secondary to overt 
bone reaction in the location of the stress fracture. Follow -up radiographic sensitivity increases to 30 % to 70%

Page Content: Finally, stress fractures of the femoral head are high  risk in healthy patients and , if not recognized promptly, have 
increased  rates of delayed union, nonunion, displacement, and avascular necrosis [17]. Given the importance of 
recognizing these high-risk fractures in the femoral head and neck, MRI is the preferred second -line study after  
initial negative  radiographs to prevent delayed diagnosis.  
Variant 3: Suspected stress (fatigue) fracture, excluding hip  and vertebrae. Negative radiographs. Next 
imaging study.  
See variant 2. Certain stress fractures are considered high  risk based on a tendency for nonunion or delayed union. 
High -risk stress fractures include the anterior tibial diaphysis, lateral femoral neck and femoral head (see variant 
2), patella, medial malleolus, navicular, fifth metatarsal base, proximal second metatarsal, tibial hallux sesamoid, 
and talus  [43]. 
The second -line test to diagnose a stress fracture should be guided by the location of the patient ’s pain and 
likelihood of high-risk injury. A follow -up radiographic examination has increased sensitivity compared to initial 
radiographs [8] but is less sensitive than MRI. MRI is extremely sensitive and demonstrates stress abnormalities 
as early as bone scintigraphy and with as much sensitivity [ 11-14]. The recent literature favors MRI as the 
procedure of choice for making an early diagnosis of both varieties of stress fractures [ 15-28 ]. MRI is also 
considerably more specifi c than bone scintigraphy [ 19,23]. Stress injuries in athletes that are not identified and 
managed in a timel y fashion can progress to more serious fractures. Preventive strategies, including identifying 
and modifying risk factors, may help deter progression to frank fractures [31,44,45]. 
A circumstance that deserves specific attention is the longitudinal stress fracture, particularly in the tibia. Up to 
25% may appear n ormal on radiographs, but CT or MRI findings are characteristic [ 13,46].

to-play” evaluation . 
See variants 1  through  3. On initial diagnosis, MRI can be used to  predict t ime to return to play in athletes. 
Fredericson et al  [48] retrospectively correlated return to activity with an MRI grading system based on the 
pattern of periosteal and marrow edema on T1-weighted  and fat -suppressed T 2-weighted sequences. Similar 
findings were confirmed in other studies  [49-51] , including  that the finding of abnormal cortical signal intensity 
or a fracture line was of prognostic value [ 51] and that MRI performed better in predicting return to activity than 
radiographs , bone scintigraphy, or CT [50,52]. 
A recent prospective study in university athletes found that MRI grading s everity, total-body bone mineral density 
evaluated by dual -energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and location of injury (ie , cortical or trabecular bone)  
were important variables for predicting time to full return to sport [ 31]. In this study, periosteal edema as 
described by Fredericson et al [ 48] was not associated with return to sport . Using the modified grading scale and a 
multiple regression model, for every 1- unit increase in MRI grade, the time to full return to sport increased by 
approximately 48 days [31] . Furthermore, trabecular st ress injuries (eg , femur neck and pubic bone ) were 
associated with a longer time to return to sport than cortical bone stress injuries. In addition, decreased bone 
mineral density leads to increased time to return to sport . Therefore, bone mineral density provides additional 
diagnostic and prognostic information [31]. The model of MRI  grade, trabecular versus cortical bone sit e, and 
total-body bone mineral density a ccounted for 68% of the variation in time to return to sport [ 31].",True

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
The Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention  National  Diabetes Statistics  Report  of 2017 states that 30.3 
million  people  in the United  States  have  diabetes (9.4%  of the population)  [1]. Diabetes-related  foot 
complications , such as soft-tissue infection, osteomyelitis , and neuropathic  osteoarthropathy,  account  for up to 
20% of all diabetic -related  North  American  hospital  admissions,  with up to $1.5 billion  spent  annually in the 
United  States  on diabetic  foot ulcer  care [2]. 
Neuropathic  changes in the foot are present  in about  1% of diabetics [3]. Neuropathic  osteoarthropathy  is a 
progressive  process affecting  the bones,  joints , and soft tissue of the foot and ankle.  Delay  in the diagnosis  may 
lead to derangement  of the bony architecture of the foot, deformity,  recurrent  foot ulcerations,  cellulitis,  
osteomyelitis , and amputation [4]. 
Imaging findings  should not be interpreted  in isolation.

Page Content: Furthermore, MRI has been found to have low (64% to 77%) specificity in identifying clinically significant 
interspinous ligament, intervertebral disc, and paraspinal muscle injury [62]. 
While not limited to obtunded patients, recent prospectiv e multicenter trials suggest that MRI has a role in 
evaluating patients who have a negative cervical spine CT. The Western Trauma Association Multi-Institutional 
trial reported that CT was effective for ruling out clinically  significant injury with a sensitivity of 98.5%. A small 
but clinically significant incidence of a missed injury was noted [56]. The prospective ReCONECT trial studied 
767 patients who had a negative cervical spine CT and we nt on to MRI because of cervicalgia (43.0%), inability 
to evaluate (44.1%), or both (9.4%). MRI was abnormal in 23.6% of all patients, including ligamentous injury 
(16.6%), soft-tissue swelling (4.3%), vertebral disc injury  (1.4%), and dural hematomas (1.3%). The patients with 
abnormal MRI were less likely to have their cervical colla r removed than those with normal MRI (13.3% versus 
88.1%). Eleven patients underwent cervical spine surgery af ter the MRI results. The clin ical significance of these 
abnormal MRI findings could not be determined from this study group [55]. By inference, it is likely that some 
obtunded patients with negative cervical spine CT will have abnormal MRI, and some of these MRI-detected 
injuries may require treatment.

Summary of Literature Review 
Introduction/Background 
Cervical Spine Imaging An estimated 3% to 4% of patients presenting to the emer gency department with blunt trauma have sustained an 
injury to the cervical spine [1,2]. Cervical spine injuries can range from stable minor soft-tissue injuries to 
unstable complex injury patterns resulting in complete disr uption of the cervical spine with possible neurologic or 
vascular injury. The wide spectrum of injury patterns can make the decision process for when to perform imaging 
and what type of imaging to perform challenging. Over utilization of MRI and CT imaging of the cervical spine 
can result in an extended emergency center visit while aw aiting imaging as well as iatrogenic injuries related to 
prolonged cervical collar placement [3], exposure to in travenous (IV) contrast, and exposure to radiation and 
high-power magnetic fields. On the other hand, failure to  identify an unstable cervical spine or cervical vascular 
injury can result in poor clinical outcomes.

Injury [5] 
 Simple rear-end motor vehicle crash 
 Patient in sitting position in emergency center 
 Patient ambulatory at any time after trauma 
 Delayed onset of neck pain 
 Absence of midline cervical spine tenderness 
Thoracic and Lumbar Spine Imaging 
Injuries to the thoracolumbar spine are even more prevalent than cervical spin e injury, with an estimated 4% to 
7% of patients presenting to the emergency department  with blunt trauma sustaining a fracture of the 
thoracolumbar spine [13,14]. An increasing rate of t horacolumbar spine fractures h as been seen in the United 
States over the past several decades, despite a decline in other motor vehicle–related injuries [15]. While the exact 
reason for this increase is uncertain, it is likely due to a combination of both increased detection of thoracolumbar 
spine injury and increased rate of seatbelt injury. Similar to cervical in juries, there is a wide spectrum of 
thoracolumbar spine injuries ranging from stable, minor soft -tissue injuries to unstable fracture dislocations that 
are often accompanied by neurologic injuries. In contrast  to the cervical spine, there are no widely used and 
validated criteria to help determine if th oracolumbar spine imaging is appropriate. 
Clinical examination has a low to very low sensitivit y for identifying thoracolumbar spine injuries [16-18]. 
Therefore, a low threshold should be maintained for screen ing the thoracolumbar spine with imaging in the setting 
of blunt trauma, particularly in older patients, who are at increased risk for spine fractures occurring in the setting 
of low-energy trauma, such as a fall from standing (ie,  fragility fractures), which are due to diminished bone 
mineralization commonly present in older patient populations . A low threshold for imaging of the thoracolumbar

Cervical spine CT is the preferred modality for the initia l assessment of cervical spine injury. However, CT is 
significantly inferior to MRI in identifying many soft-tissu e pathologies, such as spinal cord contusion, epidural 
hematoma, and nerve root avulsions, that can cause neur ologic deficits and require surgical intervention 
[40,41,43,57]. Therefore, CT should not be considered ad equate for excluding significant soft-tissue pathology in 
patients presenting with signs or symptoms of cervical spinal cord or  nerve root injury.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 7 Suspected Spine Trauma spine should also be maintained for patients with di sease processes known to cause spin e rigidity, such as diffuse 
idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis or ankylosing spondylitis. 
A comprehensive literature review of thoracolumbar trau ma was performed by Hsu et al [19] in 2003 with the 
conclusion that patients should undergo im aging of the thoracolumbar spine if  the following criteria were present: 
(1) back pain or midline tenderness, (2) local signs of thoracolumbar injury, (3) abnormal neurological signs, (4) 
cervical spine fracture, (5) Glasgow Coma  Scale score (GCS) <15, (6) major distracting injury, or (7) alcohol or 
drug intoxication. A prospective study by Holmes et al [20] of 152 patients with thoracolumbar spine injury in 2003 found 100% negative predictive value for thoracolumbar spine injury in patients not meeting any of the 
following criteria: (1) complaints of thoracolumbar spine pain, (2) thoracolumb ar spine tenderness, (3) a 
decreased level of consciousness, (4) intoxication with etha nol or drugs, (5) a neurologic deficit, or (6) a painful 
distracting injury. A prospective study of over 3,000 adult blunt trauma patients performed by Inaba et al [21] in 
2015 found 98.9% sensitivity for identifying patients with clin ically significant thoracolumbar spine injury using 
the following criteria: (1) positive physical examination (i ncluding neurologic deficit), (2) high-risk mechanism of 
injury, and (3) ≥60 years of age. It should be noted that in the study by Inaba et al, patients with altered 
consciousness (GCS <15), intoxication, or painful distrac ting injury were excluded from analysis because of their 
inability to perform an adequate examination necessitating imaging clear ance of the thoracolumbar spine. 
However, none of these 3 proposed criteria have  been validated independently (Table 4).

Variant 9: Age greater than or equal to 16 years. Blunt trauma meeting criteria for thoracic and lumbar 
imaging. Initial imaging. 
Imaging is a crucial component in assessment of thoracic and lumbar spine injury. Fr om 1998 to 2011, there was 
an adjusted annual increase of approximately 8% in thor acolumbar spine fractures in patients involved in motor 
vehicle collisions [15]. Thoracolumbar fractures are cha llenging to identify clinically, with only 48% to 75% of 
thoracolumbar injuries identified on clinical examination [16-18]. Unlike cervical injuries, well-defined clinical 
criteria have not been established to determine when thor acolumbar imaging is appropriate in the setting of blunt 
traumatic injury. Since clinical examination has poor sen sitivity for identifying thoracolumbar injuries, any high-
risk patient (mid line thoracolumbar tenderness, high-energ y mechanism of injury, or >60 years of age), as well as 
unexaminable patients (intoxicated, GCS <15, distracting injury), should undergo imaging of the thoracolumbar 
spine. Screening of the entire spine is advised, as an es timated 20% of spine injuries will have a second associated 
spinal injury at a noncontiguous level [26,27]. 
Radiography  Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
It is well established that CT outperforms radiographs in  the diagnosis of thoracolumbar spine fractures [104-
108]. Radiographs have a reported sens itivity of 49% to 62% for identifying thoracic spine fractures and 67% to 
82% sensitivity for identifying lumbar spine fractures [ 104,107,108] compared with the reported sensitivity of 
94% to 100% for identifying thoracolumbar spine fract ures using CT [104,107,108].

CT Myelography Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
CT myelography can be performed to assess for traumatic spinal canal narrowing that is due to disc herniation or 
epidural hematoma and to assess for preganglionic nerve root avulsions. Ho wever, as with conventional CT, CT 
myelography is inferior to MRI in assessing cord contus ion, cord hemorrhage, and postganglionic nerve root 
injuries [40,41,43,57]. Performance of thoracolumbar CT myelogram can also be technically challenging, 
particularly in patients with suspected  unstable thoracolumbar spine injury. 
CT Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
CT does play a role in the initial assessment of thoracic and lumbar spine injury. However, CT is significantly 
inferior to MRI in identifying many soft-tissue pathologies,  such as cord contusion, epidural hematoma, and nerve 
root avulsions that can cause neurologic deficits re quiring surgical intervention [40,41,43,57]. Therefore, CT 
should not be considered adequate for excluding signifi cant soft-tissue pathology in patients presenting with 
thoracolumbar spine trauma and neurologic deficit. 
MRI Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
MRI should be performed in patients who have possible spinal  cord injury, in whom there is clinical concern for 
cord compression that is due to disc protrusion or hema toma, and in those suspected of ligamentous instability. 
MRI is valuable for characterizing the cause of myelopathy in  patients with spinal cord  injury. The severity of the 
injury—including extent of intramedullary hemorrhage , length of edema, and evidence of cord transection—
contributes to predicting outcome.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 13 Low Back  Pain MRI Lumbar Spine Without and With IV Contrast  
Although MRI  lumbar  spine  without  IV contrast  is the preferred  initial study,  MRI lumbar  spine  without  and with 
IV contrast  may be helpful  to delineate  etiology  of CES when  clinical  suspicion  of underlying malignancy,  
infection, or inflammation  (see Variant  7). 
MRI Lumbar Spine Without IV Contrast  
MRI lumbar  spine  without  IV contrast  is most  useful  in the evaluation  of suspected  CES, multifocal deficit, or 
progressive  neurologic  deficit  because of its ability  to accurately  depict  soft-tissue pathology,  assess vertebral  
marrow,  and assess the spinal  canal  patency.  A prospective  cohort  study by Bell et al [41] recommends urgent  MRI  
assessment  in all patients  who present  with new-onset  urinary  symptoms  in the context  of LBP or sciatica.  Recently, 
a single  3-D heavily  T2-weighted  fat-saturated  sequence protocol  has been  shown  to be a rapid,  highly sensitive 
tool for evaluating  CES in the emergency  department  that can be utilized  for improved efficiency  and emergency  
department  throughput  [42]. 
Radiography Lumbar  Spine  
There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of radiography in the initial imaging  of suspected  CES. 
Variant  5: Low  back  pain  with  history  of prior  lumbar  surgery  and with  or without  radiculopathy. New or 
progressing  symptoms  or clinical findings . Initial imaging.  
There are many  causes of back  pain following  surgery.  Some  of the more  frequent  etiologies  diagnosed  with 
imaging  include  free disc or bone  fragments,  postoperative  scarring,  failure  of bone  graft  for fusion,  and recurrent  
disc protrusion.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 11 Low Back  Pain Discography  and Post-Discography  CT Lumbar  Spine  
Although the utility  of discography in patients  with LBP remains  controversial,  a systematic review by Manchikanti  
et al [32] provides  level  III evidence that lumbar  discography may be useful  in patients  with chronic  discogenic  
LBP. 
FDG -PET/CT  Whole  Body  
There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of whole -body FDG-PET/CT in the evaluation  of a surgery  or 
intervention  candidate with persistent  or progressive  symptoms  during  or following 6 weeks of conservative  
management  [28-30]. 
MRI Lumbar Spine With IV Contrast  
MRI lumbar  spine  with IV contrast  is not typically  performed  independently as an initial study,  as its interpretation  
is most  informative  when  correlated  with standard  noncontrast  sequences included in MRI lumbar  spine  with and 
without  IV contrast  [33]. 
MRI Lumbar Spine Without and With IV Contrast  
MRI with IV contrast  is typically  not necessary  in the evaluation  of a surgical  or interventional candidate with 
persistent  or progressive  symptoms  during or following  6 weeks of conservative management  but is sometimes  
useful  if noncontrast  MRI is nondiagnostic  or indeterminate.  Contrast  can help distinguish  residual/recurrent  disc 
from  fibrosis/scar  in a postoperative  patient  (see Variant  5). 
MRI Lumbar Spine Without IV Contrast  
Patients  presenting  with subacute or chronic  LBP or radiculopathy  who have  failed  6 weeks of conservative therapy , 
and with physical  examination  signs  of nerve  root irritation , should  be imaged  if they are believed  to be candidates 
for surgery  or intervention  or if diagnostic  uncertainty  remains.  Accurate diagnosis  of disc disease can be provided  
by MRI [7].

Page Content: In line with the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations for patients  
ages 65 and older being screened for osteoporosis, patients  >65 years of age may be considered at risk for 
osteoporotic fracture when presenting with LBP . 
Additionally,  for those  patients without  neurologic  compromise  and who present  with minor  risk factors for cancer,  
inflammatory  back  disease  (eg, ankylosing spondylitis), vertebral  compression  fracture,  or symptomatic  spinal  
stenosis,  imaging  should be considered  after a trial of therapy  [4]. 
In the majority  of patients, no specific pathology for LBP can be identified. Also,  studies have  shown  imaging  
abnormalities  in a substantial  number  of people  without back  pain [11-13]. The challenge for the clinician, therefore,  
is to distin guish the small  segment  within  this large patient  population that should be evaluated  further because of 
suspicion  of a more  serious  problem  or identify  pathology that requires intervention . 
Other  nonspine  causes of LBP can have overlap  in clinical  presentation,  including inflammatory  arthritis  and other  
systemic conditions , such as pelvic,  renal,  vascular,  or gastrointestinal  etiologies.  If an inflammatory  etiology  is 
suspected  as the cause of LBP, such as ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic  spondylitis, reactive arthritis, or 
inflammatory  bowel  disease– related  spine  disorders,  please see the ACR  Appropriateness Criteria® topic  on 
“Inflammatory Back Pain: Known or Suspected Axial Spondyloarthropathy ” [14].

routine  imaging  in patients  with nonspecific  LBP. Duration  of symptoms  also helps  guide  treatment  algorithms  in

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
In the United  States,  acute low back  pain (LBP),  with or without radiculopathy , is the leading  cause of years lived  
with disability  and the third  ranking cause of disability -adjusted  life years  [1]. It is the fifth most  common  reason  
for a physician  visit in the United  States  and accounts for approximately  3% of visits  to the emergency  department  
[2]. 
The American  College  of Physicians and the American  Pain Society  classify  LBP into the following  broad  
categories:  nonspecific LBP, back  pain potentially  associated  with radiculopathy or spinal  stenosis,  and back  pain 
potentially  associated  with another  specific spinal  cause [3].",True

   - Age: 46 years old
   - Symptoms: Acute onset of worsening numbness and tingling in all 4 limbs, uncoordinated movements, difficulty controlling continence, reduced pinprick sensation in bilateral hands and feet, reduced power in all 4 limbs, potentially lax anal tone. These symptoms suggest a possible myelopathy.
   - Previous diagnosis: Systemic lupus erythematosus
   - Stage of diagnosis: Initial imaging, as there is no prior imaging.

2. According to the reference information, for acute onset myelopathy, an MRI of the spine area of interest without and with IV contrast is usually appropriate. This is because MRI has superior soft-tissue resolution and multiplanar capability, making it ideal for evaluation of the spinal canal and its contents as well as the surrounding osseous and soft-tissue structures. Inflammatory conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus can result in acute myelopathy.

3. There are no superior imaging procedures or treatments with a more favorable risk-benefit ratio mentioned in the context.

Page Content: Although infrequent,  spinal  cord ischemia can result  in acute onset  myelopathy and in adults  is most  commonly  the 
result  of atheromatous  disease  or as a complication  of aortic  surgery  [3]. Other  pathologies  that may predispose  
patients  to developing spinal  cord ischemia include  systemic hypotension,  thoracoabdominal  aneurysms or 
dissection , sickle cell disease,  and spinal  arteriovenous  malformations  (AVM s) [27,28] . Very  rarely,  patients  may 
develop hematomyelia and subsequently acute myelopathy because of an intrameduallary  AVM  or spinal  artery  
aneurysm  rupture  [29,30] . Acute ischemic myelopathy can also develop in the setting  of fibrocartilaginous  embolic  
disease [31]. Depending on the level(s)  of the spinal  cord involved,  patients  will typically  develop acute paraparesis 
or quadriparesis.  Inflammatory  conditions  that can result  in acute myelopathy include  demyelinating  diseases such 
as multiple  sclerosis (MS),  neuromyelitis  optica  (NMO),  and acute disseminated  encephalomyelitis (ADEM) ; 
systemic inflammatory  conditions  such as systemic lupus  erythematous,  Sjogren  syndrome,  mixed  connective  tissue  
disorder,  Behcet  disease,  and sarcoidosis;  and infectious  diseases [8]. 
MRI Spine 
MRI is useful  for evaluation  of the spinal  cord when  investigating  the etiology  of acute myelopathy [32]. MRI  has 
superior  soft-tissue resolution  and multiplanar  capability , making  it ideal  for evaluation  of the spinal  canal  and its 
contents  as well as the surrounding osseous and soft-tissue structures [13-15,33-36] .

Page Content: MS is the classic demyelinating 
disease and is characterized  by lesions affecting  the spinal  cord (and brain)  and clinical  defects disseminated  in 
space and time [61]. Spinal cord involvement  is seen in 80% to 90% of patients  with MS, most  commonly affecting  
the cervical  cord [62]. Patients  with primary  progressive  MS tend to have  more  spinal  cord involvement  than 
patients  with relapsing -remitting  MS [12]. When myelopathy due to MS is suspected,  MRI detection  of spinal  cord 
lesion(s)  fulfills  part of the 2016 Magnetic Resonance Imaging in MS (MAGNIMS ) criteria  [63]. NMO  is a 
demyelinating  condition characterized  by optic  neuritis  and spinal  cord lesions.  Brain  lesions are not as commonly  
encountered  in NMO as in MS, so, when  present , tend to predominate  in regions  around the third  and fourth  
ventricles [64-66]. ADEM  is a demyelinating  condition that typically  manifests as encephalopathy.  Spinal  cord 
involvement  is present  in approximately 25% of cases of ADEM . MRI of the spine  is generally  considered  the 
reference standard  for imaging  of the spinal  cord in cases of suspected  demyelinating  disease [63,67,68]  in addition  
to excluding alternative  etiologies.  Contrast -enhanced  imaging  is recommended  for initial diagnostic  evaluation  
[69,70] . 
MRA Spine 
There is no relevant  literature  regarding the use of MR angiography (MRA ) in the initial imaging  evaluation  of 
acute onset  myelopathy.  In cases of spinal  cord ischemia,  MRA  can be used to identify  the artery  of Adamkiewicz  
or vertebral  artery  dissection/occlusion  and should  be considered  as a follow -up to MRI [12].

lesion(s)  fulfills  part of the 2016  MAGNIMS  criteria  [63]. Other  demyelinating  processes such as NMO and ADEM  
can present  as chronic  myelopathy less commonly.  In patients  with chronic  or progressive myelopathy,  MRI  of the 
spinal  cord can identify  spinal  cord lesions suggestive  of demyelinating  disease in addition  to excluding  alternative  
etiologie s. Contrast -enhanced  imaging  is recommended  for initial diagnostic  evaluation  [69,70] . 
Metabolic  causes of chronic  or progressive  myelopathy result  in changes in the spinal  cord known  as subacute 
combined degeneration  and are best evaluated  with MRI [11,83,84] . Chronic  infections  can have  a similar  
appearance [12].  
Radiation -induced  myelopathy is a rare dose-dependent  complication  that anatomically  localizes to a prior  radiation  
port [85]. Autoimmune  myelitis  includes  paraneoplastic myelopathy [86,87] . MRI  without  and with IV contrast  is 
useful  to evaluate the spinal  cord in these instances.  
Vascular  malformations  can likewise present  with chronic  and slowly  progressive  myelopathy [88]. MRI without  
and with IV contrast  is useful  to demonstrate spinal  cord edema  caused  by venous  hypertension and enlarged  veins  
along the dorsal  surface of the spinal  cord.  There may be patchy  intramedullary  enhancement  due to breakdown  of 
the blood-cord  barrier.  In some  cases,  abnormal  vasculature may be identified  that may be useful  to guide  spinal  
arteriography  and intervention [5,89-91] .

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 13 Low Back  Pain MRI Lumbar Spine Without and With IV Contrast  
Although MRI  lumbar  spine  without  IV contrast  is the preferred  initial study,  MRI lumbar  spine  without  and with 
IV contrast  may be helpful  to delineate  etiology  of CES when  clinical  suspicion  of underlying malignancy,  
infection, or inflammation  (see Variant  7). 
MRI Lumbar Spine Without IV Contrast  
MRI lumbar  spine  without  IV contrast  is most  useful  in the evaluation  of suspected  CES, multifocal deficit, or 
progressive  neurologic  deficit  because of its ability  to accurately  depict  soft-tissue pathology,  assess vertebral  
marrow,  and assess the spinal  canal  patency.  A prospective  cohort  study by Bell et al [41] recommends urgent  MRI  
assessment  in all patients  who present  with new-onset  urinary  symptoms  in the context  of LBP or sciatica.  Recently, 
a single  3-D heavily  T2-weighted  fat-saturated  sequence protocol  has been  shown  to be a rapid,  highly sensitive 
tool for evaluating  CES in the emergency  department  that can be utilized  for improved efficiency  and emergency  
department  throughput  [42]. 
Radiography Lumbar  Spine  
There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of radiography in the initial imaging  of suspected  CES. 
Variant  5: Low  back  pain  with  history  of prior  lumbar  surgery  and with  or without  radiculopathy. New or 
progressing  symptoms  or clinical findings . Initial imaging.  
There are many  causes of back  pain following  surgery.  Some  of the more  frequent  etiologies  diagnosed  with 
imaging  include  free disc or bone  fragments,  postoperative  scarring,  failure  of bone  graft  for fusion,  and recurrent  
disc protrusion.

Page Content: Accurate diagnosis  of disc disease can be provided  
by MRI [7]. 
Although disc abnormalities are common on MRI in asymptomatic  patients,  LBP with radiculopathy or clinical  
signs  of spinal  stenosis suggests the presence of demonstrable  nerve  root compression  on MRI  [13]. In a study of 
symptomatic  patients,  there  was a higher  prevalence  of herniation . Fifty -seven  percent  of patients with LBP  and 
65% of patients  with radiculopathy  had disc herniation  as compared  with the 20% to 28% prevalence reported  in 
the asymptomatic series [7]. Interestingly, the size and type of disc herniation  and location  and presence of nerve  
root compression  were not related  to patient  outcome  [7,34] . 
Kobayashi  et al [35] have  shown  the utility  of MRI in diagnosing active spondylolysis  in radiographically occult  
spondylolysis.  
Radiography Lumbar  Spine  
Although  radiography  alone  is not sufficient  for guidance  on surgical  or interventional  options  without  MRI  and/or  
CT imaging,  it can be seen as compl ementary.  Upright  radiographs  provide  useful  functional  information  about  
axial  loading  [36]. The ability  to incorporate  flexion  and extension  radiographs  is essential  to identify  segmental  
motion,  which  is important in the surgical  management  of spondylolisthesis  [24,37] . Lateral  bending images have  
been  shown  to be helpful  in spinal  deformity  correction  surgery  [25].

Page Content: Additionally,  guidelines  from  the American  College

reassurance,  initial pain management  medications if necessary,  and consideration  of physical  therapies without  
routine  imaging  in patients  with nonspecific  LBP. Duration  of symptoms  also helps  guide  treatment  algorithms  in 
patients  with acute,  subacute,  or chronic  LBP. Additionally, assessment  of psychosocial  risk factors when  obtaining  
patient  history  is a strong predictor  of patients  who are predisposed  to developing chronic  disabling LBP problems

Although there  is great  variability  in the definition  of acute and subacute  LBP, for the purposes  of this guideline,  
we will use the Institute  for Clinical Systems  Improvement  definitions  of 0 to 4 weeks to define  acute LBP,  4 to 12 
weeks for subacute LBP, and >12 weeks for chronic  LBP [5]. 
It is clear  that uncomplicated  acute  LBP and/or  radiculopathy is a benign,  self-limited  condition  that does not

for those  patients  presenting  with red flags , raising  suspicion  for a serious underlying  condition,  such as cauda

MRI is the most sensitive test for detecting soft  abnormalities asso ciated with neck pain; however, this is 
characterized by a high rate of abnormalities in asymptomatic individuals [22 ,23]. As such, MRI is not considered 
a first -line imaging modality in the setting of acute or worsening uncompl icated neck pain.

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
The physical,  psychological , and socioeconomic  impact  of cervical  or neck  pain is extensive.  In 2010,  16.3 
million  health  care visits  to hospitals  and physician  offices were related  primarily  to neck  pain [1]. The Global  
Burden  of Disease 2010 Study  identified  neck  pain as the fourth  leading  cause of years lost to disability [2], with 
most  epidemiological  studies reporting an annual  prevalence ranging between  15% and 50% [3-8]. Although  most  
episodes resolve,  nearly  50% of individuals  continue  to experience ongoing or recurrent  pain [9].

Page Content: Radiculopathies  may result  from  compressive causes  related to narrowing of the neural foramina, such as by facet 
or uncovertebral joint hypertrophy, or from associated dis c bulging or herniation  and degenerative spondylosis  in 
the absence of a history  of diabetes or red flag symptom s [31].  A recent meta-analysis assessing the positive 
predictive value of physical examination tests in the setting of a clinical history of cervical radiculopathy 
concluded there was limited evidence for a correlation between physical examination findings and MRI evidence 
of cervical nerve root compression [32].  This may be due to a high rate of both false -positive and false-negative 
findings on MRI in the setting of suspected cervical radiculopathy [33 ]. Most cases of acute cervical neck pain 
with radicular symptoms resolve spontaneously or with conse rvative treatment measures [31, 34]. 
In absence of red flag symptoms, imaging may not be required at time of initial presentation [1 ] as spondylotic 
changes are commonly identified on radi ographs and MRI in patients >30 years of age and correlate poorly with 
the presence of neck pain [20-23]. Although the diagnostic accuracy of red flag symptoms is not validated for the 
cervical spine, the Bone  and Joint  Decade 2000 -2010 Task Force on Neck Pain and Its Associated Disorders [1] 
recommended the adoption of a similar system for cervical and neck pain, with red flags that include  trauma, 
malignancy, prior neck surgery, spinal cord injury, systemic diseases —inclu ding ankylosing spondylitis, diffuse 
idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, inflammatory arthritis, suspected infection —history of intravenous drug use,

   - Symptoms: Left wrist swelling and redness for 1 week, no trauma, no fever, wrist is warm, swollen, and tender

2. According to the reference information, the best initial study for chronic wrist pain with or without prior injury is radiography. However, in this case, the patient presents with symptoms suggestive of possible septic arthritis (swelling, redness, warmth, and tenderness of the wrist). 

3. For suspected septic arthritis, the reference information suggests that joint aspiration is usually appropriate. This procedure can help confirm the diagnosis by analyzing the aspirate for cell count, gram stain, and appropriate cultures. If the joint is distended, aspiration can be performed without imaging guidance, but fluoroscopy or ultrasound may be useful if a specific compartment is to be targeted. 

4. Based on the scoring criteria, the ordered scan (MRI of the left wrist without and with IV contrasts) is usually not appropriate as the next study after radiographs for suspected wrist infections. Instead, joint aspiration is recommended as the next appropriate procedure. If further imaging is needed after aspiration, MRI with IV contrast may be considered to delineate the location and extent of soft-tissue abscesses, especially in chronic cases. However, it is not the first-line imaging study in this scenario.",USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE,Joint aspiration,"Metadata: description:  Chronic wrist pain. Routine radiographs normal or nonspecific.

Radiographs  
While there is no recent literature that directly addresses the role of first-line examinations for chronic wrist pain, 
radiographs are usually  appropriate as an initial study. Radiographs are widely available , and for many bone, 
joint, and alignment abnormalities, radiographs alone are diagnostic. In other patients, nonspecific radiologic findings (including those in the soft  tissues) combined with the history and physical examination may be 
sufficient for clinical diagnosis, or may suggest preferred secondary imaging studies.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 10 Chronic Wrist Pain  importantly, though, the finding of enhancing bone marrow “edema” (osteitis) on MRI studies in patients with 
early RA is proving to be the best single predictor of future disease progression and functional dete rioration, even 
compared to serologies and clinical measures [27, 28,32-34].  
US Wrist  
The diagnosis of a specific inflammatory arthritis is typically established based on clinical and laboratory 
analysis. Advanced imaging is usually performed to determine disease activity, guide management decisions, and prognosticate outcomes. In patients with RA, US  of the wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints can  show 
inflammation  as active synovitis. Identifying active synovitis with power Doppler assessment is a useful adjunct 
in making an early diagnosis of RA when a pati ent with early arthritis does not meet the 2010 criteria established 
by the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism [20]. The presence of 
synovitis predicts progression of erosions [31 ] and erosions themselves [35]. US can also depict small bone 
erosions with high spatial resolution; h owever, US is less sensitive to erosions that occur on the radial or ulnar 
sides of the inner carpal bones because direct scanning of these regions is blocked, unlike the dorsal and volar 
bone surfaces. Furthermore, unlike MRI, US cannot show changes within the bone marrow, which are  the 
strongest prognosticator s for disease progression in RA [27, 28,32-34].  In patients with established inflammatory 
arthritis who are undergoing therapy, judging progression or reduction of synovitis may be more difficult with 
sequential US compared to sequential MRI.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
MR arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected inflammatory 
arthritides. 
CT Wrist  
While CT is more sensitive than radiographs for erosions, CT is not routinely used for the diagnosis and 
management of patients with suspected inflammatory arthritides .

The diagnosis of a specific inflammatory arthritis is typically established based on clinical and laboratory 
analysis. Advanced imaging is usually performed to determine disease activity, guide management decisions, and 
prognosticate outcomes. In patients with early RA and other inflammatory arthritides , active synovitis may be 
better quantified following MRI with IV contrast administration, possibly  if performed dynamically, allowing 
confident early diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment guidance in these patients  [27,28]. Additionally, 
inflammatory tenosynovitis may be more conspicuous after IV  contrast administration [29]. As is the case for any 
tomographic study, MRI is much more sensitive than radiographs for identifying erosions in RA [30 ,31]. More

Aspiration  Wrist  
No literature directly addresses the appropriateness of imaging studies beyond radiographs in patients with 
suspected infection in the wrist. However, generalizing from experience with septic arthrit is in other joints, joint 
aspiration should not be delayed in order to obtain advanced imaging studies. In cases of suspected septic arthritis, 
percutaneous aspiration of the wrist is indicated, even when radiographs appear normal. Aspirates should be 
analyzed by cell count, gram stain, and appropriate cultures. Microscopic crystal analysis should also be obtained 
if there is a possibility of gout, acute pseudogout, or hydroxyapatite deposition disease. Aspiration can be 
performed without imaging guidance i f the joint is distended, but either fluoroscopy or US  may be useful if a 
specific compartment is to be targeted.  
MRI Wrist  
There may be a role for MRI with IV contrast enhancement in the staging of infections (for example, to delineate the location and extent of soft-tissue abscesses)  after aspiration has been performed.  Especially in chronic cases, 
MRI with IV contrast may be useful to identify a fluid collection or joint effusion to target  for aspiration.  
However, MRI is usually not appropriate as the next study after radiographs for suspected wrist infections.

MRI Wrist  
Both traumatic and degenerative lesions of the TFCC can produce chronic, ulnar -sided wrist pain . MRI is highly 
accurate for lesions involving the radial (central) zone of the disc, especially with the use of high -resolution fast 
spin-echo or 3-D grad ient-recalled pulse sequences [36]. There is some evidence suggesting that MRI performed 
with a 3.0 T system is even more accurate than MRI performed with a 1.5 T system for TFCC lesions [37], but 
there are no studies comparing the accuracy of the two field s trengths in the same patients. The sensitivity for 
tears of the ulnar attachment of the disc and the peripheral attachments (the ulnocarpal ligaments) are only fair 
with noncontrast -enhanced wrist MRI [ 12,36]. IV contrast seldom provides added benefit in patients with ulnar -
sided wrist pain but may increase sensitivity for TFCC lesions if MR arthrography is desired but direct joint 
injection is not feasible.",True
