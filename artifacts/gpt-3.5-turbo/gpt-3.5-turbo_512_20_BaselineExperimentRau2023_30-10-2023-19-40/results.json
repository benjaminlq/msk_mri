Ho wever, as with conventional CT, CT \nmyelography is inferior to MRI in assessing cord contus ion, cord hemorrhage, and postganglionic nerve root \ninjuries [40,41,43,57].

However, CT is significantly \ninferior to MRI in identifying many soft-tissue pathologies,  such as cord contusion, epidural hematoma, and nerve \nroot avulsions that can cause neurologic deficits re quiring surgical intervention [40,41,43,57]. Therefore, CT \nshould not be considered adequate for excluding signifi cant soft-tissue pathology in patients presenting with \nthoracolumbar spine trauma and neurologic deficit. \nMRI Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nMRI should be performed in patients who have possible spinal  cord injury, in whom there is clinical concern for \ncord compression that is due to disc protrusion or hema toma, and in those suspected of ligamentous instability. \nMRI is valuable for characterizing the cause of myelopathy in  patients with spinal cord  injury.

MRI has been shown to have similar performance to CT in the evaluation of Hill-Sachs \nlesions and glenoid bone loss [12,18]. MR arthrography has also been found to be reliable in diagnosi ng anterior \nshoulder instability and labroligamentous injuries [58,59].

MR arthrogr aphy has also outperformed noncontrast MRI in diagnosis of \nrotator cuff tears [17,19], which is a common associated finding in older patients with shoulder dislocation. \nHowever, high sensitivities reported for MR arthrography in the detection of labral pathology may not be \napplicable to patients with clinically unstable shoulders. A retrospective review of 90 patients with clinically \nunstable shoulders selected for arthroscopy [ 60] found that MR arthrography had a sensitivity of 65% for \ndetection of labral  tears.

Spaeth et al [ 63] reported a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 94% for detection of displaced ulnar \ncollateral ligament tears in 16 cadaveric specimens.  \nUS Hand  \nA Stener lesion occurs when the aponeurosis of the adductor pollicis muscle becomes interposed between the \nruptured ulnar collateral ligament of the thumb and its site  of insertion at the base of the proximal phalanx. This \nlesion can be identified by absence of ulnar collateral ligament and the presence of a hypoechoic mass proximal to \nthe apex of the metacarpal tubercle [64]. Dynamic examination shows the relationship of the aponeurosis to the \nretracted ligament stump [65] . \nUS allows for diagnosis of pulley system injuries [ 66,67]. \nBone Scan Hand \nBone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  \nVariant 6: Initial radiographs showing metaca rpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, or distal \ninterphalangeal joint malalignment in the absence of fracture. Next imaging study.  \nCT Hand  \nCT has limited use for the diagnosis of soft -tissue injuries of the fingers.  \nMRI Hand  \nMRI is ideal for evaluating tendon injuries and helping with surgical planning [58]. MRI may be used to assess \ncapsule and collateral ligament injuries of the proximal interphalangeal  and metacarpophalangeal joints [68]. \nFor flexor tendon injuries, Rubin et al [ 69] reported a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of  100% in cadavers.", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "ACR acute hand and wrist trauma.pdf"}, "score": 0.8544408444541162}, {"page_content": "Bone Scan Wrist  \nBone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  \nVariant 4: Initial radiographs showing distal radioulnar joint or carpal malalignment in the absence of \nfracture.
