The downside of this option is that it \nresults in delay of diagnosis , which may lead to functional impairment . \nCT Area of Interest  \nWhen the initial radiographs are equivocal, CT  without IV contrast  is commonly used to exclude or confirm \nsuspected wrist fractures [18].

According to the National \nHospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey , 1.5% of all emergency department visits involve  hand and wrist \nfractu res. Distal radius fractures are especially common, accounting for up to 18% of fractures in the elderly [ 2,3]. \nBecause of increasing rates of osteoporosis, the incidence of distal radius fractures has been increasing [ 4]. \nAlthough most distal radius fractures in e lderly patients are managed non operatively, the use of internal fixation is \nincreasing. Internal fixation has a much higher cost than nonopera tive treatment as well as increased rates of \nhospitalization [5]. \nFor most patients with trauma to the hand and wrist, conventional radiographs provide sufficient diagnostic \ninformation to guide the treating physician.  However, delayed diagnosis is common because distal radius and \nscaphoid fractures may be radiographically occult  [6].

Delays \nin diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -\nand long-term mortality [6-13].

A later study by  Rubin et al [51] comparing bone scan s and \nMRI demonstrated i mproved sensitivity and specificity of MRI relative to bone scans . Moreover, t he bone scan \ngroup averaged an additional day to surgery.  \nBone scintigraphy is a time-consuming process. Bone scans may be falsely negative for up to 72 hours from the \ntime of in jury, and false-positive scans are likewise common, related to osteoarthritis, soft -tissue injury , or any \nother process that may increase bone turnover [50] . It has been postulated that performing single -photon emission \ncomputed tomography may combine the sensitivity of bone scintig raphy with the spatial accuracy of CT , but there \nare no data to support this view.

Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type \nresult in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men \n[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs \nwill continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of \nlife following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays \nin diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -\nand long-term mortality [6-13]. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of hip fractures is critical. Hip fractures \ncannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded on the basis of physical exam ination  alone ; therefore , imaging plays a \nkey role in early  and accurate diagnosis [14] .", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "ACR acute hip pain suspected fracture.pdf", "mode": "tabular", "condition": "acute hip pain suspected fracture"}, "score": 0.7417709863684517}], "appropriateness": "Usually Appropriate", "recommendation": "MRI pelvis and affected hip without IV contrast"}, {"question": "Patient Profile: 50 year old Chinese male.

Chronic ankle  pain can be caused by a variety \nof osseous or soft -tissue abnormalities, either alone or in combination. For assessing chronic ankle pain, there are \nmultiple imaging options, including radiography, stress radiography,  computed tomography (CT)  radionuclide \nbone scanning, ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and various injection procedures. Injection \nproce dures include arthrography, CT arthrography, MR arthrography, and diagnostic injection with anesthetic \nagents. Although there are numerous causes for chronic ankle pain, common etiologies include osteoarthritis, \nosteochondral injury, tendon abnormalities, ligament abnormalities and instability, and impingement.  \nOverview of Imaging Modalities  \nRadiography Radiographs can provide information about the osseous and soft -tissue structures about the ankle.

Kransdo rf, MD.q \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nAnkle pain is considered chronic when symptoms persist > 6 weeks. Chronic ankle  pain can be caused by a variety \nof osseous or soft -tissue abnormalities, either alone or in combination. For assessing chronic ankle pain, there are \nmultiple imaging options, including radiography, stress radiography,  computed tomography (CT)  radionuclide \nbone scanning, ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and various injection procedures. Injection \nproce dures include arthrography, CT arthrography, MR arthrography, and diagnostic injection with anesthetic \nagents. Although there are numerous causes for chronic ankle pain, common etiologies include osteoarthritis, \nosteochondral injury, tendon abnormalities, ligament abnormalities and instability, and impingement.  \nOverview of Imaging Modalities  \nRadiography Radiographs can provide information about the osseous and soft -tissue structures about the ankle. Routine \nradiographs of the ankle typically include anteroposterior, lateral, and mortise views, the latter obtained by internally rotating the foot 15 to 20 degrees.", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "ACR chronic ankle pain.pdf", "mode": "tabular", "condition": "chronic ankle pain"}, "score": 0.7263082720291509}, {"page_content": "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 6 Chronic Ankle Pain  osteochondral abnormalities  [14-16], although one study found statistically significant lower sensitivity for these \nabnormalities on MR I as compared to arthroscopy [ 17]. MRI can  identify synovitis and impingement lesions, \nwhich  can contribute to patient symptoms  [18].  \nDiscussion of Procedures  by Variant  \nVariant 1: Chronic ankle pain. Initial imaging . \nRadiography \nRadiography should be considered as the initial imaging study . Radiographs may reveal osteoarthritis, calcified or \nossif ied intra -articular bodies, osteochondral abnormalities, stress fractures,  or evidence of prior trauma. Ankle \neffusions may also be identified in the anterior ankle joint recess by radiography with 53% to 74% accuracy  [19]. \nThey are often associated with ligamentous injury or fracture [19]. The presence of ossific fragments can indicate \nligamentous injury or retinaculum avulsion [20], whereas periostitis can occur adjacent to tenosynovitis. \nRadiographs can also identify synovial osteochondromatosis and erosions from chronic synovitis.  \nCT \nCT is not routinely used as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain.  \nMRI  \nMRI is not routinely used as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain.  \nUS \nUS is not routinely used  as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain.  \nBone Scan  \nBone scan is not routinely used as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain.  \nVariant 2: Chronic ankle pain.

The choice of imaging modality depends on the patient\u2019s \npresentation and the clinical questions being asked. There are scenarios in which no imaging beyond baseline \nradiographs is necessary, but in other situations advanced imaging has added value for diagnostic eva luation and \ntreatment planning.  \nOverview of Imaging Modalities  \nRadiographs  \nImaging evaluation of the painful wrist should begin with radiog raphs [1,2]. This simple study may establish a \nspecific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, \nimpaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -\nanterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or \nmore oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling \n[3]. A v ariety of stress positions and maneuvers can be performed to elicit dynamic instability that is not visible \non standard radiographs [ 4]. Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. \nAdditionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ].", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "ACR chronic hand and wrist pain.pdf", "mode": "tabular", "condition": "chronic hand and wrist pain"}, "score": 0.6894895959559383}, {"page_content": "Furthermore, conventional \narthrography is unable to show extra -articular findings (like ganglion cysts and tendon disorders) that can cause \nradial -sided pain, further limiting its usefulness in  this patient population . \nBone Scan  Wrist  \nBone scan is not routinely used to further evaluate radial -sided chronic wrist pain when radiographs are normal or \nnonspecific.", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "ACR chronic hand and wrist pain.pdf", "mode": "tabular", "condition": "chronic hand and wrist pain"}, "score": 0.6944730378603791}, {"page_content": "With or without prior injury.

Advanced imaging is usually performed to determine disease activity, guide management decisions, and prognosticate outcomes. In patients with RA, US  of the wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints can  show \ninflammation  as active synovitis. Identifying active synovitis with power Doppler assessment is a useful adjunct \nin making an early diagnosis of RA when a pati ent with early arthritis does not meet the 2010 criteria established \nby the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism [20]. The presence of \nsynovitis predicts progression of erosions [31 ] and erosions themselves [35]. US can also depict small bone \nerosions with high spatial resolution; h owever, US is less sensitive to erosions that occur on the radial or ulnar \nsides of the inner carpal bones because direct scanning of these regions is blocked, unlike the dorsal and volar \nbone surfaces. Furthermore, unlike MRI, US cannot show changes within the bone marrow, which are  the \nstrongest prognosticator s for disease progression in RA [27, 28,32-34].

Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a \nsignificant improvement in health-related quality of life with effective treatment of foot pain [3] . Estimating the \nprevalence of chron ic foot pain is challenging, because there is no consensus regarding the definition of chronic \npain in the literature. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines chronic pain as any pain persisting \npast the normal healing time, suggesting 3 months in case of chronic pain of benign causes.  \nWomen are more commonly affected , and forefoot conditions are more frequent. Persistent pain for more than 6  \nyears has been reported in 51% of women between 70 to 75 years of age [4]. Because of  the wide range of causes \nof chronic foot pain, assessment of these patients with imaging studies in addition to a dedicated clinical \nexamination is often needed [1] .", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "ACR chronic foot pain.pdf", "mode": "tabular", "condition": "chronic foot pain"}, "score": 0.704442819940889}, {"page_content": "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 7 Chronic Foot Pain  CT Foot  \nThere is no relevant literature  to support the routine use of CT in the evaluation of a patient with clinical suspicion \nof pathology of the plantar fascia.  \nMRI Foot  \nMRI allows accurate characterization of the pl antar fascia and adjacent soft -tissues and bones, and several imaging \nfindin gs have been described in patients with plantar fasciitis and partial or complete tears of the plantar fascia on \nMRI [52].

This simple study may establish a \nspecific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, \nimpaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -\nanterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or \nmore oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling \n[3].

The choice of imaging modality depends on the patient\u2019s \npresentation and the clinical questions being asked. There are scenarios in which no imaging beyond baseline \nradiographs is necessary, but in other situations advanced imaging has added value for diagnostic eva luation and \ntreatment planning.  \nOverview of Imaging Modalities  \nRadiographs  \nImaging evaluation of the painful wrist should begin with radiog raphs [1,2]. This simple study may establish a \nspecific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, \nimpaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -\nanterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or \nmore oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling \n[3]. A v ariety of stress positions and maneuvers can be performed to elicit dynamic instability that is not visible \non standard radiographs [ 4]. Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. \nAdditionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ].", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "ACR chronic hand and wrist pain.pdf", "mode": "tabular", "condition": "chronic hand and wrist pain"}, "score": 0.7216533288100574}, {"page_content": "Furthermore, conventional \narthrography is unable to show extra -articular findings (like ganglion cysts and tendon disorders) that can cause \nradial -sided pain, further limiting its usefulness in  this patient population . \nBone Scan  Wrist  \nBone scan is not routinely used to further evaluate radial -sided chronic wrist pain when radiographs are normal or \nnonspecific.", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "ACR chronic hand and wrist pain.pdf", "mode": "tabular", "condition": "chronic hand and wrist pain"}, "score": 0.7279023611224789}, {"page_content": "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 11 Chronic Wrist Pain  CT Wrist  \nWhile CT with IV contrast enhancement can depict abscesses, it is usually not appropriate  for evaluation of \nsuspected wrist infections.  \nCT Arthrography  Wrist  \nCT arthrography is not routinely used to eval uate suspected wrist infection.  \nUS Wrist  \nThere may be a role for US in the staging of infections (for example, to delineate the location and e xtent of soft -\ntissue abscesses) after aspiration has been performed.

As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs \nwill continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of \nlife following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays \nin diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -\nand long-term mortality [6-13]. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of hip fractures is critical. Hip fractures \ncannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded on the basis of physical exam ination  alone ; therefore , imaging plays a \nkey role in early  and accurate diagnosis [14] .", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "ACR acute hip pain suspected fracture.pdf", "mode": "tabular", "condition": "acute hip pain suspected fracture"}, "score": 0.7414621344807014}, {"page_content": "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 11 Imaging After Total Hip Arthroplasty  hip replacements and 33 patients  who had pain in the hip after arthroplasty  and radiologic  findings  consistent  with \ncomponent  loosening (6 of whom  had infection ).

A wide variety  of pathological  entities  may cause hip pain, \nincluding  osseous  as well as intra- or extra -articular  soft tissue abnormalities  [5-7]. Pathology  involving  the lumbar  \nspine,  sacroiliac,  or knee  joints  can also cause hip pain [8], and these  etiologies  should  be investigated  as needed . \nThere is limited  original  research  that specifically  targets the imaging  of chronic  hip pain,  but imaging  of specific  \nconditions  is widely  discussed  in the published  literature. \nBefore  imaging,  an appropriate  assessment  of a patient\u2019s  clinical  history  and physical  examination  is essential  in \ntrying  to pare down the range  of possible etiologies  for a patient\u2019s  symptoms.", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "ACR chronic hip pain.pdf", "mode": "tabular", "condition": "chronic hip pain"}, "score": 0.6923988135512807}, {"page_content": "CT Hip Without  IV Contrast  \nIntra -articular  sources of pain such as synovitis,  whether  inflammatory  (eg, Lyme  disease),  proliferative  (eg, \nsynovial  chondromatosis),  or neoplastic (eg, chondroma),  are well demonstrated  on MRI.

This pain may be the result of either fracture (the clavicle, scapula, or proximal humerus) or soft -tissue \ninjury (most commonly of the rotator cuff, acromioclavicular ligaments, or labroligamentous complex). The \nincidence of traumatic shoulder injuries is difficult to determine because some injury types, such as low-grade \nacromioclavicular separations or acute rotator cuff tears, are likely under -reported because patients  do not seek \nimmediate medical treatment. However, as with many traumatic injuries, traumatic shoulder pain tends to \ndisproportionately involve young adults and male patients [ 1,2]. \nThe etiology of traumatic shoulder pain can often be made based on clinical examination, radiographs, and \nmechanism of injury. Traumatic shoulder injuries can generally be separated into in juries requiring acute surgical \nmanagement and injuries in which conservative management can be attempted prior to considering surgical \ntreatment.

This pain may be the result of either fracture (the clavicle, scapula, or proximal humerus) or soft -tissue \ninjury (most commonly of the rotator cuff, acromioclavicular ligaments, or labroligamentous complex). The \nincidence of traumatic shoulder injuries is difficult to determine because some injury types, such as low-grade \nacromioclavicular separations or acute rotator cuff tears, are likely under -reported because patients  do not seek \nimmediate medical treatment. However, as with many traumatic injuries, traumatic shoulder pain tends to \ndisproportionately involve young adults and male patients [ 1,2]. \nThe etiology of traumatic shoulder pain can often be made based on clinical examination, radiographs, and \nmechanism of injury. Traumatic shoulder injuries can generally be separated into in juries requiring acute surgical \nmanagement and injuries in which conservative management can be attempted prior to considering surgical \ntreatment.

Although bone scans may reveal focal uptake at the site of a radiographically \noccult fracture, given the anatomical complexity of the foot particularly the midfoot, precise localization may be \nlimited [59].

The International Association for the Study of Pain defines chronic pain as any pain persisting \npast the normal healing time, suggesting 3 months in case of chronic pain of benign causes.  \nWomen are more commonly affected , and forefoot conditions are more frequent. Persistent pain for more than 6  \nyears has been reported in 51% of women between 70 to 75 years of age [4].

Fr om 1998 to 2011, there was \nan adjusted annual increase of approximately 8% in thor acolumbar spine fractures in patients involved in motor \nvehicle collisions [15]. Thoracolumbar fractures are cha llenging to identify clinically, with only 48% to 75% of \nthoracolumbar injuries identified on clinical examination [16-18]. Unlike cervical injuries, well-defined clinical \ncriteria have not been established to determine when thor acolumbar imaging is appropriate in the setting of blunt \ntraumatic injury. Since clinical examination has poor sen sitivity for identifying thoracolumbar injuries, any high-\nrisk patient (mid line thoracolumbar tenderness, high-energ y mechanism of injury, or >60 years of age), as well as \nunexaminable patients (intoxicated, GCS <15, distracting injury), should undergo imaging of the thoracolumbar \nspine. Screening of the entire spine is advised, as an es timated 20% of spine injuries will have a second associated \nspinal injury at a noncontiguous level [26,27]. \nRadiography  Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nIt is well established that CT outperforms radiographs in  the diagnosis of thoracolumbar spine fractures [104-\n108]. Radiographs have a reported sens itivity of 49% to 62% for identifying thoracic spine fractures and 67% to \n82% sensitivity for identifying lumbar spine fractures [ 104,107,108] compared with the reported sensitivity of \n94% to 100% for identifying thoracolumbar spine fract ures using CT [104,107,108].", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "ACR suspected spine trauma.pdf", "mode": "tabular", "condition": "suspected spine trauma"}, "score": 0.7308060757524172}, {"page_content": "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 18 Suspected Spine Trauma Variant 10: Age greater than or equal to 16 years.
