Bone  Scan  Area  of Interest  
Because of  poor spatial  resolution,  low specificity,  and the inability  to quantify  the size of the necrotic lesion , bone  
scintigraphy is not beneficial  for characterization  of osteonecrosis.  SPECT may improve  the accuracy  of bone  
scintigraphy [30,32,33]  for detection  of osteonecrosis,  but its use has not been  widely  accepted . In addition,  few 
studies suggest  that bone  scan may be used to screen  for multifocal osteonecrosis [34,35] .

There is limited  evidence to support  the use of CT without  and with IV contrast  as the next imaging  study for 
clinically  suspected  osteonecrosis following  radiographs.   
CT Area  of Interest  Without IV Contrast  
CT is less sensitive  than bone  scintigraphy  and MRI  for the detection  of early  osteonecrosis [36]. Once an 
insufficiency  fracture  occurs,  CT is superior  to MRI in showing  location  and extent  of articular  collapse [37,38] . 
CT also shows osseous details  of secondary  osteoarthritis  well. 
MRI Area  of Interest  Without  and With  IV Contrast  
MRI with dynamic  contrast  enhancement  has been  shown  to be useful  to differentiate  osteonecrosis from  transient  
bone  marrow  edema  syndrome  and subchondral  insufficiency  fracture  [39]. Transient  bone  marrow  edema show s 
subchondral  spot of marked  hyperperfusion (plasma flow) , whereas osteonecrosis  shows a rim of high plasma flow 
surrounding a subchondral  area without  flow [40]. This rim is thought  to represent  granulation  tissue.  Higher  slope  
of enhancement  and maximum enhancement  in epiphysis  was seen in transient  bone  marrow  edema than in 
subchondral  fracture.  Osteonecrosis showed  overall  decreased  maximal  enhancement  [41]. 
MRI Area  of Interest  Without  IV Contrast  
MRI is the most  sensitive and specific imaging  modality  for the diagnosis  of osteonecrosis,  with a sensitivity  and 
specificity  nearing 100%  [24,28,42] .

found  no statistically  significant  difference between  MRI and contrast -enhanced  CT imaging  in determining  tumor  
involvement  of muscle,  bone,  joint, or neurovascular  structures.  Therefore,  CT with IV contrast  remains an 
important  adjunct  in the evaluation  of a soft tissue mass.  
The advent  of virtual noncontrast  reconstruction  with modern dual-source CT scanners allows  for acquisition  of a 
single  postcontrast  scan with reconstruction  of virtual noncontrast  images,  which  can preclude  the need  for a 
separate precontrast  scan phase [31]. Similar  to CT without  IV contrast  [21, 22], virtual noncontrast  imaging  allows 
distinction  of ossification  from  calcification  and identification  of characteristic patterns of mineralization  [29,30]  
and is particularly  useful  in assessment  of mass  mineralization  in areas where the osseous anatomy is complex  or 
obscured  and radiographs  would be less sensitive.

Page Content: MRI Lumbar Spine Without and With IV Contrast  
MRI lumbar  spine  without  and with IV contrast  is useful  for this group.  For malignant/metastatic  disease,  MRI is 
preferred  as both bony/marrow  involvement  and neural  compression  from  epidural  tumor  are visualized  with high 
spatial  resolution  [62]. In a patient  with suspected  spinal  infection, MRI without  and with IV contrast  is preferred  
because of its  high sensitivity  and specificity. MRI can localize  the site of infection  and assess the extent  of 
extradural/epidural  and paravertebral  involvement  [65,67] , and is helpful  to distinguish  abscess from  phlegmon 
[67]. 
MRI Lumbar Spine Without IV Contrast  
MRI lumbar  spine  without  IV can be a sufficient  imaging  study  if there is low risk of epidural  and/or  intraspinal  
disease.  It is highly  sensitive for bone  marrow  abnormalities , and with a combination of noncontrast  T1-weighted  
and short tau inversion recovery sequences it can distinguish whether  they are benign or malignant  [62]. 
Radiography Lumbar  Spine  
Sensitivity  of radiography is markedly  limited  for metastases [64]. MRI is preferred  to radiography because of its  
higher  sensitivity  and specificity  for osseous lesions and for its ability  to assess soft-tissue abnormalities  [69,70] .

Page Content: MR arthrography has been shown 
to be equivalent to CT in the assess ment of glenoid and humeral head bone loss [ 12,18], while being superior to 
CT in assessment of labroligamentous in juries [12]. MR arthrography is also able to delineate humeral head and 
glenoid cartilage, which can be important because some Hill -Sachs lesions affect  cartilage only  [11]. 
CT Shoulder  
Noncontrast CT has historically been used to assess Hill -Sachs and bony Bankart lesions. However, MRI has 
been shown to be equivalent to CT for a ssessing both glenoid and humeral head bone loss [ 12,18,53], and CT is 
limited in the assessment of cartilaginous Hill -Sachs lesions [11]. In addition, CT cannot assess injury to 
soft-tissue structures like the labroligamentous complex, which further limits its usefulness in evaluating Bankart 
lesions. CT should be reserved for patients with a contraindication to MRI or patients in whom MRI assessment 
of bone loss is limited.  
CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
CT arthrography has sho wn fair agreement between observers and is comparable to MR arthrography in 
diagnosing Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions [ 12,13]. However, CT arthrography is inferior to MRI in diagnosing 
other soft -tissue pathology [ 12]. CT arthrography can be considered a reasonable imaging alterna tive in patients 
with contraindication to MRI.

Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions are common findings associated with transient shoulder dislocation. Bankart 
lesions have a particularly high association with transient shoulder dislocations [50], and a transient shoulder 
dislocation should be presumed if a Bankart lesion is present. A close association exists bet ween Bankart and 
Hill-Sachs lesions [ 51], and one should be sought out whenever the other is identified on radiographs. Both 
Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions can present as nonosseous  lesions that are occult on r adiographs and noncontrast 
CT. 
MRI Shoulder  
Similar to MR arthrography, noncontrast MRI is comparable to CT in evaluating glenoid and humeral head bone 
loss [12,18]. In general, noncontrast MRI performs well in diagnosing labroligamentous injuries [ 20,52]. 
However, noncontrast MRI is considered inferior to MR arthrography for assessing labroligamentous pathology 
frequently associated with Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions [ 17,19]. Noncontrast MRI is a good alternative to MR 
arthrography in the setting of acute injury when significant glenohumeral joint effusion is present to assist in 
visualization of intra -articular soft -tissue pathology.  
MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography is the preferred study for evaluating subacute or chronic Bankart lesions because of  its soft -
tissue contrast. Multiple studies have shown MR arthrography to be reliable in diagnosing labroligamentous 
injuries [12,17,52] and superior to noncontrast MRI for this indication [ 17,19].

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 13 Shoulder Pain –Traumatic  studies [60]. For example, patient groups were identified at the time of arthroscopy, which selected patients with 
proven labral lesions as the study population instead of evaluating all patients with clinically unstable shoulders. 
Compared to noncontrast  MRI, MR arthrography  has been shown to have increased sensitivity for detection of 
anterior labral and SLAP tears [19]. In addition, MR arthrography has been shown to detect unsuspected labral 
pathology in patients referred for imaging with low or no clinical suspicion of labral pathology [66]. 
MRI Shoulder  
MRI without contrast may be preferred to MR arthrography in the setting of acute shoulder dislocation w hen a 
post-traumatic joint effusion is typically present to provide sufficient visualization of soft -tissue structures. In the 
subacute or chronic setting, the glenohumeral joint effusion is usually too small to provide adequate joint 
distention to adequat ely assess soft-tissue structures. Non contrast MRI has been shown to be inferior to MR 
arthrography in diagnosing labroligamentous and rotator cuff injuries [ 17,19]. 
CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
CT arthrography provides comparable sensitivity and possibly improved specificity in detection of labral lesions 
compared to MR arthrography  [12,67] and can provide improved visualization of the bones in cases of complex 
trauma. However, interobserver variability in reporting of labral lesions is low [13]. CT arthrography has also 
been shown to be inferior to MR arthrography in assessing partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [12], which makes 
CT arthrography less desirable in patients where rotator cuff tears may be suspected. However, CT arthrography 
may be considered in a patient with shoulder dislocation/instabili ty and contraindication to MRI.  
CT Shoulder  
Noncontrast CT is unable to assess rotator cuff and labroligamentous pathology.

CT is considered inferior to MRI for diagnosing essentially all soft -tissue shoulder  injuries. 
CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
CT arthrogram , althou gh not the initial study of choice, has the advantage of characterizing both bony lesions and 
significant soft -tissue injuries. CT arthrograms have been shown to be comparable to magnetic resonance ( MR) 
arthrography in diagnosing Bankart, Hill -Sachs, super ior labral anterior -to-posterior ( SLAP), and full-thickness 
rotator cuff tears, but inferior to MR arthrography for diagnosing partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [ 12], 
including bursal -sided tears. CT arthrography has also only demonstrated modest agreement between observers in 
diagnosing anterior capsular laxity of the shoulder [ 13]. 
MRI Shoulder  
Noncontrast MR imaging ( MRI) has been shown to be effective in assessing bony morphology and bone loss in 
patients with tr aumatic shoulder injuries [ 14-18 ], and noncontrast MRI is effective in diagnosing most traumatic 
soft-tissue pathologies including labral, rotator cuff, and glenohumeral ligament injuries [ 17,19,20]. 
MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography is considered the gold standard for imaging traumatic shoulder pain [4,17,19,21]. MR 
arthrography is comparable to noncontrast MRI in assessment of extra -articular soft tissues, and MR arthrography 
has been shown to be superior to noncontrast MRI i n diagnosing intra -articular pathology like SLAP tears, 
labroligamentous injuries, and partial rotator cuff tears [17,19]. MR arthrography is comparable to CT in 
evaluating traumatic osseous lesions,  such as bony Bankart  and Hill -Sachs lesions [ 12,18].

Shoulder dislocation or instability is most co mmon in the anterior direction. Younger patients are more likely to 
have labroligamentous injury and persistent instability after dislocation compared with older patients [54]. Older 
patients are more likely to have rotator cuff tears in association with shoulder dislocation [ 55]. Coexisting 
humeral avulsion of the glenohumeral ligament and significant glenoid bone loss have been found in up to 10% of 
patients with recurrent shoulder instability [ 56], which underscores the need to assess both osseous and 
labroligamentous pathology in patients with shoulder dislocation or instability. Glenoid morphology and bone 
loss can play a significant factor in recurrent shoulder dislocations [15, 16,57], which may require bone grafting in 
order to restore stability [ 57].

However, high sensitivities reported for MR arthrography in the detection of labral pathology may not be 
applicable to patients with clinically unstable shoulders. A retrospective review of 90 patients with clinically 
unstable shoulders selected for arthroscopy [ 60] found that MR arthrography had a sensitivity of 65% for

patient selection criteria (clinically unstable in their study versus less-specific symptoms such as shoulder pain in 
others) and the interpretation of MR art hrography by experienced musculoskeletal radiologists [ 60]. For this

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 9 Chronic Foot Pain  • Variant 2:  MRI foot without IV  contrast or 3 -phase bone scan foot is usually appropriate as the next imaging 
study after negative or equivocal radiographs  in patients with pers istent posttraumatic foot pain when  clinical 
concern includes CRPS type I. Bone scan may be useful to exclude this condition, and enhanced MRI may assist 
in the diagnosis.  
• Variant 3:  MRI foot without IV contrast  is usually appropriate as the next imaging study after negative or 
equivocal radiographs in patients with chronic metat arsalgia,  including plantar great toe pain,  when clinical 
concern includes sesamoiditis, Morton’s  neuroma, intermetatarsal bursitis, chronic plantar plate injury, or 
Freiberg’s infraction. 
• Variant 4:  MRI foot without IV contrast or US foot is usually appropriate as the next imaging study after 
negative or equivocal radiographs in patients with chronic plantar heel pain w hen clinical concern includes 
plantar fasciitis or plantar fascia tear.  
• Variant 5:  MRI foot without IV contrast or CT foot without IV contr ast is usually appropriate as the next 
imaging study after negative or equivocal radiographs in patients with n onradiating chronic midfoot pain of 
suspected osseous origin when clinical concern includes occult fracture or painful accessory ossicles.  
• Varian t 6: MRI foot without IV contrast or US foot is usually appropriate as the next imaging study after 
negative or equivocal radiographs in patients with chronic foot pain resulting from e ntrapment syndromes  when 
clinical concern includes Baxter’s neuropathy.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 4 Chronic Foot Pain  Discussion of Procedures by Variant  
Variant 1: Chronic foot pain. Unknown etiology. Initial imaging.  
Bone Scan Foot  
There is no relevant literature  to support t he use of nuclear medicine studies as the first imaging  study  in the 
evaluation of chronic foot pain.  
CT Foot  
There is no relevant literature to support the use of CT as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot 
pain.  
MRI Foot  
There is no r elevant literature  to support the use of MRI as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot 
pain.  
Radiography Foot  
Conventional radiography can be useful to distinguish among different causes of chronic foot pain and is usually 
the first imag ing study in evaluating patients with chronic foot pain.  
The value of radiographs in the diagnosis of tarsal coalitions has been extensively demonstrated. Overall 
sensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs 
in the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral 
and oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar 
coalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs 
on the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have 
been found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable 
methods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  
Radiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review 
by Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for 
radiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.

Page Content: MRI Foot  
MRI is not routinely  used as the first imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the foot in the setting  of 
peripheral  neuropathy,  penetrating  trauma , or polytrauma . 
US Foot  
US is not routinely  used as the first imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the foot in the setting  of 
peripheral  neuropathy or polytrauma.  Both  radiographs  and US are useful  imaging  tools  to exclude  a foreign  body  
in the setting  of penetrating  trauma  to the foot [24]. US is the imaging  modality  of choice if the foreign  body is 
not radiopaque  (eg, wood  or plastic) , with a reported  90% sensitivity  for visualizing  wooden  foreign  bodies  in 
some  clinical  and experimental  studies [27,28] . US can identify  a foreign  body  and also help localize  it and 
determine if it involves  a tendon  or a muscle and to evaluate for an abscess.  
Variant  4: Adult  or child older  than  5 years of age. Acute trauma to the foot.  Ottawa  rules can be evaluated  
without  exclusionary  criteria.  Ottawa  rules are negative.  Suspected  pathology  in an anatomic  area  not 
addressed  by Ottawa  rules (not involving  the midfoot; eg, metatarsal -phalangeal  joint,  metatarsal,  toe, 
tendon, etc). Initial imaging.  
In clinical  situations  when  Ottawa rules  are applicable and negative , imaging may still be desired  to evaluate for 
injuries  not assessed  by the Ottawa rules.  For example,  clinical scenarios of acute foot trauma  not directly  
addressed  by the Ottawa rules include  trauma  to the metatarsal  heads  and toes and acute tendon injury.

Page Content: • Variant 3 : MRI without IV contrast or MRI without and with IV contrast is usually appropriat e as additional 
imaging following radiographs  of the foot , in diabetic patients with or without neuropathic arthropathy when 
foot swelling and ulceration is present and osteomyelitis is suspected.  These procedures are equivalent 
alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage 
the patient’s care) . The panel did not agree on recommending a Tc -99m 3-phase bone scan foot  in this clinical 
scenario . There is insufficient medical literature to conclude  whether or not a Tc-99m 3- phase bone scan 
would be of benefit . A Tc -99m 3-phase bone scan in this patient population is controversial but may be 
appropriate.
