In the setting of normal shoulder radiographs, the most common causes \nof post -traumatic shoulder pain are soft -tissue injuries such  as rotator cuff and labral tears.  \nMRI Shoulder  \nNoncontrast MRI is a reasonable imaging study in the setting of acute nonlocalized traumatic shoulder pain and \nnoncontributory radiographs. In the acute trauma setting, noncontrast MRI may be preferred to MR arthrography , \nas acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint effusion for assessment of intra -articular \nsoft-tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic \npathology such as capsular and ligament tears [34,35]. MRI is also sensitive for diagnosing bone marrow \ncontusion and has  been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries in pediatric patients [ 36,37]. \nMR Arthrography  Shoulder  \nMR arthrography has been found to be superior to noncontrast MRI in the diagnosis of labroligamentous and \npartial -thickness rotator cuff tears [17,19].

MRI is also sensitive \nfor diagnosing bone marrow contusion and has been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries \nin pediatric patients [ 36,37]. \nUS Shoulder  \nUS has limited usefulness in patients with traumatic shoulder pain that cannot be localized to the rotator cuff or \nbiceps tendon. I n the post -traumatic setting, US has been shown to detect abnormalities, including proximal \nhumeral fractures [25]; however, recent studies on US performed for non specific shoulder pain have had \nconflicting results. US  for persistent shoulder pain after trauma has been found to diagnose significant pathology, \nprimarily fractures and rotator cuff tears, in 90% of patients [ 25]. However, 40% of patients presenting with \nnonspecific shoulder pain were found to have no significant pathology on US [38]. Additionally,  US has been \ndemonstrated to be inferior to MRI in assessment of labroligamentous, osseous, and rotator cuff pathology [ 17]. \nUS can b e considered as a screening tool in patients with persistent nonspecific shoulder pain after trauma, \nparticularly in an older patient population in whom rotator cuff tears are more common.

MR arthrography has specifically o utperformed \nnoncontrast MRI in assessment of glenohumeral ligament and anterior labral injuries [ 17,19], which ar e \ncommonly seen in shoulder instability. MR arthrogr aphy has also outperformed noncontrast MRI in diagnosis of \nrotator cuff tears [17,19], which is a common associated finding in older patients with shoulder dislocation. \nHowever, high sensitivities reported for MR arthrography in the detection of labral pathology may not be \napplicable to patients with clinically unstable shoulders. A retrospective review of 90 patients with clinically \nunstable shoulders selected for arthroscopy [ 60] found that MR arthrography had a sensitivity of 65% for \ndetection of labral  tears. The authors proposed that this discrepancy with prior studies was the result of different \npatient selection criteria (clinically unstable in their study versus less-specific symptoms such as shoulder pain in \nothers) and the interpretation of MR art hrography by experienced musculoskeletal radiologists [ 60]. For this \ndocument, it is assumed the procedure is performed and interpreted by an expert.  \nMRI Shoulder  \nMRI without contrast may be pre ferred to MR arthrography in the setting of acute shoulder dislocation when a \npost-traumatic joint effusion is present to provide sufficient visualization of soft -tissue structures. In the subacute \nor chronic setting, the glenohumeral joint effusion is usually too small to provide adequate joint distention for \noptimal assessment  of soft -tissue structures. Non contrast MRI has been shown to be inferior to MR arthrography \nin diagnosing labroligamentous and rotator cuff injuries [17,19]. Non contrast MRI performs comparably to CT in \nevaluating glenoid and humeral head bone loss [ 12,18], which may obviate the need for noncontrast CT . \nCT Arthrography  Shoulder  \nCT arthrography is effective in evaluation of shoulder instability. CT arthrogr aphy is comparable to MR \narthrography in the diagnosis of Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions [12] , and moderate agreement has been found \nbetween readers for diagnosing ant erior capsule laxity on CT arthrography. However, CT arthrography has been \nshown to be inferior to MR arthrography in assessing partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [12], which makes CT \narthrography less desirable in older patients with dislocation/instability where rotator cuff tears are common. CT \narthrography may be considered in a patient with shoulder dislocation/instabili ty and contraindication to MRI.  \nCT Shoulder  \nNoncontrast CT has historically been performed to assess bone loss in patients with recurrent dislocation or \nchronic instability. However, recent studies have shown MRI to be equivalent to CT in assessment of glenoid and \nhumeral head bone loss [12,18], which places in question the need for noncontrast CT in the assessment of \nshoulder instability. Noncontrast CT is als o unable to assess rotator cuff and labroligamentous pathology \ncommonly seen in shoulder dislocations/instability. In general, CT should be reserved for patients with a \ncontraindication to MRI or patients in whom MRI assessment of bone loss is limited.  \nUS Shoulder  \nThere is no defined role for US  in the assessment of shoulder dislocation  or instability.

Radiographs are usually sufficient for  the evaluation \nof osseous \u201cmallet\u201d injuries, which include bony avulsion at the insertion of the extensor mechanism of the finger \nto the distal interphalangeal joint [16]. In these injuries, involvement of more than one -third of the articular \nsurface usually requires operative fixation.  Palmar displacement of the distal phalanx or an interfragmentary gap \nof >3 mm is also an indication for surgery [ 16]. With extensor tendon injuries, radiographs are commonly used to \nassess for bone involve ment and determine need for operative fixation [ 17]. \nCT Area of Interest  \nIn patients with intra -articular fractures seen on radiography , CT shows articular fracture fragment displacement, \ndepression, and comminution more accurately than conventional radiographs [ 7,9,10]. CT measurements of \narticular surface gap and step -off are more reproducible than radiographs [7]. The addition of 3- D surface -\nrendered reconstructions to the standard 2 -D CT images has been shown to change operative management in up to \n48% of intra -articular distal radius fractures [8]. \nThere is no evidence to support the use of CT with intravenous  (IV) contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist \ntrauma.  \nMRI Area of Interest  \nMRI is not indicated initially in this clinical setting. \nUS Area of Interest  \nUS is not indicated initially in this clinical setting. \nBone Scan Area of  Interest  \nBone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  \nVariant 2: Suspect acute hand or wrist trauma.

The downside of this option is that it \nresults in delay of diagnosis , which may lead to functional impairment . \nCT Area of Interest  \nWhen the initial radiographs are equivocal, CT  without IV contrast  is commonly used to exclude or confirm \nsuspected wrist fractures [18]. CT shows intra-articular extension of distal radius fractures more frequently than \nradiography.  Three-dimensional reconstructions can be particularly helpful in preoperative planning for complex \narticular injuries  [7,8]. \nCT should be used to exclude an occult fracture of the upper extremity. Unlike MRI, CT cannot evaluate for \nconcomitant ligamentous injuries  [19-21 ]. \nCT is useful in diagnosing injuries that are difficult to recognize on radiographs, such as carpometacarpal joint \nfracture dislocations. For metacarpal and digital  fractures, CT is usually not indicated during acute injury [ 22]. \nThere is no evidence to support the use of CT with IV contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist trauma.  \nMRI Area o f Interest  \nWhen initial radiographs are normal but there is high clinical suspicion for fracture, MRI without IV contrast can \ndetect fractures of the distal radius and carpal bones [12,23-25] . One study of patients in which the radiographic \nfindings did not explain the clinical symptoms reported that the MRI led to a change in diagnosis in 55% of \npatients and a change in patient management in 66%  [12]. However, another study of patients with acutely injured \nwrists reported that the MRI did not predict the need for treatment better than the combination of physical \nexamination and radiography [ 23].

Advanced imaging is usually performed to determine disease activity, guide management decisions, and prognosticate outcomes. In patients with RA, US  of the wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints can  show \ninflammation  as active synovitis. Identifying active synovitis with power Doppler assessment is a useful adjunct \nin making an early diagnosis of RA when a pati ent with early arthritis does not meet the 2010 criteria established \nby the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism [20]. The presence of \nsynovitis predicts progression of erosions [31 ] and erosions themselves [35]. US can also depict small bone \nerosions with high spatial resolution; h owever, US is less sensitive to erosions that occur on the radial or ulnar \nsides of the inner carpal bones because direct scanning of these regions is blocked, unlike the dorsal and volar \nbone surfaces. Furthermore, unlike MRI, US cannot show changes within the bone marrow, which are  the \nstrongest prognosticator s for disease progression in RA [27, 28,32-34].

Kransdorf, MD.o \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nHand injuries account for approximately 20% of emergency department visits [ 1]. According to the National \nHospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey , 1.5% of all emergency department visits involve  hand and wrist \nfractu res. Distal radius fractures are especially common, accounting for up to 18% of fractures in the elderly [ 2,3]. \nBecause of increasing rates of osteoporosis, the incidence of distal radius fractures has been increasing [ 4]. \nAlthough most distal radius fractures in e lderly patients are managed non operatively, the use of internal fixation is \nincreasing. Internal fixation has a much higher cost than nonopera tive treatment as well as increased rates of \nhospitalization [5]. \nFor most patients with trauma to the hand and wrist, conventional radiographs provide sufficient diagnostic \ninformation to guide the treating physician.  However, delayed diagnosis is common because distal radius and \nscaphoid fractures may be radiographically occult  [6]. When initial radiographs  are normal but there is high \nclinical suspicion for fracture, further imaging with additional radiographic pr ojections, CT, or MRI  is \nappropriate . If associated soft -tissue injury is clinically suspected, CT, CT arthrography, MR I, MR arthrography, \nor ultrasound (US) may be indicated  [7-10]. \nSuccessful treatment of distal radius fractures requires restoration of radial length, inclination, and tilt, as well as \nthe realignment of the articular fracture fragments [9,11]. The presence of a coronally  oriented fracture line, die -\npunch depression, or more than three articular fracture fragments are common indications for operative reduction \n[8]. Operative fixation resulting in < 2 mm of residual articular surface step-off is usually considered necessary to \navoid long-term complications , such as osteoarthritis [9 ,12]. \nDiscussion of Procedures by Variant  \nVariant 1: Acute blunt or penetrating trauma to the hand or wrist. Initial imaging.  \nRadiograph y Area of Interest  \nRadiography is  always indicated as the initial imaging for suspected acute hand and wrist trauma.  For m ost joints \nof the extremities, especially those involving the wrist, hand, and fingers, a radiographic examination that \nincludes only 2 views is not adequate for detecting fractures [13]. For patients with suspected  distal radius \nfractures, a 3-view examination  of the wrist  usually includes a posteroanterior (PA) , a lateral, and a 45\u00b0 \nsemi pronated oblique view  [11]. One study [ 14] reports that a fourth projection\u2014a semisupinated oblique \u2014\nincreases diagnostic yield for distal radius fractures.  \nA standard 3 -view radiographic examination of the hand shows most fractures and dislocations of the metacarpals \nand phalanges [ 13]. For phalangeal injuries, some centers include a PA examination of the entire hand, whereas \nothers limit the examination to the injured finger.  An internally rotated oblique project ion, in addition to the \nstandard externally rotated oblique, increases diagnostic yield for phalangeal fractures [15]. \n                                                 \naResearch Author, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston Salem, North Carolina.", "metadata": {"source": "ACR acute hand and wrist trauma.pdf", "page": "4"}}, {"page_content": "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 5 Acute Hand and Wrist Trauma  Most fractures of the thumb are visible on a 2-view radiographic examination, although there is a slight increase \nin dia gnostic yield with the addition of an oblique projection [ 13], which can be obtained along with a PA \nexamination of the whole hand.  \nIn patients with suspected finger tendon injuries, radiographs are used to detect fracture fragments, as large \nfragments may require open reduction and internal fixation.  Radiographs are usually sufficient for  the evaluation \nof osseous \u201cmallet\u201d injuries, which include bony avulsion at the insertion of the extensor mechanism of the finger \nto the distal interphalangeal joint [16]. In these injuries, involvement of more than one -third of the articular \nsurface usually requires operative fixation.  Palmar displacement of the distal phalanx or an interfragmentary gap \nof >3 mm is also an indication for surgery [ 16]. With extensor tendon injuries, radiographs are commonly used to \nassess for bone involve ment and determine need for operative fixation [ 17]. \nCT Area of Interest  \nIn patients with intra -articular fractures seen on radiography , CT shows articular fracture fragment displacement, \ndepression, and comminution more accurately than conventional radiographs [ 7,9,10]. CT measurements of \narticular surface gap and step -off are more reproducible than radiographs [7]. The addition of 3- D surface -\nrendered reconstructions to the standard 2 -D CT images has been shown to change operative management in up to \n48% of intra -articular distal radius fractures [8]. \nThere is no evidence to support the use of CT with intravenous  (IV) contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist \ntrauma.  \nMRI Area of Interest  \nMRI is not indicated initially in this clinical setting. \nUS Area of Interest  \nUS is not indicated initially in this clinical setting. \nBone Scan Area of  Interest  \nBone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  \nVariant 2: Suspect acute hand or wrist trauma. Initial radiographs nega tive or equivocal. Next imaging \nstudy. \nRadiograph y Area of Interest  \nIn patients with clinical suspicion of hand or wrist fracture and negative radiographs, one option is to place the \npatient in a short arm cast and repeat the radiographs at 10  to 14 days [ 13]. The downside of this option is that it \nresults in delay of diagnosis , which may lead to functional impairment . \nCT Area of Interest  \nWhen the initial radiographs are equivocal, CT  without IV contrast  is commonly used to exclude or confirm \nsuspected wrist fractures [18]. CT shows intra-articular extension of distal radius fractures more frequently than \nradiography.  Three-dimensional reconstructions can be particularly helpful in preoperative planning for complex \narticular injuries  [7,8]. \nCT should be used to exclude an occult fracture of the upper extremity. Unlike MRI, CT cannot evaluate for \nconcomitant ligamentous injuries  [19-21 ]. \nCT is useful in diagnosing injuries that are difficult to recognize on radiographs, such as carpometacarpal joint \nfracture dislocations. For metacarpal and digital  fractures, CT is usually not indicated during acute injury [ 22]. \nThere is no evidence to support the use of CT with IV contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist trauma.  \nMRI Area o f Interest  \nWhen initial radiographs are normal but there is high clinical suspicion for fracture, MRI without IV contrast can \ndetect fractures of the distal radius and carpal bones [12,23-25] . One study of patients in which the radiographic \nfindings did not explain the clinical symptoms reported that the MRI led to a change in diagnosis in 55% of \npatients and a change in patient management in 66%  [12]. However, another study of patients with acutely injured \nwrists reported that the MRI did not predict the need for treatment better than the combination of physical \nexamination and radiography [ 23].

Kransdorf,  MD.o  \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nFractures of the proximal femur (commonly referred to as hip fractures)  are a frequent  source of morbidity and \nmortality in elderly osteoporotic patients [1]. Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type \nresult in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men \n[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs \nwill continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of \nlife following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays \nin diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -\nand long-term mortality [6-13]. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of hip fractures is critical. Hip fractures \ncannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded on the basis of physical exam ination  alone ; therefore , imaging plays a \nkey role in early  and accurate diagnosis [14] . \nThe biomechanics of proximal femoral and pelvic fractures that are a result of major trauma differs as these \ninjuries may be seen in any age group, often with additional accompanying high-velocity injuri es of the abdomen \nand pelvis . Motor vehicle \u2013related trauma is the most common  mechanism. Thorough evaluation of the hip may be \nsuperseded  in these instances by the need for resuscitation and diagnosis and treatment of more urgent associated \nvascular or solid organ injuries. Imaging plays an important role not only in the diagnosis of high-velocity \nfractures but also in characterizing fracture mechanism and morphology for treatment planning purposes.  \nHowever, imaging of high-velocity hip fractures occurs in the context of a broader trauma evaluation. A full \ndiscussion of the broader imaging workup of blunt trauma is beyond the scope of this paper and will be covered in \nthe upcoming ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae titled \u201cMajor Blunt Trauma\u201d and will be made available on the \nACR website  when completed . \nTreatment  for both intra - and extracapsular proximal femoral fractures in the elderly is typically surgical fixation  \nbecause of the risk of further fracture displacement and the dangers of prolonged immobilization in the elderly \n[15]. Joint replacement may be  performed for displaced fractures of the femoral neck where the risk of femoral \nhead avascular necrosis is high. Fractures from high -force trauma are also commonly treated with surgical \nfixation for stability to reduce the risk of post -traumatic osteo arthritis. \nDiscussion of Procedures by Variant  \nVariant 1:  Acute hip pain.

Kransdorf,  MD.o  \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nFractures of the proximal femur (commonly referred to as hip fractures)  are a frequent  source of morbidity and \nmortality in elderly osteoporotic patients [1]. Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type \nresult in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men \n[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs \nwill continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of \nlife following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays \nin diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -\nand long-term mortality [6-13]. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of hip fractures is critical. Hip fractures \ncannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded on the basis of physical exam ination  alone ; therefore , imaging plays a \nkey role in early  and accurate diagnosis [14] . \nThe biomechanics of proximal femoral and pelvic fractures that are a result of major trauma differs as these \ninjuries may be seen in any age group, often with additional accompanying high-velocity injuri es of the abdomen \nand pelvis . Motor vehicle \u2013related trauma is the most common  mechanism. Thorough evaluation of the hip may be \nsuperseded  in these instances by the need for resuscitation and diagnosis and treatment of more urgent associated \nvascular or solid organ injuries. Imaging plays an important role not only in the diagnosis of high-velocity \nfractures but also in characterizing fracture mechanism and morphology for treatment planning purposes.  \nHowever, imaging of high-velocity hip fractures occurs in the context of a broader trauma evaluation. A full \ndiscussion of the broader imaging workup of blunt trauma is beyond the scope of this paper and will be covered in \nthe upcoming ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae titled \u201cMajor Blunt Trauma\u201d and will be made available on the \nACR website  when completed . \nTreatment  for both intra - and extracapsular proximal femoral fractures in the elderly is typically surgical fixation  \nbecause of the risk of further fracture displacement and the dangers of prolonged immobilization in the elderly \n[15]. Joint replacement may be  performed for displaced fractures of the femoral neck where the risk of femoral \nhead avascular necrosis is high. Fractures from high -force trauma are also commonly treated with surgical \nfixation for stability to reduce the risk of post -traumatic osteo arthritis. \nDiscussion of Procedures by Variant  \nVariant 1:  Acute hip pain. Fall or minor trauma. Suspect fracture. Initial imaging.  \nRadiography Hip \nRadiography is the initial imaging modality of choice for assessment of acute hip pain with suspected fracture , \nwith the more advanced imaging modalities reserved for instances of clinically suspected fracture in the setting of \nnegative or equivocal radiographs.

The Ottawa rules  should  not be applied  in this clinical  setting  \nbecause pain perception  may be diminished,  no point  tenderness will be elicited  with palpation,  and the patient  \nmay be able to ambulate  even  if a fracture is present  [5].

The best initial imaging study  for a foreign  body in the foot depends  on whether  or not the suspected  \nforeign  body is radiopaque  (eg, gravel,  both leaded  and nonleaded  glass,  or metal).  Radiographic  evaluation  for a \nradiopaque  foreign body has approximately  98% sensitivity  [25].

Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and \nit can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain \nwith the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. \nTypically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain \npersists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  \nimaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated \nthat approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the \nprior year) radiographs [2 ]. \nThis document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  \u22655 years of age.  The \nvariants discussed include: (1) initial exam ination ; (2) initial radiograph is normal or demonstrates a joint \neffusion; (3) initial radiogr aph demonstrates osteochondritis dissecans (OCD), loose bodies or history of cartilage,  \nor meniscal repair; (4) initial radiograph demonstrates osteoarthritis or chondrocalcinosis; and (5)  initial \nradiograph demonstrates signs of prior (chronic) knee injur y (ie, Segond fract ure, tibial spine avulsion, etc ).  \nTo evaluat e knee pain associated with other conditions, please refer to the following ACR Appropriateness \nCriteria\u00ae topic on:  \u201cOsteonecrosi s of the Hip \u201d [3] for osteonecrosis,  \u201cAcute Trauma to the Knee \u201d for acute knee \ninjuries  [4], \u201cImaging After Total Knee Arthroplasty \u201d for patients with total knee arthroplasty  [5], \u201cSoft-Tissue \nMasses \u201d for a patient with a suspected soft -tissue mass [6], \u201cPrimary Bone Tumors \u201d for a patient with a suspected \nor known bone tumor [ 7], and \u201c Chronic Extremity Joint Pain -Suspected Inflammatory Arthritis \u201d for patient with \nsuspected arthritis  or synovitis [ 8]. \nSpecial Imaging  Considerations  \nKnee radiographs  should include at least one frontal projection of one or both knees (anteroposterior, Rosenberg, \nor tunnel), a tangential patellar view , and a lateral view of the affected knee [2,9].

Limited CT without IV contrast can be used for surgical planning.  \nCT Arthrography  Knee  \nCT arthrography is not commonly utilized as a second test in pati ents with arthritis even though CT is the most \naccurate method for evaluating cartilage abnormalities extending to the articular surface that is  due to the high \nspatial resolution between the contrast and the cartilage [11].  \nMRI Knee  \nMRI without IV contrast is not usually indicated in patients for whom radiographs are diagnostic of osteoarthritis \nunless symptoms are not explained by the radiographic findings (eg, s tress fractures) or the appropriate treatment \noption requires additional imaging [11, 19]. \nGiven the increased sensitivity of MRI for osteoarthritis, MRI may be indicated when more accurate or serial \ncartilage measurements are desired [10 ,55,56]. In patients >70 years of age, a higher correlation with the \n\u201cabnormal\u201d knee being painful is present when structural abnormalities are unilateral on either radiographs or \nMRI. S ince bilateral structural abnormalities can be present with primarily unilateral symptoms, the ability to \ndiscriminate painful from nonpainful knees is limited [57] .

US can detect synovial pathology, \neffusions , and cortical erosive changes [11].

Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral \nand oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar \ncoalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs \non the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition.

CT and MRI remain the most reliable \nmethods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  \nRadiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture.

Differentiation between a bipartite \nversus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess \nwith radiographs  [12].

Kransdo rf, MD.q \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nAnkle pain is considered chronic when symptoms persist > 6 weeks. Chronic ankle  pain can be caused by a variety \nof osseous or soft -tissue abnormalities, either alone or in combination. For assessing chronic ankle pain, there are \nmultiple imaging options, including radiography, stress radiography,  computed tomography (CT)  radionuclide \nbone scanning, ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and various injection procedures. Injection \nproce dures include arthrography, CT arthrography, MR arthrography, and diagnostic injection with anesthetic \nagents. Although there are numerous causes for chronic ankle pain, common etiologies include osteoarthritis, \nosteochondral injury, tendon abnormalities, ligament abnormalities and instability, and impingement.  \nOverview of Imaging Modalities  \nRadiography Radiographs can provide information about the osseous and soft -tissue structures about the ankle. Routine \nradiographs of the ankle typically include anteroposterior, lateral, and mortise views, the latter obtained by internally rotating the foot 15 to 20 degrees.  Stress radiographs can be used to assess ankle instability  [1,2]; \nhowever , some have questioned their accuracy [3 ,4]. \nCT \nCT is not routinely used as a first -line imaging tool in chronic ankle pain, but it is more sensitive than \nradiographs, particularly for osseous abnormalities  [5]. CT arthrography may be more accurate than MR \narthrography for the identification of osteochondral abnormalities  [6]. \nBone Scan  \nConventional planar bone scintigraphy can assess osseous pathology.  More recently, single -photon emission \ncomputed tomogr aphy (SPECT)  combined with CT has been shown to provide additional information compared \nwith clinical diagnosis and conventional bone scintigraphy for the evaluation of impingement syndromes and soft -\ntissue pathology [7]. In addition, SPECT/CT abnormalities have been shown to significantly correlate with pain  in \nosteochondral lesions  [8]. \nUS \nUS can be used to evaluate for soft -tissue abnormalities, including tendon and ligament tears. In inflammatory \narthritis, it can help in the assessment of disease activity and severity as well as detect subclinical pathology in \nearly disease or after treatment [9 ]. US is ideal for dynamic assessment of peroneal tendon instability [10] and can \nbe used to guide interventions  [11]. Compared with some other modalities, US is less prone to artifacts, such as \nsusceptibility, motion, magic angle , and streak artifact, but dynamic assessment may be limited in cases of pain.  \nMRI  \nMRI is the imaging test that globally evaluates all anatomic structures, including ligaments, tendons, cartilage, \nand bone  [12,13]. Most studies have shown that MRI is highly accurate for evaluation of ligament, tendon,  and \n \naPrincipal Author and Panel Chair,  VA San Diego Healthcare System, San Diego, California . bResearch Author, University of California San Diego Medical \nCenter, San Diego, California.  cUniversity of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.  dRush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois; \nAmerican College of Physicians.  ePenn State Milton S.

Initial imaging . \nRadiography \nRadiography should be considered as the initial imaging study . Radiographs may reveal osteoarthritis, calcified or \nossif ied intra -articular bodies, osteochondral abnormalities, stress fractures,  or evidence of prior trauma. Ankle \neffusions may also be identified in the anterior ankle joint recess by radiography with 53% to 74% accuracy  [19]. \nThey are often associated with ligamentous injury or fracture [19]. The presence of ossific fragments can indicate \nligamentous injury or retinaculum avulsion [20], whereas periostitis can occur adjacent to tenosynovitis. \nRadiographs can also identify synovial osteochondromatosis and erosions from chronic synovitis.  \nCT \nCT is not routinely used as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain.  \nMRI  \nMRI is not routinely used as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain.  \nUS \nUS is not routinely used  as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain.  \nBone Scan  \nBone scan is not routinely used as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain.  \nVariant 2: Chronic ankle pain.

Because of these limitations, \narthrography  has now largely been supplanted by cross-sectional imaging. Fluoroscopic -guided intra -articular \ninjections are chiefly used as a first step when performing arthrographic  computed tomography ( CT) and \nmagnetic resonance imaging (MR I) studies [8]. \nMRI  \nWrist MRI accurately depicts abnormalities of the bones and bone marrow, articular cartilage, intrinsic and \nextrinsic ligaments, TFCC, synovium, tendons, and neurovascular structures, making it a powerful study for \nchronic pai n caused by diverse etiologies.  \nA dedicated receiver coil or transmit -receive coil is necessary to provide the signal -to-noise ratio needed for high-\nresolution, high-contrast MRI of the wrist [9 ]. MR arthrography \u2014either with direct contrast injection into one  or \nmore wrist compartments or performed indirectly after intravenous (IV) contrast administration \u2014can enhance the \nyield of the study for diagnosing internal wrist derangements, especially abnormalities of the ligaments, articular cartilage, and TFCC of the wrist. MRI performed with a 3.0 T magnet and a dedicated coil provides better signal -\nto-noise ratio and better contrast compared with wrist MR I performed with 1.5 T  or lower field strength systems \n[10,11]. \nCT \nCT of the wr ist is used primarily when high-det ail imaging of bone cortex or trabeculae is needed. In patients with \nchronic wrist pain and prior fractures, CT is typically the study of choice to evaluate fracture healing and joint \ncongruence. When a radiographically occult fracture is suspected as the cause of a patient\u2019s chronic pain, either \nCT or MRI can be used [12]. Advantages of CT over MRI for the wrist include  its ability to obtain high -resolution \nimages of both wrists simultaneously and the much shorter acquisition times for CT. These factors make CT the \npreferred examination for suspected distal radioulnar joint subluxation, where images of both wrists can be  \nobtained in both supination and pronation [1 ,13]. A disadvantage of CT  is its lower sensitivity to soft -tissue \nabnormalities  compared with MRI.  \nHigh-resolution (typically multidetector) CT of the wrist following contrast injection into one or more wrist \ncompartments (CT arthrography) is a powerful tool for diagnosing intra -articular abnormalities [14,15]. The \nintraobserver agreement on CT arthrogram images is extremely high and better than that reported for MRI \n[14,16]. \nUS \nUS of the wrist is useful for examining extra -articular soft tissues, such as suspected ganglion cyst s [17], because \nits accuracy is similar to that of MRI. US can also be used to diagnose abnormalities of the flexor and extensor \ntendons and tendon sheaths. For de Quervain disease (stenosing tenosynovitis of the abductor pollicis lon gus and \nextensor pollicis brevis tendon compartment), preoperative identification of a septum or subcompartmentalization \nwithin the first dorsal compartment with US  may affect surgical management [18 ,19]. \nIn patients with suspected or established rheumatoid arthritis (RA), US examination of the wrist and selected \nfinger joints can identify erosions and active synovit is (with the use of power Doppler), findings that influence \nearly diagnosis and treatment decisions [20]. Using US to measure the size of the median nerve is a  validated  \ntechnique in patients with clinical symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome [21-24].  \nIn addition, w rist US is a useful technique to guide therapeutic intr a-articular and other soft -tissue injections [25].  \nDiscussion of Procedures by Variant  \nVariant 1: Chronic wrist pain.

There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal \ntunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, \nclinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of \ncarpal tunnel syndrome. US may be appropriate in cases where this initial evaluation is equivocal.  \nMRI Wrist  \nHistorically, carpal tunnel syndrome has been diagnosed based on clinical signs and sympt oms and confirmed by \nthe results of electrodiagnostic studies [67]. MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in cases in which this  \ninitial evaluation is equivocal. The MRI findings that have been reported in wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome \u2014\nincluding nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing\u2014may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value \nin patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68]. In rare cases of secondary carpal tunnel syndrome, MRI may identify \na mass lesion compressing the median nerve. There is some evidence that the length of T2 hyperintensity in the \nmedian nerve can help prognosticate the success of surgery [69] and that the shape and signal of the nerve predict \nclinical response to a steroid injection in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome [70 ]. MR neurography \nmay be an option in patients with suspected carpal tunnel syndrome.

Advanced imaging is usually performed to determine disease activity, guide management decisions, and prognosticate outcomes. In patients with RA, US  of the wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints can  show \ninflammation  as active synovitis. Identifying active synovitis with power Doppler assessment is a useful adjunct \nin making an early diagnosis of RA when a pati ent with early arthritis does not meet the 2010 criteria established \nby the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism [20]. The presence of \nsynovitis predicts progression of erosions [31 ] and erosions themselves [35]. US can also depict small bone \nerosions with high spatial resolution; h owever, US is less sensitive to erosions that occur on the radial or ulnar \nsides of the inner carpal bones because direct scanning of these regions is blocked, unlike the dorsal and volar \nbone surfaces. Furthermore, unlike MRI, US cannot show changes within the bone marrow, which are  the \nstrongest prognosticator s for disease progression in RA [27, 28,32-34].  In patients with established inflammatory \narthritis who are undergoing therapy, judging progression or reduction of synovitis may be more difficult with \nsequential US compared to sequential MRI.  \nMR Arthrography  Wrist  \nMR arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected inflammatory \narthritides. \nCT Wrist  \nWhile CT is more sensitive than radiographs for erosions, CT is not routinely used for the diagnosis and \nmanagement of patients with suspected inflammatory arthritides . \nCT Arthrography  Wrist  \nCT arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected inflammatory \narthritides. \nBone Scan  Wrist  \nBone scan does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients  with suspected inflammatory \narthritides. \nArthrography  Wrist  \nRadiographic arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected \ninflammatory arthritides. \nVariant 4: Chronic wrist pain.

However, generalizing from experience with septic arthrit is in other joints, joint \naspiration should not be delayed in order to obtain advanced imaging studies. In cases of suspected septic arthritis, \npercutaneous aspiration of the wrist is indicated, even when radiographs appear normal. Aspirates should be \nanalyzed by cell count, gram stain, and appropriate cultures. Microscopic crystal analysis should also be obtained \nif there is a possibility of gout, acute pseudogout, or hydroxyapatite deposition disease. Aspiration can be \nperformed without imaging guidance i f the joint is distended, but either fluoroscopy or US  may be useful if a \nspecific compartment is to be targeted.  \nMRI Wrist  \nThere may be a role for MRI with IV contrast enhancement in the staging of infections (for example, to delineate the location and extent of soft-tissue abscesses)  after aspiration has been performed.

Overall \nsensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs \nin the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral \nand oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar \ncoalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs \non the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have \nbeen found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable \nmethods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  \nRadiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review \nby Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for \nradiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.  \nRadiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  \nusually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, \nosteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite \nversus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess \nwith radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton\u2019s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other \ncauses of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg\u2019s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals \nor soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . \nThough radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in \npatients with a painful heel.

Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a \nsignificant improvement in health-related quality of life with effective treatment of foot pain [3] . Estimating the \nprevalence of chron ic foot pain is challenging, because there is no consensus regarding the definition of chronic \npain in the literature. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines chronic pain as any pain persisting \npast the normal healing time, suggesting 3 months in case of chronic pain of benign causes.  \nWomen are more commonly affected , and forefoot conditions are more frequent. Persistent pain for more than 6  \nyears has been reported in 51% of women between 70 to 75 years of age [4]. Because of  the wide range of causes \nof chronic foot pain, assessment of these patients with imaging studies in addition to a dedicated clinical \nexamination is often needed [1] . \nThe guidelines of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons divide heel pain into plantar heel pain,  usually \nrelated to pathology of the plantar fascia, and posterior heel pain,  usually related to pathology of  the Achilles tendon, \nand treatment options vary from nonoperative treatments to surgical procedures [5] . \nChronic foot pain in children, symptoms related to soft -tissue or bone neoplasms and pain related to infectious \nconditions, inflammatory arthropathies, or other systemic diseases are beyond the scope of this document. \nEvaluation of patients with neuropathic foot or Charcot arthropathy is addressed in the ACR Appropriateness \nCriteria\u00ae topic on \u201c Suspected Osteomyelitis of the Foot in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus \u201d [6].

Advanced imaging is usually performed to determine disease activity, guide management decisions, and prognosticate outcomes. In patients with RA, US  of the wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints can  show \ninflammation  as active synovitis. Identifying active synovitis with power Doppler assessment is a useful adjunct \nin making an early diagnosis of RA when a pati ent with early arthritis does not meet the 2010 criteria established \nby the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism [20]. The presence of \nsynovitis predicts progression of erosions [31 ] and erosions themselves [35]. US can also depict small bone \nerosions with high spatial resolution; h owever, US is less sensitive to erosions that occur on the radial or ulnar \nsides of the inner carpal bones because direct scanning of these regions is blocked, unlike the dorsal and volar \nbone surfaces. Furthermore, unlike MRI, US cannot show changes within the bone marrow, which are  the \nstrongest prognosticator s for disease progression in RA [27, 28,32-34].

Kransdorf, MD.n \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nChronic foot pain is a frequent clinical complaint with approximately 14% to 42% of adults in the United States \nreporting foot problems, often with significant impact on mobility, difficulty performing daily activities , and \nincreased risk of falling, particularly in older individuals [1,2] . Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a \nsignificant improvement in health-related quality of life with effective treatment of foot pain [3] . Estimating the \nprevalence of chron ic foot pain is challenging, because there is no consensus regarding the definition of chronic \npain in the literature. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines chronic pain as any pain persisting \npast the normal healing time, suggesting 3 months in case of chronic pain of benign causes.  \nWomen are more commonly affected , and forefoot conditions are more frequent. Persistent pain for more than 6  \nyears has been reported in 51% of women between 70 to 75 years of age [4]. Because of  the wide range of causes \nof chronic foot pain, assessment of these patients with imaging studies in addition to a dedicated clinical \nexamination is often needed [1] . \nThe guidelines of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons divide heel pain into plantar heel pain,  usually \nrelated to pathology of the plantar fascia, and posterior heel pain,  usually related to pathology of  the Achilles tendon, \nand treatment options vary from nonoperative treatments to surgical procedures [5] . \nChronic foot pain in children, symptoms related to soft -tissue or bone neoplasms and pain related to infectious \nconditions, inflammatory arthropathies, or other systemic diseases are beyond the scope of this document. \nEvaluation of patients with neuropathic foot or Charcot arthropathy is addressed in the ACR Appropriateness \nCriteria\u00ae topic on \u201c Suspected Osteomyelitis of the Foot in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus \u201d [6]. Posttraumatic \nentities affecting the ankle,  including instability, arthrosis, osteochondral defects, osteonecrosis, and tendinop athies,  \nare discussed in  ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae topic on \u201cChronic Ankle Pain \u201d [7].

The utility of MRI in the detection of radiographically occult Chopart \nfractures has been demonstrated by Almeida et al [64] . Baker et al [71]  analyzed 31 occult fractures involving the \nankle and foot in h ockey players,  finding five occult fractures in the foot, all of which involved the navicular bone. \nPierre -Jerome et al [72] found 79% of cuboid fractures in the diabetic population that were radiographically occult \nusing MRI. MRI is also useful in the detection of occult fractures involving the fifth metatarsal bone (Jones fracture) \nand the subtalar join t [65,73] . There is no evidence in the literature supporting the routine use of contrast in the \ndiagnosi s of occult fractures.  \nMRI has replaced bone scans in the evaluation of symptomatic accessory ossicles. MRI allows optimal visualization \nof the bone marrow within the ossicle and visualization of the synchondrosis. Accessory ossicles may also be \nassociated  with tendon pathology, which is also well assessed on MRI [74]. MRI allows clear demonstration of the \nfindings often associated with posterior ankle impingement syndrome [75]. Contrast administration is not routinely \nperformed when assessing symptomatic accessory ossicles on MRI; however, contrast within a disrupted \nsynchondrosis may be demonstrated on MR arthrography stu dies [69]. \nUS Foot   \nAlthough not routinely performed, previous studies have demonstrated the role of US in the detection of occult foot \nfractures. On US, these can be seen as cortical irregularities and are frequently associated with soft -tissue injury in \nthe acute or subacute setting. Wang et al [76]  demonstrated 24 cases of radiographically occult ankle and foot \nfractures in 268 patients. Of these, foot fractures were found most frequently in the calcaneus and metatarsals, and \nless frequently in the navicular, cuboid , and cuneiform bones.  \nOn US, several findings have been reported in cases of painful accessory ossicles, including patients with posterior \nankle impingement syndrome ; however , optimal characterization of the synchondrosis is difficult on US [62] . High -\nresolution US offers some advantages over other imagin g modalities because it allows dynamic exploration of the \nfoot with further assessment of stability of the synchondrosis and tendon tears when present as well as direct clinical \ncorrelation and comparative evaluation with the asymptomatic foot [77] . Power Doppler US has proven useful in \nidentifying increased blood supply in the setting of ankle impingement [78,79] . \nVariant 6: Chronic foot pain. Entrapment s yndromes.

Overall \nsensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs \nin the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral \nand oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar \ncoalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs \non the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have \nbeen found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable \nmethods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  \nRadiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review \nby Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for \nradiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.  \nRadiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  \nusually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, \nosteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite \nversus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess \nwith radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton\u2019s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other \ncauses of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg\u2019s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals \nor soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . \nThough radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in \npatients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The \ncombination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a \nspecificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15]. \nUS Foot  \nUltrasound (US) is usually not indicate d as the first imaging  study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain, but may \nbe performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of pathologic conditions of the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, \nand other conditions such as tarsal tunnel syndrome, Morton\u2019s  neuroma , plantar plate tears,  and intermetatarsal \nbursitis. \nVariant 2: Persistent posttraumatic foot pain.

It has been \nshown that MRI has a significant effect in the diagnostic and therapeutic decisions made by orthopedic surgeons \nthanks to an increase in their confidence levels and change in treatment [34] . MRI is believed to be a sensitive and \nreliable method to evaluate patients with metatarsalgia and Morton\u2019s  neuroma  with a sensitivity of 87%, specificity \nof 100%, accuracy of 89%, PPV of 100% , and NPV of 60% in surgically treated patients [35] . In a meta- analysis,  \nMRI had  a pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio , and negative likelihood ratio of 93%, 68%, 1.89,  \nand 0.19, respectively [36]. Increased fluid within the intermetatarsal bursa, which suggest s bursitis, is well \ndemonstrated on MRI [37] . Although the use of gadolinium does not seem essential to detect Morton\u2019s  neuroma s \n[38], it may facilitate its detection  because of  the improved soft -tissue contrast [32,39] . \nMRI is widely accepted as the imaging study  of choice for diagnosis of plantar plate tears. In a prospective study, \nSung et al [40] found high accuracy (96%), sensitivity (95%), specificity (100%), PPV (100%), and NPV (67%) for \nMRI with surgical correlation.

Similar to MRI, US is considered a reliable method \nto evaluate patients with Morton\u2019s  neuroma . US has the advantage of allowing clinical correlation during \nexamination. High sensitivities for US and MRI (83% \u201396% and 82% \u201396%, respectively) with no significant \ndifferences between the two modalities were found in a meta- analysis [36].

Given that, some of the find ings in patients with plantar fasciitis are nonspecific; these findings can also \nbe seen in asymptomatic patients.  MRI should always be correlated with clinical symptoms to avoid overcalling \nplantar fasciitis. Although no significant differences have been found in plantar fascia thickness on US and MRI, \nMRI is currently considered the most sensitive imaging study  in the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis [53].

Next imaging study.  \nBone Scan Foot  \nBone scintigraphy is a sensitive but not specific technique to detect occult  fractures because of  its capability to \ndetect increased osteoblastic activity. Although bone scans may reveal focal uptake at the site of a radiographically \noccult fracture, given the anatomical complexity of the foot particularly the midfoot, precise localization may be \nlimited [59]. SPECT/CT may improve the diagnosis of patients with suspected fractures because of the more precise \nanatomical localization [60].  \nSymptomatic accessory navicular bones were initially studied with Tc-99m -MDP bone scans and were repo rted to \nshow increased radiotracer uptake at the synchondrosis,  apparently  due to the chronic stress reaction [61] . A \nnegative bone scan can exclude the presence of a symptomatic accessory ossicle, but positive findings lack \nspecificity [62]. Isotope bone scans , when combined with CT , may be positive in cases of painful accessory ossicles \nbut remain rel ative ly insensitive for some soft -tissue pathology [63].  \nCT Foot  \nCT is useful for the detection of radiographically occult fractures.

MRI is believed to be a sensitive and \nreliable method to evaluate patients with metatarsalgia and Morton\u2019s  neuroma  with a sensitivity of 87%, specificity \nof 100%, accuracy of 89%, PPV of 100% , and NPV of 60% in surgically treated patients [35] . In a meta- analysis,  \nMRI had  a pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio , and negative likelihood ratio of 93%, 68%, 1.89,  \nand 0.19, respectively [36]. Increased fluid within the intermetatarsal bursa, which suggest s bursitis, is well \ndemonstrated on MRI [37] . Although the use of gadolinium does not seem essential to detect Morton\u2019s  neuroma s \n[38], it may facilitate its detection  because of  the improved soft -tissue contrast [32,39] . \nMRI is widely accepted as the imaging study  of choice for diagnosis of plantar plate tears. In a prospective study, \nSung et al [40] found high accuracy (96%), sensitivity (95%), specificity (100%), PPV (100%), and NPV (67%) for \nMRI with surgical correlation. In this study,  moderate concordance was found between tear severity on MR I and \nsurgery with greater concordance at higher severity. A meta-analysis showed higher diagnostic accuracy for MRI \nthan US for the detection of plantar plate tears with sensitivity and specificity for MRI of 95% and 54%, respectively \n[41]. MR arthrography improves visualization of pericapsular structures when compared to conventional MRI and \ntherefore is useful in the diagnosis and characterization of planta r plate tears and abnormalities of related structures \n[42,43] . \nMRI may be helpful to diagnose Freiberg\u2019s infraction and several nonspecific findings have been described in early \nand chronic stages [32,44] .

Given that, some of the find ings in patients with plantar fasciitis are nonspecific; these findings can also \nbe seen in asymptomatic patients.  MRI should always be correlated with clinical symptoms to avoid overcalling \nplantar fasciitis. Although no significant differences have been found in plantar fascia thickness on US and MRI, \nMRI is currently considered the most sensitive imaging study  in the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis [53]. There is no \nrelevant literature supporting the routine use of contrast in the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis or tears.  \nUS Foot  \nUS has shown good sensitivity (80%) and specificity (88%) in the dia gnosis of plantar fasciitis when compared to \nMRI [54]. A diagnostic accuracy of 69% for abnormal focal echogenicity within the plantar fascia, 60% for edema \naround the plantar fascia, 78% for perifascial edema, 69% for rupture of the plantar fascia,  and 56% for an associated \ncalcaneal spur have been found for US, using MRI as the reference standard [55]. Kapoor et al [56]  showed higher \nsensitivity and specificity of US elastography when compared to US in the detection of plantar fasciitis (95% and \n100% versus 66% and 75%, respectively) , using  MRI as the reference standard. US has been shown to be useful in \nthe diagnosis of complete and partial tears of the plantar fascia [57]. Some authors regard US to be superior to MRI \nin differentiating true fiber interruption and tearing of the plantar fascia from edema [58]. \nVariant 5: Nonradiating chronic midfoo t pain of suspected osseous origin. Radiographs negative or \nequivocal. Clinical concern includes occult fracture, or painful accessory ossicles. Next imaging study.  \nBone Scan Foot  \nBone scintigraphy is a sensitive but not specific technique to detect occult  fractures because of  its capability to \ndetect increased osteoblastic activity. Although bone scans may reveal focal uptake at the site of a radiographically \noccult fracture, given the anatomical complexity of the foot particularly the midfoot, precise localization may be \nlimited [59]. SPECT/CT may improve the diagnosis of patients with suspected fractures because of the more precise \nanatomical localization [60].  \nSymptomatic accessory navicular bones were initially studied with Tc-99m -MDP bone scans and were repo rted to \nshow increased radiotracer uptake at the synchondrosis,  apparently  due to the chronic stress reaction [61] . A \nnegative bone scan can exclude the presence of a symptomatic accessory ossicle, but positive findings lack \nspecificity [62]. Isotope bone scans , when combined with CT , may be positive in cases of painful accessory ossicles \nbut remain rel ative ly insensitive for some soft -tissue pathology [63].  \nCT Foot  \nCT is useful for the detection of radiographically occult fractures. Almeida et al [64]  reported visualization of \nChopart fractures on  CT and/or MRI in one -third of cases initially not diagnosed on radiographs . CT also has utility \nin the diagnosis of occult fractures involving the subtalar joint as demonstrated in the study by Choi et al [6 5]. CT \nis a primary imaging technique in patients with high-energy polytrauma and complex fractures, because radiographs \nhave only poor to moderate sensitivity  in this clinical setting [66] . More recently, dual -energy CT has been reported \nas a useful technique in the detection of bone marrow edema , with excellent performance in the appendicular \nskeleton, with a sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 93% [67].

Overall \nsensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs \nin the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral \nand oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar \ncoalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs \non the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have \nbeen found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable \nmethods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  \nRadiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review \nby Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for \nradiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.  \nRadiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  \nusually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, \nosteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite \nversus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess \nwith radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton\u2019s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other \ncauses of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg\u2019s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals \nor soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . \nThough radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in \npatients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The \ncombination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a \nspecificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15]. \nUS Foot  \nUltrasound (US) is usually not indicate d as the first imaging  study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain, but may \nbe performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of pathologic conditions of the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, \nand other conditions such as tarsal tunnel syndrome, Morton\u2019s  neuroma , plantar plate tears,  and intermetatarsal \nbursitis. \nVariant 2: Persistent posttraumatic foot pain.

Because of these limitations, \narthrography  has now largely been supplanted by cross-sectional imaging. Fluoroscopic -guided intra -articular \ninjections are chiefly used as a first step when performing arthrographic  computed tomography ( CT) and \nmagnetic resonance imaging (MR I) studies [8]. \nMRI  \nWrist MRI accurately depicts abnormalities of the bones and bone marrow, articular cartilage, intrinsic and \nextrinsic ligaments, TFCC, synovium, tendons, and neurovascular structures, making it a powerful study for \nchronic pai n caused by diverse etiologies.  \nA dedicated receiver coil or transmit -receive coil is necessary to provide the signal -to-noise ratio needed for high-\nresolution, high-contrast MRI of the wrist [9 ]. MR arthrography \u2014either with direct contrast injection into one  or \nmore wrist compartments or performed indirectly after intravenous (IV) contrast administration \u2014can enhance the \nyield of the study for diagnosing internal wrist derangements, especially abnormalities of the ligaments, articular cartilage, and TFCC of the wrist. MRI performed with a 3.0 T magnet and a dedicated coil provides better signal -\nto-noise ratio and better contrast compared with wrist MR I performed with 1.5 T  or lower field strength systems \n[10,11]. \nCT \nCT of the wr ist is used primarily when high-det ail imaging of bone cortex or trabeculae is needed. In patients with \nchronic wrist pain and prior fractures, CT is typically the study of choice to evaluate fracture healing and joint \ncongruence. When a radiographically occult fracture is suspected as the cause of a patient\u2019s chronic pain, either \nCT or MRI can be used [12]. Advantages of CT over MRI for the wrist include  its ability to obtain high -resolution \nimages of both wrists simultaneously and the much shorter acquisition times for CT. These factors make CT the \npreferred examination for suspected distal radioulnar joint subluxation, where images of both wrists can be  \nobtained in both supination and pronation [1 ,13]. A disadvantage of CT  is its lower sensitivity to soft -tissue \nabnormalities  compared with MRI.  \nHigh-resolution (typically multidetector) CT of the wrist following contrast injection into one or more wrist \ncompartments (CT arthrography) is a powerful tool for diagnosing intra -articular abnormalities [14,15]. The \nintraobserver agreement on CT arthrogram images is extremely high and better than that reported for MRI \n[14,16]. \nUS \nUS of the wrist is useful for examining extra -articular soft tissues, such as suspected ganglion cyst s [17], because \nits accuracy is similar to that of MRI. US can also be used to diagnose abnormalities of the flexor and extensor \ntendons and tendon sheaths. For de Quervain disease (stenosing tenosynovitis of the abductor pollicis lon gus and \nextensor pollicis brevis tendon compartment), preoperative identification of a septum or subcompartmentalization \nwithin the first dorsal compartment with US  may affect surgical management [18 ,19]. \nIn patients with suspected or established rheumatoid arthritis (RA), US examination of the wrist and selected \nfinger joints can identify erosions and active synovit is (with the use of power Doppler), findings that influence \nearly diagnosis and treatment decisions [20]. Using US to measure the size of the median nerve is a  validated  \ntechnique in patients with clinical symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome [21-24].  \nIn addition, w rist US is a useful technique to guide therapeutic intr a-articular and other soft -tissue injections [25].  \nDiscussion of Procedures by Variant  \nVariant 1: Chronic wrist pain.

Kransdorf, MD.n \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nIn patients with chronic wrist pain, imaging studies are  an important adjunct to history, physical examination, \nlaboratory testing, and electrophysiology studies. The choice of imaging modality depends on the patient\u2019s \npresentation and the clinical questions being asked. There are scenarios in which no imaging beyond baseline \nradiographs is necessary, but in other situations advanced imaging has added value for diagnostic eva luation and \ntreatment planning.  \nOverview of Imaging Modalities  \nRadiographs  \nImaging evaluation of the painful wrist should begin with radiog raphs [1,2]. This simple study may establish a \nspecific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, \nimpaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -\nanterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or \nmore oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling \n[3]. A v ariety of stress positions and maneuvers can be performed to elicit dynamic instability that is not visible \non standard radiographs [ 4]. Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. \nAdditionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ]. \nIn the past , fluoroscopic observation was used to establish the diagnosis of dynamic wrist inst ability. However, in \nmost practices,  fluoroscopy is used either for g uidance during wrist injections  or as an adjunct to arthrography.  \nPercutaneous aspiration of the wrist \u2014which is indicated in cases of suspected septic arthritis or to assess for intra-\narticular crystals\u2014can be carried out with either fluoroscopic or ultrasound (US) guidance  if needed . \nScintigraphy  \nBone scintigraphy has been used for diagnosing occult wrist fractures and as a screening procedure in patients \nwith wrist pain and negative radi ographs. However, while it is sensitive to bone abnormalities, scintigraphy \nsuffers from a lack of specificity [6 ]. Furthermore, bone scans cannot detect soft -tissue abnormalities  such as  \nlesions of the ligaments, tendons, and cartilage, all of which are often responsible for chronic wrist pain.  \nArthrography  \nConventional (x-ray) arthrography can be performed with contrast injection into the radiocarpal joint al one or into \nthe radiocarpal, mi dcarpal, and distal radioulnar joints ( 3-phase technique) for the diagnosis of triangular \nfibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tear and intrinsic ligament perforations. A recent meta -analysis found only \nmoderate pooled sensitivity (76%) for the detection of full -thickness TFCC tears (82% for 3 -phase technique and \n72% for single -injection arthrograms)  [7]. However, arthrography is unable to reliably show the size, shape, and \nstability of TFCC defects and is insensitive to partial-thickness tears.", "metadata": {"source": "ACR chronic hand and wrist pain.pdf", "page": "7"}}, {"page_content": "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 3 Chronic Wrist Pain  Variant 5:  Ulnar -sided chronic wrist pain .

Radiographs normal or nonspecific . Next study.  \nMRI Wrist  \nBoth traumatic and degenerative lesions of the TFCC can produce chronic, ulnar -sided wrist pain . MRI is highly \naccurate for lesions involving the radial (central) zone of the disc, especially with the use of high -resolution fast \nspin-echo or 3-D grad ient-recalled pulse sequences [36]. There is some evidence suggesting that MRI performed \nwith a 3.0 T system is even more accurate than MRI performed with a 1.5 T system for TFCC lesions [37], but \nthere are no studies comparing the accuracy of the two field s trengths in the same patients. The sensitivity for \ntears of the ulnar attachment of the disc and the peripheral attachments (the ulnocarpal ligaments) are only fair \nwith noncontrast -enhanced wrist MRI [ 12,36]. IV contrast seldom provides added benefit in patients with ulnar -\nsided wrist pain but may increase sensitivity for TFCC lesions if MR arthrography is desired but direct joint \ninjection is not feasible. \nMR Arthrography  Wrist  \nDirect MR arthrography (performed with contrast injection of the radiocarpal or distal radioulnar compartments, \nalone or in combination) does result in better diagnostic accuracy for the T FCC compared with conventional MRI, \nespecially for ulnar -sided lesions [26, 38], even when compared to conventio nal MRI performed with a 3.0 T \nmagnet [7,8,39]. The same is true for intrinsic ligament injuries, such as those of the lunotriquetral ligament, \nwhich can produce ulnar -sided pain [7 ,8,39]. Performing either MR arthrography or noncontrast -enhanced MRI is \nusually appropriate in this scenario.  \nCT Arthrography  Wrist  \nThe accuracy of CT arthrography is superior to MRI  and similar to that  of MR arthrography for TFCC and \nintrinsic ligament lesions [8,40]. In addition, CT arthrography appears to be mor e accurate than either MRI or  MR \narthrography for identifying articular cartilage defects in the wrist [38].

MRI is useful for diagnosing infectious and noninfectious tenosynovitis in \nboth the flexor and extensor wrist compartments [46].

In patients with persistent symptoms thought to be due to an occult wrist \nfracture, MRI can be used as an alternative to presumptive casting and repeat radiographs [ 12].

The expected sensitivity and specificity of US \nvaries depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the \nmeasurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary \nexamination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel \nsyndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal \ntunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, \nclinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of \ncarpal tunnel syndrome.

MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in cases in which this  \ninitial evaluation is equivocal. The MRI findings that have been reported in wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome \u2014\nincluding nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing\u2014may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value \nin patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68]. In rare cases of secondary carpal tunnel syndrome, MRI may identify \na mass lesion compressing the median nerve. There is some evidence that the length of T2 hyperintensity in the \nmedian nerve can help prognosticate the success of surgery [69] and that the shape and signal of the nerve predict \nclinical response to a steroid injection in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome [70 ].

The presence of \nsynovitis predicts progression of erosions [31 ] and erosions themselves [35]. US can also depict small bone \nerosions with high spatial resolution; h owever, US is less sensitive to erosions that occur on the radial or ulnar \nsides of the inner carpal bones because direct scanning of these regions is blocked, unlike the dorsal and volar \nbone surfaces.

Kransdorf, MD.n \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nIn patients with chronic wrist pain, imaging studies are  an important adjunct to history, physical examination, \nlaboratory testing, and electrophysiology studies. The choice of imaging modality depends on the patient\u2019s \npresentation and the clinical questions being asked. There are scenarios in which no imaging beyond baseline \nradiographs is necessary, but in other situations advanced imaging has added value for diagnostic eva luation and \ntreatment planning.  \nOverview of Imaging Modalities  \nRadiographs  \nImaging evaluation of the painful wrist should begin with radiog raphs [1,2]. This simple study may establish a \nspecific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, \nimpaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -\nanterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or \nmore oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling \n[3]. A v ariety of stress positions and maneuvers can be performed to elicit dynamic instability that is not visible \non standard radiographs [ 4]. Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. \nAdditionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ]. \nIn the past , fluoroscopic observation was used to establish the diagnosis of dynamic wrist inst ability. However, in \nmost practices,  fluoroscopy is used either for g uidance during wrist injections  or as an adjunct to arthrography.  \nPercutaneous aspiration of the wrist \u2014which is indicated in cases of suspected septic arthritis or to assess for intra-\narticular crystals\u2014can be carried out with either fluoroscopic or ultrasound (US) guidance  if needed . \nScintigraphy  \nBone scintigraphy has been used for diagnosing occult wrist fractures and as a screening procedure in patients \nwith wrist pain and negative radi ographs. However, while it is sensitive to bone abnormalities, scintigraphy \nsuffers from a lack of specificity [6 ].

In patients >70 years of age, a higher correlation with the \n\u201cabnormal\u201d knee being painful is present when structural abnormalities are unilateral on either radiographs or \nMRI.

Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and \nit can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain \nwith the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. \nTypically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain \npersists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  \nimaging study.

MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria\n\u00ae \ntopic on \u201c Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae \u201d [28]. \nSome patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using \nquantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs \nexhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ]. \nPatellofemoral car tilage loss is also associated with chronic knee pain , with active knee pain correlated with \nBMLs [30,31]. Similar to CT, MRI can calculate various anatomic measurements associated with patellofemoral \nsubluxation/dislocation and lateral patellofemoral friction syndrome [32-34]. Bone marrow edema in the classic \nlocation for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also \ndifferentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise \ntherapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. \nOther etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat \npad impingement syndromes, Hoffa\u2019s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome, adhesive \ncapsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes , \nand osteonecrosis [15, 19,36-45].  \nMRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a \njoint effusion. However, contrast -enhanced images ma y be more accurate in diagnosing other causes of chronic \nknee pain , such as Hoffa\u2019s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome, and adhesive \ncapsulitis [15].  In particular, enh ancing synovitis thicker than 2 mm in Hoffa\u2019s fat is correlated with peripatellar \npain [46]. Contrast -enhanced MRI is also useful in quantifying the degree of synovitis and in evaluating \nconditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis [ 17,42,47,48].  \nMR Arthrography  Knee  \nMR arthrography performed with an intra -articular injection of dilute gadolinium solution is typically not \nindicated as a second exam ination  but rather reserved for patients with known prior meniscal surgery, chondral \nand osteochondral lesions , and suspected loose bodies  [10].", "metadata": {"source": "ACR chronic knee pain.pdf", "page": "6"}}, {"page_content": "ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 8 Acute  Trauma  to the Knee  Variant  3: Adult  or skeletally  mature  child.

Along with a thorough history and physical  examination,  imaging  plays  a critical  role in determining the \nsource of chronic  shoul der pain.  Common pain generators in the shoulder  include  the rotator  cuff tendons,  biceps \ntendon,  labrum,  glenohumeral  articular  cartilage,  acromioclavicular  joint, bones,  suprascapular  and axillary  nerves,  \nand the joint capsule/synovium.  Imaging  can help to guide  appropriate  therapy , which  can range  from  conservative  \nmeasures such as physical  therapy  and cortico steroid  injections  to more  invasive  procedures  such as arthroscopy or \nsurgery . This document  focuses on the imaging approach  to patients  with suspected  chronic  mechanical  shoulder  \npain.

Isotropic  3-D imaging has been  increasingly  used as a substitute  for \nconventional  multiplanar  2-D MRI,  with a similar  sensitivity  and specificity  for rotator  cuff tear and labral  \nabnormalities  at a lower  scan time [7,8] . Faster  scans can also be performed  using 2-D fast spin echo  sequences  \nwith parallel  imaging , which  produce  similar  findings  as seen on conventional  MRI [9]. \nInitial Imaging  Definition \nInitial imaging  is defined  as imaging  at the beginning of the care episode for the medical  condition defined  by the \nvariant.

Indirect  MR arthrography has been  shown  to have  a slightly  higher  specificity  for diagnosing articular -\nsurface partial thickness tears  of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus  tendons,  as well as a greater  specificity  for \ndiagnosing subscapularis tendon tears [35], relative  to noncontrast  MRI,  and has shown  high accuracy  relative  to \narthroscopy [36]. Although the accuracy  of indirect  MR arthrography has been  descr ibed in the literature, it is not \ncommonly used in clinical  practice.  \nMRI Shoulder  Without  IV Contrast  \nMRI of the shoulder  is a highly  accurate tool in the assessment  of the rotator  cuff. MRI findings  of tendinopathy  \nconsist  of intermediate increased  signal  and tendon thickening [28]. Rotator  cuff tears,  particularly  full thickness  \ntears,  can be reliably  identified  using conventional  MRI  with high sensitivity  and specificity  [37-39]. Sensitivity  \nand specificity  for detecting  partial  thickness bursal  surface  tears is similar  for conventional  MRI and MR \narthrography  [27]. Although MR arthrography may have  a slightly  higher  sensitivity  and specificity  than \nconventional  MRI for diagnosing  rotator  cuff tears,  particularly  partial  thickness articular  surface tears,  this \ndifference in accuracy  must  be weighed  against  the need  for an invasive  arthrogram  procedure  [29]. Tendon \nretraction,  muscle atrophy,  and fatty infiltration  are associated  important  findings  that are well seen on MRI  and \npredict  reparability  of rotator  cuff tear [40]. Axial  images  can be helpful  in determining  rotator  cuff tear shape  [41], \nwhich  can aid in the selection  of a particular  surgical  technique.  In addition  to evaluating  the rotator  cuff itself , MRI  \ncan detect  extra-articular  abnormalities  that may predispose  to shoulder  impingemen t such as acromioclavicular  \ndegenerative change  or a subacromial  spur. Fluid  accumul ation  within  the subacromial  subdeltoid  bursa  is \nvisualized  on MRI and is often  a nonspecific finding  seen with a rotator  cuff tear or an underlying  inflammatory  \ndisorder  [42]. \nRadiography Shoulder  Additional Views  \nThe rotator  cuff tendons  cannot  be directly  assessed  radiographically,  regardless of the view.  Secondary  findings  of \nrotator  cuff tear such as a high-riding  humeral  head  or changes at the greater  tuberosity  can be seen on standard  \nradiographic  views.  There have  been  several  reports  assessing  special  views for the evaluation  of potential  \nimpingement  from  the anterior  acromion.  Outlet  views  can be used to determine acromial  shape  and have  been  \nshown  to be more  accurate than a single -slice MRI [43]. The Rockwood  and cassette tilt views  are angled  frontal  \nprojection s that can be used to detect  anterior  acromial  osteophyte s [44]. The subacromial  subdeltoid bursa  is a soft-\ntissue potential space and is not directly  visualized  on radiographs.  There is a peribursal  fat plane  between  the \nrotator  cuff tendons  and the deltoid  muscle;  however , obliteration  of the peribursal  fat stripe  is not a specific  \nindicator  of shoulder  pathology and may be seen in normal  subjects [42].", "metadata": {"source": "ACR chronic shoulder pain.pdf", "page": "8"}}, {"page_content": "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 15 Chronic Shoulder Pain  Radiography Shoulder  Additional Views  \nGlenohumeral  osteoarthritis  is typically  well visualized  on conventional  radiographic  views,  without  the need  for \nspecial  views.

Approximately  370,000 primary  total hip arthroplasties (THAs)  were performed  in the United  States in 2014  \n[2]. Sloan  et al [2] estimated  that the volume of primary  THAs  would  increase to 635,000 procedure s annually by \n2030.  \nOver  the years,  modifications  have  been  made  to attempt  to decrease  complications  such as loosening and wear  \nwith additional  fixation  techniques  (eg, osseointegration ) and articular  surfaces  (eg, metal  on highly  cross -linked  \npolyethylene , antioxidant  doped polyethylene  liners,  metal -on-metal  [MoM], ceramic on polyethylene , and ceramic  \non ceramic articulations)  [3-5]. \nSecond -generation  MoM prostheses were introduced in the late 1990s  [6]. These  prostheses were preferentially  \nused for younger  patients  with osteoarthritis  [7]. However , reports  of high short -term  failure  rates led to recalls  and \ndecreased  use [8,9] . These articulations  (and also metal  to metal  articulations  at the head  neck  [trunnion] and neck  \nstem  articulation s of modular  components)  may result  in the release of metal  particles and metal  ions leading  to \nmacroscopic necrosis,  osteolysis,  large sterile  hip effusions,  and periprosthetic  solid  and cystic masses termed  \n\u201cpseudotumors\u201d  [10]. The umbrella  terms  adverse local  tissue reaction  (ALTR ) and adverse reaction  to metal  debris  \n(ARMD ) have been  used to refer  to the spectrum  of findings  in failed  metal  on metal  articulations  [11-13]. The \nterm metallosis  refers  to infiltration  of metallic  wear  debris  into periprosthetic  structures [14]. \nThe most  common  causes  for surgical  revision  of THA  from 2012 to 2019 as reported  in the American  Academy  \nof Orthopaedic  Surgeons  American  Joint  Replacement  Registry  were infection  and inflammatory  reaction  (19.3%),  \ninstability  (17.4%),  and aseptic loosening (15.8% ) [15-17].

Kransdorf,  MD.o  \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nFractures of the proximal femur (commonly referred to as hip fractures)  are a frequent  source of morbidity and \nmortality in elderly osteoporotic patients [1]. Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type \nresult in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men \n[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs \nwill continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of \nlife following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays \nin diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -\nand long-term mortality [6-13]. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of hip fractures is critical. Hip fractures \ncannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded on the basis of physical exam ination  alone ; therefore , imaging plays a \nkey role in early  and accurate diagnosis [14] . \nThe biomechanics of proximal femoral and pelvic fractures that are a result of major trauma differs as these \ninjuries may be seen in any age group, often with additional accompanying high-velocity injuri es of the abdomen \nand pelvis . Motor vehicle \u2013related trauma is the most common  mechanism. Thorough evaluation of the hip may be \nsuperseded  in these instances by the need for resuscitation and diagnosis and treatment of more urgent associated \nvascular or solid organ injuries. Imaging plays an important role not only in the diagnosis of high-velocity \nfractures but also in characterizing fracture mechanism and morphology for treatment planning purposes.  \nHowever, imaging of high-velocity hip fractures occurs in the context of a broader trauma evaluation. A full \ndiscussion of the broader imaging workup of blunt trauma is beyond the scope of this paper and will be covered in \nthe upcoming ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae titled \u201cMajor Blunt Trauma\u201d and will be made available on the \nACR website  when completed . \nTreatment  for both intra - and extracapsular proximal femoral fractures in the elderly is typically surgical fixation  \nbecause of the risk of further fracture displacement and the dangers of prolonged immobilization in the elderly \n[15]. Joint replacement may be  performed for displaced fractures of the femoral neck where the risk of femoral \nhead avascular necrosis is high. Fractures from high -force trauma are also commonly treated with surgical \nfixation for stability to reduce the risk of post -traumatic osteo arthritis. \nDiscussion of Procedures by Variant  \nVariant 1:  Acute hip pain. Fall or minor trauma. Suspect fracture. Initial imaging.  \nRadiography Hip \nRadiography is the initial imaging modality of choice for assessment of acute hip pain with suspected fracture , \nwith the more advanced imaging modalities reserved for instances of clinically suspected fracture in the setting of \nnegative or equivocal radiographs. Radiographs are rapidly obtained and well tolerated by patients.

Osteolysis is a leading  cause of late TKA revision.  \nOsteolysis,  also known  as particle  disease and aggressive granulomatosis,  occurs secondary  to macrophage  \nphagocytosis  of particle  debris.  Debris originating  from  polyethylene,  cement,  and metal  can all be causes of cell-\nmediated  inflammatory  response  and osteolysis [113] , but typically  polyethylene  is the most  common  cause.  Areas \nof osteolysis contain  granulation  tissue with phagocytosed particulate  debris  [21]. The incidence of osteolysis is \nhigher  for cementless,  compared  with cemented  TKA  [114] . Osteolysis can occur  anywhere  but is more  common  \nin the region  of the femoral  condyles  near the attachment  of the collateral  ligaments,  along the periphery  of the \ncomponent,  and along  the access channels to the cancellous bone  of the tibia, including  screw holes  [114,115] . \nPatients  with osteolysis may be asymptomatic early  on but can go on to develop  pain,  swelling,  and acute synovitis.  \nAlthough small  areas of osteolysis  may be monitored,  the presence of large areas  of osteolysis suggest  component  \nloosening and may require  revision  surgery  [116] . Imaging can also help evaluate available bone  stock  in \npreparation  for revision  surgery.  Instability  refers  to abnormal  and excessive displacement  of the articular  surfaces  \nof the prosthesis  [21]. Instabil ity usually  occurs because of surgical  error and/or  poor prosthesis selection  and often  \nresults in revision  surgery  an average of 4 years after the primary  arthroplasty  [21]. Severe instability  can result  in \ndislocation. In a 2014 review of 781 cases of prosthesis failure,  Sharkey  et al [12] found that instability  represented  \nthe third  most  common  cause of prosthesis failure  overall,  accounting  for 7.5%  of all cases.  The concepts of \ninstability, malalignment, and loosening in TKA are closely  interrelated  [117] . When  malalignme nt of the joint is \ncreated  at the time of surgery,  minor  degrees of instability  can become a significant  problem.  By the same  token,  \ninstability, ongoing over time, can give rise to malalignment, which,  in turn, can lead to loosening.  Although \nligamentous  balance/imbalance plays  a role in joint instability, it is not the only factor  accounting for stability  [118] . \n3-Phase  Bone  Scan  Knee  \nThere is insufficient  evidence to support  routine  use of Tc-99m  3-phase bone  scans for the assessment  of instability.  \nBone  scintigraphy may be helpful  in diagnosing loosening,  especially  when  obtained many  years after surgery  [62]. \nThis delay  in maximum utility  is because of  the observation that positive  bone  scans are noted in 20% of \nasymptomatic knees 1 year after surge ry and in 12.5%  of individuals  2 years after surgery [61] . Serial  bone  scans \nmay be more  helpful  than a single  examination  [119] . Generally,  increased  uptake  on the delayed  images  but not \non the blood- pool phase is thought  to be due to loosening rather  than to infection  [60]. Normal  scans are most  \nhelpful  and are characterized  by a high NPV,  indicating  that loosening or infection  is unlikely.  A potential false  \nnegative ; however,  may occur  if there is loosening at the cement \u2013prosthetic  interface that does not incite  new bone  \nformation  [66].", "metadata": {"source": "ACR imaging after total knee arthroplasty.pdf", "page": "12"}}, {"page_content": "ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 15 Imaging  After  Total  Knee  Arthroplasty  on fracture  classification,  which  often  includes  information  regarding fracture  location, degree of comminution,  and \npositio n and stability  of the prosthesis.  \n3-Phase  Bone  Scan  Knee  \nRadionuclide  3-phase bone  scans can demonstrate  increased  activity  at a site of periprosthetic  fracture  and can show  \nfractures that are radiographically occult  [137, 138].

Beaman, MD.k \nSummary  of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nTotal knee  arthroplasty  (TKA),  primarily  used to treat pain and improve  function in patients with symptomatic  \nadvanced  knee  osteoarthritis, is the most  commonly performed  joint replacement  procedure  in the United  States  \n[1,2] . In 2012,  >670,000 knee  replacement  procedures  were performed  in the United  States  [3], which  represents \nan increase of 86% since 2003  [4]. It is estimated  that 4 million  patients  in the United  States  are currently  living  \nwith a knee  replacement  [5]. By 2030,  it is estimated  that the annual  demand  for primary  TKA  will grow  by 673%  \nto 3.48 million  [6]. Factors contributing  to the rising  number  of TKAs include  population growth;  aging  and \nincreased  longevity of the population;  expanded indications  for performing  TKA,  especially  in individuals  >65 \nyears of age; obesity;  decline in postprocedure  complications;  and increased  patient  demand  [7]. \nThe patient  satisfaction  rate for TKA is relatively  high,  ranging  from  75% to 89% [8]. Around  10% to 30% of the \npatients  report  ongoing pain or are not satisfied  with the result  [9]. Factors,  which  contribute  to patient  \ndissatisfaction , include  unmet  expectations,  functional  limitations,  and postoperative  complications  including pain \n[10]. Most  TKA  patients  expe rience improved outcomes  and long implant survival,  with long-term  TKA failure  \nrates of <1% per year [5]. The growth in the number  of primary  TKA  procedures  has been  accompanied  by increased  \nrates of TKA revision  procedures  [1]. Revision  procedures  for TKAs have  increased  by 5.4 procedures  per 100,000  \npersons  per decade over the period from  1990  to 2002,  with a mean  revision  burden of 8.2%  [11]. Nearly  1.5 million  \nof those  with primary  knee  replacement  are 50 to 69 years  of age, underscoring a large population at risk for revision  \nsurgery  and long-term  complications  [5]. Sharkey  et al [12] reviewed  781 revision  TKAs and found  the most  \ncommon  failure  mechanisms  were  loosening (39.9%),  infection  (27.4%),  instability  (7.5%),  periprosthetic  fracture  \n(4.7%),  and arthrofibrosis  (4.5%) . Infection  was the most  common  reason  for early  revision  (<2 years after the \ninitial TKA) , and aseptic loosening was the most  common  reason  for late revision.  Compared  with a review  \nperformed  by the same  author  in 2002 [13], polyethylene  wear  is no longer  the major  cause  of failure , and the \npercentages of revisions  for polyethylene  wear,  instability, arthrofibrosis,  malalignment,  and extensor  mechanism  \ndeficiency  have  all decreased.", "metadata": {"source": "ACR imaging after total knee arthroplasty.pdf", "page": "4"}}], "appropriateness": "USUALLY APPROPRIATE", "recommendation": "MRI knee without IV contrast"}, {"question": "Patient Profile: 74 year old Indian female.

The frequency  \nof infection  is increasing  as the number  of primary  arthroplasties increases [44]. Infection  may be acute  or delayed , \nwith delayed  infection  defined  as occurring at least 3 months  postoperatively  [45]. In a series,  infection  was \nresponsible  for 37.6%  of early  revisions  and 21.9%  of revisions  performed  >2 years after the initial operation [12]. \nStaphylococcus  aureus  and coagulase-negative  Staphylococcus  species,  including  Staphylococcus  epidermidis,  are \nthe most  common organisms  associated  with these infections  [46]. Both  clinical  findings  and laboratory tests may \nserve useful  in addition  to imaging  studies.  Low-grade  or chronic  TKA  infections  may be difficult to diagnose  \npreoperatively.  Duff  et al [18] noted that diagnosis  of infection  was not obvious  in 53% of knees before  revision  \narthroplasty.  Pain is the most  common  presenting  symptom  of infection, but pain is a nonspecific finding [47]. In \nacute infection,  findings  such as pain,  swelling,  warmth,  erythema,  and fever  are common,  whereas chronic  \ninfections  may be manifested  by pain alone  [44]. Night  pain or pain at rest is characteristic of infection, whereas  \npain on weightbearing  is more  characteristic of mechanical  loosening.  Some  authors  suggest  that infection  needs to \nbe excluded  in all patients  with pain persisting  >6 months  after joint replacement  [18]. \nLaboratory findings  in the setting  of TKA infection  are often  nonspecific.  Peripheral  leukocyte  counts  are not \nelevated  in most  patients  with infected  prostheses.  Erythrocyte  sedimentation  rates (ESRs) are abnormal  in patients  \nwith infection, but this finding  may also be seen in uninfected  patients,  limiting  the usefulness of the test [48]. A \nretrospective review of 68 patients  undergoing hip and knee  revision  surgery  indicated  that C-reactive protein  (CRP)  \nwas significantly  higher  in patients  with infection  compared  with those  with loosening (sensitivity  of 79% for all \nprostheses) ; however , a normal  CRP  level  did not exclude  infection  [49].", "metadata": {"source": "ACR imaging after total knee arthroplasty.pdf", "page": "7"}}, {"page_content": "CRP  has a sensitivity  of 73% to 91% and \na specificity  of 81% to 86% for the diagnosis  of prosthetic  knee  infection  when  a cutoff  of \u226513.5 mg/L  is used [44]. \nAlthough CRP  can be elevated  after surgery,  under  normal  circumstances  it generally  returns  to baseline within  2 \nmonths  [44]. A large multicenter  study found CRP  and joint aspiration  to be the most  useful  tools  to diagnose  \ninfection  [50]. In an attempt  to construct  an algorithm  for evaluating  TKA infection,  Savarino  et al [51] found that \nabnormal  results  for at least 2 of 3 tests (CRP  [cutoff  0.93 mg/L],  ESR [cutoff 27 mm/h],  and fibrinogen  [cutoff  \n432 mg/dL])  led to accurate results for the diagnosis  of infection  (sensitivity, 93%;  specificity,  100%;  accuracy,  \n97%) . More  recently,  interle ukin-6  has also shown  promise  for diagnosing  infection , with higher  predictive  values \nthan most  other  serologic  markers [52], and has shown  excellent  sensitivity  for detecting  infection  after TKA when  \ncombined with CRP  [53]. The American  Academy  of Orthopaedi c Surgeons  (AAOS ) guidelines  strongly  \nrecommend  the use of ESR, CRP , and serum  interleukin -6 testing  for patients  being assessed  for periprosthetic  joint \ninfection  [54]. Serologic  tests can be hard to interpret  when  underlying inflamm atory  arthropathy is present  [28]. \nMore  recently,  the use of an alpha -defensin  laboratory  test has been  described  for the diagnosis  of periprosthetic  \njoint infection.

Local  recurrence  rates  of bone  sarcomas  are reported  to be approximately  10% to 15% \nin patients  with osteosarcoma  and Ewing  sarcoma  [58-61].

In a \npatient  suspected  of having cancer,  MRI without  and with IV contrast  is considered  superior  in evaluation  of \nlocalizing  disease (intramedullary, intradural -extramedullary,  and extradural)  as well as assessing  extent  of the \nlesion.  For malignant/metastatic  disease,  both bony/marrow  involvement  and neural  compression  from  epidural  \ntumor  are visualized  with high spatial  resolution  [62]. Although CT lumbar  spine  without  IV contrast  can be \nperformed  to evaluate osseous  integrity  (eg, pathologic  fracture)  when  involved with tumor,  intradural  and spinal  \ncord pathologies  are poorly  depicted  on CT. Bone  scan remains invaluable  when  a survey  of the entire  skeleton  is \nindicated  (eg, for metastatic disease) ; however , MRI offers  greater  specificity  than bone  scan,  with comparable  \nsensitivity  and the added  advantage  of providing  anatomic detail  [63]. Although  osseous destruction , as well as \nidentifying  lytic or sclerotic lesions can be detected  on radiography,  at least half of the bone must  be eroded  before  \nthere is a noticeable change on radiographs  [64]. Whole -body  FDG-PET/CT  is typically  not an initial imaging  study  \nbut can be used to evaluate for widespread  metastatic disease and can distinguish  benign versus malignant  \ncompression  fractures [65,66] . \nIn a patient  with suspected  spinal  infection, MRI without  and with IV contrast  is preferred  because of its  high \nsensitivity  and specificity.  MRI can localize the site of infection  and assess the extent  of extradural/epidural  and \nparavertebral  involvement.  The addition  of IV contrast  with fat suppression  is invaluable  in identifying  epidural  \nand paraspinal  abscess [65] and helps  distinguish  abscess from  phlegmon [67].

Kransdorf, MD.q \nSummary of Literature Review  \nBackground/Introduction \nChronic knee pain affects tens of millions of people  in the United States annually , with the pain sometimes highly \ndisabling and often negatively impacting the patient\u2019s quality of life. Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and \nit can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain \nwith the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. \nTypically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain \npersists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  \nimaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated \nthat approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the \nprior year) radiographs [2 ]. \nThis document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  \u22655 years of age.  The \nvariants discussed include: (1) initial exam ination ; (2) initial radiograph is normal or demonstrates a joint \neffusion; (3) initial radiogr aph demonstrates osteochondritis dissecans (OCD), loose bodies or history of cartilage,  \nor meniscal repair; (4) initial radiograph demonstrates osteoarthritis or chondrocalcinosis; and (5)  initial \nradiograph demonstrates signs of prior (chronic) knee injur y (ie, Segond fract ure, tibial spine avulsion, etc ).  \nTo evaluat e knee pain associated with other conditions, please refer to the following ACR Appropriateness \nCriteria\u00ae topic on:  \u201cOsteonecrosi s of the Hip \u201d [3] for osteonecrosis,  \u201cAcute Trauma to the Knee \u201d for acute knee \ninjuries  [4], \u201cImaging After Total Knee Arthroplasty \u201d for patients with total knee arthroplasty  [5], \u201cSoft-Tissue \nMasses \u201d for a patient with a suspected soft -tissue mass [6], \u201cPrimary Bone Tumors \u201d for a patient with a suspected \nor known bone tumor [ 7], and \u201c Chronic Extremity Joint Pain -Suspected Inflammatory Arthritis \u201d for patient with \nsuspected arthritis  or synovitis [ 8]. \nSpecial Imaging  Considerations  \nKnee radiographs  should include at least one frontal projection of one or both knees (anteroposterior, Rosenberg, \nor tunnel), a tangential patellar view , and a lateral view of the affected knee [2,9].

MRI can \nassess the integrity of the medial patellofemoral ligament and medial patellar retinaculum, define the extent of \ncartilage injury, and identify loose bodies [41].  MRI is useful for evaluating Osgood-Schlatter or Sinding -Larsen -\nJohansson syndrome [41].  If the radiograph suggests prior anterior cruciate ligament  injury, MRI can effectively \nevaluate the menisci , but evaluation for associated cartilage lesions is less useful [65].  \nMRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) \nosseous knee injury.  \nMR Arthrography  Knee  \nMR arthrography is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with s igns of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  \nUS Knee  \nUS is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  \nBone Scan Knee  \nRadionuclide bone scan is usually not indicated to evaluate patients with signs of prior  (chronic) osseous knee \ninjury.  \nImage -Guided Aspiration Knee  \nJoint aspiration is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  \nSummary of Recommendations  \n\u2022 Variant 1:  Radiographs  of the knee  are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of  chronic knee pain in \npatients greater than or equal to 5 years of age.  \n\u2022 Variant 2:  MRI knee without  IV contrast is usually appropriate in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of \nage with chronic knee pain when initial knee  radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion.  \n\u2022 Variant 3:  MRI knee without  IV contrast is usually appropriate  in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of \nage with chronic knee pain when initial knee radiographs demonstrate OCD,  loose bodies, or history of \ncartilage or meniscal repair.  \n\u2022 Variant 4:  (1) MRI knee without IV contrast  or (2)  knee aspiration or (3)  CT knee without  IV contrast may \nbe appropriate  in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of age with chronic knee pain when initial \nradiographs de monstrate degenerative changes or chondrocalcinosis.

New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or \npatients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee \npain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the \norigin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. \nSubchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed \nspontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to \nelderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs \noften initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, \nand progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is \nsuspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria\n\u00ae \ntopic on \u201c Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae \u201d [28]. \nSome patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using \nquantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs \nexhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ]. \nPatellofemoral car tilage loss is also associated with chronic knee pain , with active knee pain correlated with \nBMLs [30,31]. Similar to CT, MRI can calculate various anatomic measurements associated with patellofemoral \nsubluxation/dislocation and lateral patellofemoral friction syndrome [32-34]. Bone marrow edema in the classic \nlocation for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also \ndifferentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise \ntherapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. \nOther etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat \npad impingement syndromes, Hoffa\u2019s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome, adhesive \ncapsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes , \nand osteonecrosis [15, 19,36-45].  \nMRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a \njoint effusion. However, contrast -enhanced images ma y be more accurate in diagnosing other causes of chronic \nknee pain , such as Hoffa\u2019s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome, and adhesive \ncapsulitis [15].  In particular, enh ancing synovitis thicker than 2 mm in Hoffa\u2019s fat is correlated with peripatellar \npain [46]. Contrast -enhanced MRI is also useful in quantifying the degree of synovitis and in evaluating \nconditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis [ 17,42,47,48].  \nMR Arthrography  Knee  \nMR arthrography performed with an intra -articular injection of dilute gadolinium solution is typically not \nindicated as a second exam ination  but rather reserved for patients with known prior meniscal surgery, chondral \nand osteochondral lesions , and suspected loose bodies  [10].", "metadata": {"source": "ACR chronic knee pain.pdf", "page": "6"}}], "appropriateness": "USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE", "recommendation": "NO SCAN REQUIRED"}, {"question": "Patient Profile: 17 year old Malay female.

Kransdorf, MD.p \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nTraumatic shoulder pain is shoulder pain believed to be directly attributed to a traumatic event, either acute or \nchronic. This pain may be the result of either fracture (the clavicle, scapula, or proximal humerus) or soft -tissue \ninjury (most commonly of the rotator cuff, acromioclavicular ligaments, or labroligamentous complex). The \nincidence of traumatic shoulder injuries is difficult to determine because some injury types, such as low-grade \nacromioclavicular separations or acute rotator cuff tears, are likely under -reported because patients  do not seek \nimmediate medical treatment. However, as with many traumatic injuries, traumatic shoulder pain tends to \ndisproportionately involve young adults and male patients [ 1,2]. \nThe etiology of traumatic shoulder pain can often be made based on clinical examination, radiographs, and \nmechanism of injury. Traumatic shoulder injuries can generally be separated into in juries requiring acute surgical \nmanagement and injuries in which conservative management can be attempted prior to considering surgical \ntreatment. Unstable or significantly displaced fractures and joint instability are injuries most likely requiring acute \nsurgical treatment. Most soft -tissue injuries (such as labral tears and rotator cuff tears) can undergo a period of \nconservative management prior to considering surgery. However, in addition to the specific imaging findings \nrelated to a traumatic injury, indications and timing of surgical treatment of many traumatic shoulder injuries are \ndependent on patient age, comorbidities, current activity level, and expected activity level.  \nImaging of chronic shoulder pain is beyond the scope of this topic  and is cove red in the  ACR Appropriateness \nCriteria\u00ae on \u201cShoulder Pain\u2013 Atraumatic \u201d [3]. \nDiscussion o f Procedures  by Variant  \nVariant 1:  Traumatic shoulder pain. Any etiology . Initial imaging . \nRadiography Shoulder  \nRadiographs are the preferred initial study performed in the setting of traumatic shoulder pain . They can delineate \nshoulder malalignment and most shoulder fractures [ 4,5]. A standard set of shoulder radiographs for trauma \nshould include at least three  views: anterior -posterior (AP) views in internal and external rotation and an axillary \nor scapula-Y view. Axillary or scapula-Y views are vital in evaluating traumatic shoulder injuries as \nacromioclavicular and glenohumeral dislocations can be misclassified on AP  views [6,7]. Radiographs provide \ngood delineation of bony anatomy to assess for fracture and appropriate shoulder alignment, which are the two \nprimary concerns in management of acute traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs should also be performed upright \nsince malalignment of the shoul der can be under -represented on supine radiographs [ 4]. Additional views, such as \nthe Bernageau view, have been sho wn to be effective in demonstrating the degree of bone loss of the glenoid or \nhumeral head [ 8]. \nCT Shoulder  \nComputed tomography ( CT) is better able than radiogr aphs to characteriz e fracture patterns [ 9-11].", "metadata": {"source": "ACR shoulder pain traumatic.pdf", "page": "6"}}, {"page_content": "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 8 Shoulder Pain \u2013Traumatic  Variant 2: Traumatic shoulder pain.

Next imaging \nstudy. \nAppropriately positioned  radiographs can exclude shoulder dislocation and most displaced fractures as the \netiology for post -traumatic shoulder pain. In the setting of normal shoulder radiographs, the most common causes \nof post -traumatic shoulder pain are soft -tissue injuries such  as rotator cuff and labral tears.  \nMRI Shoulder  \nNoncontrast MRI is a reasonable imaging study in the setting of acute nonlocalized traumatic shoulder pain and \nnoncontributory radiographs. In the acute trauma setting, noncontrast MRI may be preferred to MR arthrography , \nas acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint effusion for assessment of intra -articular \nsoft-tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic \npathology such as capsular and ligament tears [34,35]. MRI is also sensitive for diagnosing bone marrow \ncontusion and has  been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries in pediatric patients [ 36,37]. \nMR Arthrography  Shoulder  \nMR arthrography has been found to be superior to noncontrast MRI in the diagnosis of labroligamentous and \npartial -thickness rotator cuff tears [17,19]. In the acute trauma setting, however, noncontrast MRI may be \npreferred to MR arthrography because acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint \neffusion for assessment of intra-arti cular soft -tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing \nextra-articular soft -tissue traumatic pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [ 34,35]. MRI is also sensitive \nfor diagnosing bone marrow contusion and has been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries \nin pediatric patients [ 36,37]. \nUS Shoulder  \nUS has limited usefulness in patients with traumatic shoulder pain that cannot be localized to the rotator cuff or \nbiceps tendon. I n the post -traumatic setting, US has been shown to detect abnormalities, including proximal \nhumeral fractures [25]; however, recent studies on US performed for non specific shoulder pain have had \nconflicting results. US  for persistent shoulder pain after trauma has been found to diagnose significant pathology, \nprimarily fractures and rotator cuff tears, in 90% of patients [ 25]. However, 40% of patients presenting with \nnonspecific shoulder pain were found to have no significant pathology on US [38]. Additionally,  US has been \ndemonstrated to be inferior to MRI in assessment of labroligamentous, osseous, and rotator cuff pathology [ 17]. \nUS can b e considered as a screening tool in patients with persistent nonspecific shoulder pain after trauma, \nparticularly in an older patient population in whom rotator cuff tears are more common. However, a low threshold \nshould be maintained for performing additi onal imaging in the setting of a noncontributory shoulder US  \nexam ination . \nCT Shoulder  \nCT has virtually no usefulness in diagnosing common traumatic soft -tissue injuries such as rotator cuff tears, \nlabroligamentous injuries, and muscle tears. Although CT is  the gold standard for diagnosing and characterizing \nfractures, MRI has been shown to be equivalent to CT in diagnosing the nondisplaced fractures that are typically \nmissed on radiographs.  \nCT Arthrography  Shoulder  \nCT is inferior to MRI and US  in diagnosing virtually all extra -articular traumatic soft -tissues injuries. CT is \nconsidered the gold standard in identifying fractures . However, MRI has shown to be equivalent to CT in \nassessing bone loss [12,18], and MRI is usually adequate for diagnosing the nondisplaced fractures that are \ntypically missed on conventional radiographs. CT arthrography is able to reliably evaluat e for glenohumeral \ncartilage injury, SLAP tears, and labroligamentous injuries [ 12,39] but is generally considered inferior to MRI in \ndiagnosing  rotator cuff and soft -tissue Bankart lesions [ 12].", "metadata": {"source": "ACR shoulder pain traumatic.pdf", "page": "8"}}, {"page_content": "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 3 Shoulder Pain \u2013Traumatic  Variant 5 : Traumatic shoulder pain.

MRI has been shown to have similar performance to CT in the evaluation of Hill-Sachs \nlesions and glenoid bone loss [12,18]. MR arthrography has also been found to be reliable in diagnosi ng anterior \nshoulder instability and labroligamentous injuries [58,59]. MR arthrography has specifically o utperformed \nnoncontrast MRI in assessment of glenohumeral ligament and anterior labral injuries [ 17,19], which ar e \ncommonly seen in shoulder instability. MR arthrogr aphy has also outperformed noncontrast MRI in diagnosis of \nrotator cuff tears [17,19], which is a common associated finding in older patients with shoulder dislocation. \nHowever, high sensitivities reported for MR arthrography in the detection of labral pathology may not be \napplicable to patients with clinically unstable shoulders. A retrospective review of 90 patients with clinically \nunstable shoulders selected for arthroscopy [ 60] found that MR arthrography had a sensitivity of 65% for \ndetection of labral  tears. The authors proposed that this discrepancy with prior studies was the result of different \npatient selection criteria (clinically unstable in their study versus less-specific symptoms such as shoulder pain in \nothers) and the interpretation of MR art hrography by experienced musculoskeletal radiologists [ 60]. For this \ndocument, it is assumed the procedure is performed and interpreted by an expert.  \nMRI Shoulder  \nMRI without contrast may be pre ferred to MR arthrography in the setting of acute shoulder dislocation when a \npost-traumatic joint effusion is present to provide sufficient visualization of soft -tissue structures. In the subacute \nor chronic setting, the glenohumeral joint effusion is usually too small to provide adequate joint distention for \noptimal assessment  of soft -tissue structures. Non contrast MRI has been shown to be inferior to MR arthrography \nin diagnosing labroligamentous and rotator cuff injuries [17,19]. Non contrast MRI performs comparably to CT in \nevaluating glenoid and humeral head bone loss [ 12,18], which may obviate the need for noncontrast CT . \nCT Arthrography  Shoulder  \nCT arthrography is effective in evaluation of shoulder instability. CT arthrogr aphy is comparable to MR \narthrography in the diagnosis of Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions [12] , and moderate agreement has been found \nbetween readers for diagnosing ant erior capsule laxity on CT arthrography. However, CT arthrography has been \nshown to be inferior to MR arthrography in assessing partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [12], which makes CT \narthrography less desirable in older patients with dislocation/instability where rotator cuff tears are common. CT \narthrography may be considered in a patient with shoulder dislocation/instabili ty and contraindication to MRI.  \nCT Shoulder  \nNoncontrast CT has historically been performed to assess bone loss in patients with recurrent dislocation or \nchronic instability. However, recent studies have shown MRI to be equivalent to CT in assessment of glenoid and \nhumeral head bone loss [12,18], which places in question the need for noncontrast CT in the assessment of \nshoulder instability. Noncontrast CT is als o unable to assess rotator cuff and labroligamentous pathology \ncommonly seen in shoulder dislocations/instability. In general, CT should be reserved for patients with a \ncontraindication to MRI or patients in whom MRI assessment of bone loss is limited.  \nUS Shoulder  \nThere is no defined role for US  in the assessment of shoulder dislocation  or instability.

MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing \nextra-articular soft -tissue traumatic pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [ 34,35]. MRI is also sensitive \nfor diagnosing bone marrow contusion and has been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries \nin pediatric patients [ 36,37]. \nUS Shoulder  \nUS has limited usefulness in patients with traumatic shoulder pain that cannot be localized to the rotator cuff or \nbiceps tendon. I n the post -traumatic setting, US has been shown to detect abnormalities, including proximal \nhumeral fractures [25]; however, recent studies on US performed for non specific shoulder pain have had \nconflicting results. US  for persistent shoulder pain after trauma has been found to diagnose significant pathology, \nprimarily fractures and rotator cuff tears, in 90% of patients [ 25]. However, 40% of patients presenting with \nnonspecific shoulder pain were found to have no significant pathology on US [38]. Additionally,  US has been \ndemonstrated to be inferior to MRI in assessment of labroligamentous, osseous, and rotator cuff pathology [ 17]. \nUS can b e considered as a screening tool in patients with persistent nonspecific shoulder pain after trauma, \nparticularly in an older patient population in whom rotator cuff tears are more common. However, a low threshold \nshould be maintained for performing additi onal imaging in the setting of a noncontributory shoulder US  \nexam ination . \nCT Shoulder  \nCT has virtually no usefulness in diagnosing common traumatic soft -tissue injuries such as rotator cuff tears, \nlabroligamentous injuries, and muscle tears. Although CT is  the gold standard for diagnosing and characterizing \nfractures, MRI has been shown to be equivalent to CT in diagnosing the nondisplaced fractures that are typically \nmissed on radiographs.  \nCT Arthrography  Shoulder  \nCT is inferior to MRI and US  in diagnosing virtually all extra -articular traumatic soft -tissues injuries. CT is \nconsidered the gold standard in identifying fractures . However, MRI has shown to be equivalent to CT in \nassessing bone loss [12,18], and MRI is usually adequate for diagnosing the nondisplaced fractures that are \ntypically missed on conventional radiographs. CT arthrography is able to reliably evaluat e for glenohumeral \ncartilage injury, SLAP tears, and labroligamentous injuries [ 12,39] but is generally considered inferior to MRI in \ndiagnosing  rotator cuff and soft -tissue Bankart lesions [ 12].", "metadata": {"source": "ACR shoulder pain traumatic.pdf", "page": "8"}}, {"page_content": "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 6 Shoulder Pain \u2013Traumatic  SHOULDER PAIN\u2013 TRAUMATIC  \nExpert Panel on Musculoskelet al Imaging: Behrang Amini, MD, PhDa; Nicholas M.

Kransdorf, MD.p \nSummary of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nTraumatic shoulder pain is shoulder pain believed to be directly attributed to a traumatic event, either acute or \nchronic. This pain may be the result of either fracture (the clavicle, scapula, or proximal humerus) or soft -tissue \ninjury (most commonly of the rotator cuff, acromioclavicular ligaments, or labroligamentous complex). The \nincidence of traumatic shoulder injuries is difficult to determine because some injury types, such as low-grade \nacromioclavicular separations or acute rotator cuff tears, are likely under -reported because patients  do not seek \nimmediate medical treatment. However, as with many traumatic injuries, traumatic shoulder pain tends to \ndisproportionately involve young adults and male patients [ 1,2]. \nThe etiology of traumatic shoulder pain can often be made based on clinical examination, radiographs, and \nmechanism of injury. Traumatic shoulder injuries can generally be separated into in juries requiring acute surgical \nmanagement and injuries in which conservative management can be attempted prior to considering surgical \ntreatment. Unstable or significantly displaced fractures and joint instability are injuries most likely requiring acute \nsurgical treatment. Most soft -tissue injuries (such as labral tears and rotator cuff tears) can undergo a period of \nconservative management prior to considering surgery. However, in addition to the specific imaging findings \nrelated to a traumatic injury, indications and timing of surgical treatment of many traumatic shoulder injuries are \ndependent on patient age, comorbidities, current activity level, and expected activity level.  \nImaging of chronic shoulder pain is beyond the scope of this topic  and is cove red in the  ACR Appropriateness \nCriteria\u00ae on \u201cShoulder Pain\u2013 Atraumatic \u201d [3]. \nDiscussion o f Procedures  by Variant  \nVariant 1:  Traumatic shoulder pain. Any etiology . Initial imaging . \nRadiography Shoulder  \nRadiographs are the preferred initial study performed in the setting of traumatic shoulder pain . They can delineate \nshoulder malalignment and most shoulder fractures [ 4,5]. A standard set of shoulder radiographs for trauma \nshould include at least three  views: anterior -posterior (AP) views in internal and external rotation and an axillary \nor scapula-Y view. Axillary or scapula-Y views are vital in evaluating traumatic shoulder injuries as \nacromioclavicular and glenohumeral dislocations can be misclassified on AP  views [6,7]. Radiographs provide \ngood delineation of bony anatomy to assess for fracture and appropriate shoulder alignment, which are the two \nprimary concerns in management of acute traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs should also be performed upright \nsince malalignment of the shoul der can be under -represented on supine radiographs [ 4]. Additional views, such as \nthe Bernageau view, have been sho wn to be effective in demonstrating the degree of bone loss of the glenoid or \nhumeral head [ 8]. \nCT Shoulder  \nComputed tomography ( CT) is better able than radiogr aphs to characteriz e fracture patterns [ 9-11].", "metadata": {"source": "ACR shoulder pain traumatic.pdf", "page": "6"}}, {"page_content": "\u2022 Variant 6 : US or Image-guided anesthetic +/ - corticosteroid injection or MR arthrography or MRI without IV \ncontrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study in the evaluation of chronic shoulder pain when \nradiographs are normal or inconclusive  and biceps tendon abnormality is suspected.

In addition, radiographs  can be diagnostic  of an unsuspected  \nskeletal  abnormality  or deformity  that may manifest  as a soft tissue mass.  Even  when  a specific diagnosis  cannot  \nbe provided,  radiographs  may reveal  information  on the type and scope of mineralization, the presence or absence  \nof unsuspected  foreign  matter,  or changes  within  the adjacent  bone.  In general,  radiographic  findings  related  to a \nsoft tissue mass  can provide  helpful  insight  in determining  the next most  appropriate  imaging  modality  for further  \ncharacterization.  Of note,  radiographs  may not demonstrate an associated  abnormality  when  a mass  is small, deep -\nseated,  nonmineralized,  or in an area with complex  anatomy  such as the flank,  paraspinal  region,  groin,  or deep  soft \ntissues of the hands  and feet [11]. \nUS Area  of Interest  \nUltrasound  (US)  has become increasingly  recognized  as an excellent  triage  tool for evaluation  of superficial  soft \ntissue masses [12-15]. This recognition has been  further  supported by a recent  prospective  study of 219 \nhistologically  proven  masses that showed  US had a sensitivity, specificity, positive  predictive  value,  and negative  \npredictive  value  of 93.3%,  97.9%,  45.2%,  and 99.9%,  respectively , for discriminating  benign  from  malignant  \ntumors  in the superficial  soft tissues [16]. The same group  of researchers had similar  results in an earlier  separate  \nretrospective analysis of 247 histologically  proven  masses [17]. However,  although these results highlight  the \nbenefits of US in the initial assessment  of superficial  masses,  the overall  number  of malignancies in both the \nprospective  [16] and retrospective [17] studies was very small  (12 patients  and 11 patients,  respectively).

In the evaluation  of suspected  tumors,  contrast  imaging  is especially  useful  in \ndistinguishing vascularized  from  potentially  necrotic regions  of the tumor.  With  modern  CT technology,  \ncalcification  can usually  be distinguished from  vascular  enhancement.  \nOf note, d ual-energy  CT is a relatively  newer  technology that has shown  utility  in evaluation  of soft tissue masses.  \nUsing  the differences in energy  attenuation  of soft tissue at 80 kVp and 140 kVp,  this technique  can allow  \nreconstruction  of virtual noncontrast  CT images as well as significantly  reduce metal  artifact  in the assessment  of \nmetal  implants,  improving the diagnostic  value  of imaging  in the surrounding soft tissues [49,50] .

On initial diagnosis, MRI can be used to  predict t ime to return to play in athletes. \nFredericson et al  [48] retrospectively correlated return to activity with an MRI grading system based on the \npattern of periosteal and marrow edema on T1-weighted  and fat -suppressed T 2-weighted sequences. Similar \nfindings were confirmed in other studies  [49-51] , including  that the finding of abnormal cortical signal intensity \nor a fracture line was of prognostic value [ 51] and that MRI performed better in predicting return to activity than \nradiographs , bone scintigraphy, or CT [50,52]. \nA recent prospective study in university athletes found that MRI grading s everity, total-body bone mineral density \nevaluated by dual -energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and location of injury (ie , cortical or trabecular bone)  \nwere important variables for predicting time to full return to sport [ 31]. In this study, periosteal edema as \ndescribed by Fredericson et al [ 48] was not associated with return to sport . Using the modified grading scale and a \nmultiple regression model, for every 1- unit increase in MRI grade, the time to full return to sport increased by \napproximately 48 days [31] . Furthermore, trabecular st ress injuries (eg , femur neck and pubic bone ) were \nassociated with a longer time to return to sport than cortical bone stress injuries. In addition, decreased bone \nmineral density leads to increased time to return to sport . Therefore, bone mineral density provides additional \ndiagnostic and prognostic information [31]. The model of MRI  grade, trabecular versus cortical bone sit e, and \ntotal-body bone mineral density a ccounted for 68% of the variation in time to return to sport [ 31]. Although \nfurther studies are needed, optimization of bone mass may reduce risk of sustaining str ess injuries or possibly \nreduce recovery time i n athletes with these injuries.  \nIt should be noted that after a diagnosis of stress fracture is made, no additional imaging is typically performed. \nPatients are typically followed clinically until they are pain  free, at which time they can  increase activity in a \ncontrolled manner  [53]. \nVariant 6 : Suspected stress (in sufficiency) fracture , pelvis or hip. First imaging study.  \nSee variant 1.  Pelvic and hip insufficiency fractures have varied presentations and often insidious onset. Patients \nfrequently present with intractable lower back or pelvic pain, with loss of mobil ity and independence  and \nsymptom exacerbation with weight bearing [54]. Insufficiency fractures occur in patients with abnormal bone , be \nit from osteoporosis, irradiated bone, or resumpt ion of activity postarthropl asty as typical examples. Insufficiency \nfractures also occur at fairly predictable sites, including the sacrum , supra -acetabular ilium, superior and inferior \npubic rami,  and pubic bone . Radiographs should be the initial imaging modality in patients with low back and/or \npelvic pain. Anterior -posterior ( AP) and lateral lumbar spine and AP pelvis radiographs are usually obtained. \nBecause of  overlying bowel gas, fecal material, vascular calcifications, sacral curvature, and/or copious soft \ntissue, the sensitivity of radiographs is low  [55]. Radiographs may be more likely to be negative initially in older \nor osteoporotic patients with insuffi ciency fractures, particularly when they occur in the pelvis or sacrum  where \nthere is more overlapping soft tissue [ 17]. However, if the findings are conclusive for insufficiency fracture, no \nfurther imaging need be performed.  \nVariant 7 : Suspected stress (insufficiency) fracture, pelvis or hip.

Detection of osseous change is more limited in areas covered by prominent overlapping soft tissue [17]. If the \nosseous reaction involve s cortical bone, then endosteal/periosteal callus may be visible with or without a fracture \nline through the cortex. If the trabecular bone is involved, then stress fractures are often more  subtle, progressing \nfrom patchy areas of increased density into linear areas of sclerosis, oriented perpendicular to the trabeculae.  \nAlthough bone scans were regarded as the gold-standard examination for many years, MRI is extremely sensitive \nand demonstrates stress abnormalities as early as bone scintigraphy  and with as much sensitivity  [11-14] . The \nrecent literature favors MRI as the procedure of choice for making an early diagnosis of both varieties of stress \nfractures [15-28]. In this regard, MRI outperforms radiography,  bone scintigraphy, and CT. Furthermore, MRI \nexamination of an osseous stress injury contains  prognostic as well as diagnostic information  [30,31]. \nCT is not typically used as a first - or second -line imaging tool  but may offer an adjunctive role when other \nimaging modalities are equivocal  [23]. Although  superior to radiography, it is less sensitive than nuclear \nscintigraphy and MRI  [19]. \nStress fractures in the femur most often occur in the femoral neck and represent up to 7% of all stress fractures  \n[39]. Lateral \u201ctension -type \u201d femoral neck stress fractures are inherently unstable and prone to displacement  [40] \nand are high-risk fractures, often necessitating percutaneous screw fixation  [41]. Medial \u201ccompression -type \u201d \nfemoral n eck stress fractures are low risk [40] and can be treated with a non\u2013 weight -bearing  regimen  [42]. \nFinally, stress fractures of the femoral head are high  risk in healthy patients and , if not recognized promptly, have \nincreased  rates of delayed union, nonunion, displacement, and avascular necrosis [17]. Given the importance of \nrecognizing these high-risk fractures in the femoral head and neck, MRI is the preferred second -line study after  \ninitial negative  radiographs to prevent delayed diagnosis.  \nVariant 3: Suspected stress (fatigue) fracture, excluding hip  and vertebrae. Negative radiographs. Next \nimaging study.  \nSee variant 2. Certain stress fractures are considered high  risk based on a tendency for nonunion or delayed union. \nHigh -risk stress fractures include the anterior tibial diaphysis, lateral femoral neck and femoral head (see variant \n2), patella, medial malleolus, navicular, fifth metatarsal base, proximal second metatarsal, tibial hallux sesamoid, \nand talus  [43]. \nThe second -line test to diagnose a stress fracture should be guided by the location of the patient \u2019s pain and \nlikelihood of high-risk injury. A follow -up radiographic examination has increased sensitivity compared to initial \nradiographs [8] but is less sensitive than MRI. MRI is extremely sensitive and demonstrates stress abnormalities \nas early as bone scintigraphy and with as much sensitivity [ 11-14]. The recent literature favors MRI as the \nprocedure of choice for making an early diagnosis of both varieties of stress fractures [ 15-28 ]. MRI is also \nconsiderably more specifi c than bone scintigraphy [ 19,23]. Stress injuries in athletes that are not identified and \nmanaged in a timel y fashion can progress to more serious fractures. Preventive strategies, including identifying \nand modifying risk factors, may help deter progression to frank fractures [31,44,45]. \nA circumstance that deserves specific attention is the longitudinal stress fracture, particularly in the tibia. Up to \n25% may appear n ormal on radiographs, but CT or MRI findings are characteristic [ 13,46]. MRI is very sensitive \nto the bone marrow e dema accompanying these longitudinal fractures and may give a misleadingly aggressive \nappearance [38].", "metadata": {"source": "ACR stress fracture including sacrum.pdf", "page": "9"}}, {"page_content": "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 8 Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture  tomography (SPECT) is more accurate in diagnosing stress injuries than planar scintigraphy alone [ 10]. The \nobjecti on to the studies quoting high accuracy for bone scintigraphy is that in all of them, positive bone \nscintigraphy is taken as the gold standard for detecting stress fractures and therefore sensitivity is 100%. \nHowever, depending on the staging criteria for bone scintigraphy pattern, the abnormalities may in fact be stress \nreactions rather than actual stress fractures [4,5,7]. Nonetheless, it is clear that bone scintigraphy shows stress \nfractures days to weeks earlier than radiographs in many instances and differentiates between osseous and soft -\ntissue injury as well.  \nMagnetic resonance imaging  \nMRI is extremely sensitive and demonstrates stress abnormalities as early as bone scintigraphy and with as much \nsensitivity [11-14] . The recent literature favors MRI as the procedure of choice for making an early diagnosis of \nboth varieties of stress fractures [15-28 ]. In this regard, MRI out performs radiography, bone scintigraphy, and \ncomputed tomography (CT). Fluid-sensitive sequences are the favored initial sequence for MRI screening [ 29]. \nWith a small field of view, short tau inversion recovery and/or T1-weighted imaging will usually demonstrate a \nfracture line surrounded by edema. In the absence of an actual stress fracture, stress reaction or muscle/tendon \ninjuries can be identified using fluid -sensitive sequences. Thus, MRI may be as sensitive as bone scintigraphy  but \nalso considerably more specific [19,23]. Intravenous contrast is not needed for diagnosis and has yet to provide \nany additional information.  MRI examination of an osseous stress injury contains prognostic as well as diagnostic \ninformation [30,31]. \nComputed tomography  \nCT is not typically used as a first - or second -line imaging tool in the workup of stress fractures  but may offer an \nadjunct role when other im aging modalities are equivocal [ 23], particularly in the pelvis or sacrum . Although  \nsuperior to radiography, it is less sensitive than nu clear scintigraphy or MRI [19]. The benefit of CT seems to lie \nin its specificity, ranging from 88%  to 98% in a recent meta-analysis looking at diagnostic accuracy of imaging \nmodalities for lower -extremity stress fractures, and thus may confirm a suspected stress fracture based on MRI  \n[32]. However, CT does involve ionizing radiation, so it is typically used only when MRI is equivocal.  For the \nevaluation of stress fractures, intravenous contrast is not helpful as a part of CT examinations.  \nUltrasound  \nThere is limited evidence on the u tility of ultrasound in diagnosing stress fractures. Ultrasound is a first -line \nimaging modality in assessing muscles, tendons, joints, and nerves in the extremities  [33], so the radiologist \nshould know the typical sono graphic appearance of stress fractures. S onographic findings of s tress fractures \ninclude  subcutaneous edema , periosteal thickening, cortical bone irregularity, local hyperemia  [33-35 ], and \nperiosteal callus.  Overall, ultrasound appears to be more sensitive than specif ic [32], and similar ultrasound \nfindings can be seen in osteomyelitis or neoplasm. Furthermore, ultrasound cannot evalua te the subcortical bone, \nso trabecular stress fractures may be missed. Although touted as cheap and quick to perform , it is limited a s an \noperator -dependent modality.  \nVariant 1: S uspected stress (fatigue) fracture,  excluding vertebrae.

Diabetes-related  foot \ncomplications , such as soft-tissue infection, osteomyelitis , and neuropathic  osteoarthropathy,  account  for up to \n20% of all diabetic -related  North  American  hospital  admissions,  with up to $1.5 billion  spent  annually in the \nUnited  States  on diabetic  foot ulcer  care [2]. \nNeuropathic  changes in the foot are present  in about  1% of diabetics [3]. Neuropathic  osteoarthropathy  is a \nprogressive  process affecting  the bones,  joints , and soft tissue of the foot and ankle.  Delay  in the diagnosis  may \nlead to derangement  of the bony architecture of the foot, deformity,  recurrent  foot ulcerations,  cellulitis,  \nosteomyelitis , and amputation [4]. \nImaging findings  should not be interpreted  in isolation. Clinical  features that suggest  osteomyelitis  include  an \nulcer  area >2 cm\u00b2, an elevated  erythrocyte  sedimentation  rate level  of >70 mm/hour,  positive probe -to-bone  test, a \nnonhealing  ulcer  for 6 months,  erythema,  fever,  and elevated  white blood cell (WBC) count  [2,5,6]. A negative  \nprobe -to-bone  test may exclude  the diagnosis  of osteomyelitis  with a high negative  predictive  value  [7]. The \nInfectious  Diseases Society  of American  recommends performing  the probe -to-bone  test on any diabetic  foot \ninfection  with an open wound [8]. Deep  wound cultures correlate well with osseous cultures and provide  a \nsensitive method in assessing  and targeting  likely  pathogens  that cause osseous infections  [9]. \nFor the diabetic  foot with a clinical  examination  suggesting crepitus where soft-tissue gas associated  with wet \ngangrene  is suspected,  please see the ACR  Appropria teness  Criteria\u00ae topic  on Suspected  Osteomyelitis,  Septic  \nArthritis, or Soft Tissue Infection  (Excluding  Spine  and Diabetic Foot)  for appropriate  guidance  [10]. \nDiscussion  of Procedures  by Variant  \nVariant  1: Suspected  osteomyelitis of the foot in patients  with  diabetes  mellitus.

Unknown etiology. Initial imaging.  \nBone Scan Foot  \nThere is no relevant literature  to support t he use of nuclear medicine studies as the first imaging  study  in the \nevaluation of chronic foot pain.  \nCT Foot  \nThere is no relevant literature to support the use of CT as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot \npain.  \nMRI Foot  \nThere is no r elevant literature  to support the use of MRI as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot \npain.  \nRadiography Foot  \nConventional radiography can be useful to distinguish among different causes of chronic foot pain and is usually \nthe first imag ing study in evaluating patients with chronic foot pain.  \nThe value of radiographs in the diagnosis of tarsal coalitions has been extensively demonstrated. Overall \nsensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs \nin the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral \nand oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar \ncoalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs \non the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have \nbeen found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable \nmethods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  \nRadiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review \nby Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for \nradiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.  \nRadiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  \nusually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, \nosteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite \nversus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess \nwith radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton\u2019s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other \ncauses of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg\u2019s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals \nor soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . \nThough radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in \npatients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The \ncombination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a \nspecificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15]. \nUS Foot  \nUltrasound (US) is usually not indicate d as the first imaging  study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain, but may \nbe performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of pathologic conditions of the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, \nand other conditions such as tarsal tunnel syndrome, Morton\u2019s  neuroma , plantar plate tears,  and intermetatarsal \nbursitis. \nVariant 2: Persistent posttraumatic foot pain.

Ho wever, as with conventional CT, CT \nmyelography is inferior to MRI in assessing cord contus ion, cord hemorrhage, and postganglionic nerve root \ninjuries [40,41,43,57]. Performance of thoracolumbar CT myelogram can also be technically challenging, \nparticularly in patients with suspected  unstable thoracolumbar spine injury. \nCT Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nCT does play a role in the initial assessment of thoracic and lumbar spine injury. However, CT is significantly \ninferior to MRI in identifying many soft-tissue pathologies,  such as cord contusion, epidural hematoma, and nerve \nroot avulsions that can cause neurologic deficits re quiring surgical intervention [40,41,43,57]. Therefore, CT \nshould not be considered adequate for excluding signifi cant soft-tissue pathology in patients presenting with \nthoracolumbar spine trauma and neurologic deficit. \nMRI Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nMRI should be performed in patients who have possible spinal  cord injury, in whom there is clinical concern for \ncord compression that is due to disc protrusion or hema toma, and in those suspected of ligamentous instability. \nMRI is valuable for characterizing the cause of myelopathy in  patients with spinal cord  injury. The severity of the \ninjury\u2014including extent of intramedullary hemorrhage , length of edema, and evidence of cord transection\u2014\ncontributes to predicting outcome. Compression of the cord  by disc herniation, bone fragments, and hematomas is \nbest displayed on MRI, and MRI may be used to guide su rgical interventions [41,43]. For these reasons, the MRI \nexamination should include T2-weighted images as well as gradient-echo images. In the subacute and chronic \nstages after cord trauma, MRI can help define the extent of  cord injury. This is particularly important in patients \nwho suffer late deterioration, which is sometimes cau sed by treatable etiologies like the development or \nenlargement of intramedullary cavities,  such as a post-traumatic syringomyelia. \nAlthough numerous research studies ha ve reported a potential value of diffusion MRI for characterizing spinal \ncord injury [111], technical problems have prevented wid espread application of this technique to human studies. \nThe current utility of diffusion MRI for assessing cord trauma remains unknown. \nSummary of Recommendations \n\uf0b7 Variant 1: Imaging is not recommended for the initial imaging of patients \u226516 years of age and <65 years of \nage with suspected acute blunt cervi cal spine trauma when imaging is  not indicated by NEXUS or CCR \nclinical criteria and the patient meets low-risk criteria. \n\uf0b7 Variant 2: CT cervical spine without IV contrast is usually  appropriate for the initial imaging of patients \u226516 \nyears of age with suspected acute blunt trauma of the cervical spine when imaging is indicated by NEXUS or \nCCR clinical criteria. \n\uf0b7 Variant 3: MRI cervical spine without IV contrast is usua lly appropriate as the next imaging study for \npatients \u226516 years of age with suspected acute blunt trauma of the cervical spine and confirmed or suspected \ncervical spinal cord or nerve root injury, with or  without traumatic injury identified on cervical CT. \n\uf0b7 Variant 4: CT cervical spine without IV contrast and MRI cervical spine without IV contrast are usually \nappropriate for patients \u226516 years of age with acute cervical spine injury detected on radiographs and \ntreatment planning for mechanically unstable spine.

Therefore, CT \nshould not be considered adequate for excluding signifi cant soft-tissue pathology in patients presenting with \nthoracolumbar spine trauma and neurologic deficit. \nMRI Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nMRI should be performed in patients who have possible spinal  cord injury, in whom there is clinical concern for \ncord compression that is due to disc protrusion or hema toma, and in those suspected of ligamentous instability. \nMRI is valuable for characterizing the cause of myelopathy in  patients with spinal cord  injury. The severity of the \ninjury\u2014including extent of intramedullary hemorrhage , length of edema, and evidence of cord transection\u2014\ncontributes to predicting outcome. Compression of the cord  by disc herniation, bone fragments, and hematomas is \nbest displayed on MRI, and MRI may be used to guide su rgical interventions [41,43]. For these reasons, the MRI \nexamination should include T2-weighted images as well as gradient-echo images. In the subacute and chronic \nstages after cord trauma, MRI can help define the extent of  cord injury. This is particularly important in patients \nwho suffer late deterioration, which is sometimes cau sed by treatable etiologies like the development or \nenlargement of intramedullary cavities,  such as a post-traumatic syringomyelia. \nAlthough numerous research studies ha ve reported a potential value of diffusion MRI for characterizing spinal \ncord injury [111], technical problems have prevented wid espread application of this technique to human studies. \nThe current utility of diffusion MRI for assessing cord trauma remains unknown. \nSummary of Recommendations \n\uf0b7 Variant 1: Imaging is not recommended for the initial imaging of patients \u226516 years of age and <65 years of \nage with suspected acute blunt cervi cal spine trauma when imaging is  not indicated by NEXUS or CCR \nclinical criteria and the patient meets low-risk criteria. \n\uf0b7 Variant 2: CT cervical spine without IV contrast is usually  appropriate for the initial imaging of patients \u226516 \nyears of age with suspected acute blunt trauma of the cervical spine when imaging is indicated by NEXUS or \nCCR clinical criteria. \n\uf0b7 Variant 3: MRI cervical spine without IV contrast is usua lly appropriate as the next imaging study for \npatients \u226516 years of age with suspected acute blunt trauma of the cervical spine and confirmed or suspected \ncervical spinal cord or nerve root injury, with or  without traumatic injury identified on cervical CT. \n\uf0b7 Variant 4: CT cervical spine without IV contrast and MRI cervical spine without IV contrast are usually \nappropriate for patients \u226516 years of age with acute cervical spine injury detected on radiographs and \ntreatment planning for mechanically unstable spine.

Blunt trauma meeting criteria for thoracic and lumbar \nimaging. Initial imaging. \nImaging is a crucial component in assessment of thoracic and lumbar spine injury. Fr om 1998 to 2011, there was \nan adjusted annual increase of approximately 8% in thor acolumbar spine fractures in patients involved in motor \nvehicle collisions [15]. Thoracolumbar fractures are cha llenging to identify clinically, with only 48% to 75% of \nthoracolumbar injuries identified on clinical examination [16-18]. Unlike cervical injuries, well-defined clinical \ncriteria have not been established to determine when thor acolumbar imaging is appropriate in the setting of blunt \ntraumatic injury. Since clinical examination has poor sen sitivity for identifying thoracolumbar injuries, any high-\nrisk patient (mid line thoracolumbar tenderness, high-energ y mechanism of injury, or >60 years of age), as well as \nunexaminable patients (intoxicated, GCS <15, distracting injury), should undergo imaging of the thoracolumbar \nspine. Screening of the entire spine is advised, as an es timated 20% of spine injuries will have a second associated \nspinal injury at a noncontiguous level [26,27]. \nRadiography  Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nIt is well established that CT outperforms radiographs in  the diagnosis of thoracolumbar spine fractures [104-\n108]. Radiographs have a reported sens itivity of 49% to 62% for identifying thoracic spine fractures and 67% to \n82% sensitivity for identifying lumbar spine fractures [ 104,107,108] compared with the reported sensitivity of \n94% to 100% for identifying thoracolumbar spine fract ures using CT [104,107,108]. However, the clinical \nsignificance of fractures missed on radiographs is uncertain . If screening of the thoracolumbar spine is performed \nusing radiographs, imaging should consis t of anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the thoracic and lumbar \nspine with additional \u201cswimmer\u2019s lateral\u201d view of the upper thoracic spine if this region is obscured by the \noverlying shoulders. \nCT Myelography Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nThere is no role for CT myelography in the in itial assessment of thoraco lumbar spine injury. \nCT Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nCT is the gold standard for identifying fractures of the t horacolumbar spine with a reported sensitivity of 94% to \n100% [104,107-110]. In addition to identifying thoracolumbar spine injuri es, CT is excellent for delineating soft-\ntissue injuries of the chest, abdomen, and pelvic regi on that often accompany spinal fractures. However, CT \nimaging of the thoracolumbar spine is more commonly pe rformed as part of CT evaluation of the entire thorax, \nabdomen, and pelvis in trauma patients with high index of suspicion for soft-tissue injuries or who cannot be \ncleared by clinical examination. It is debated whethe r dedicated reformatted images using collimated field-of-\nviews centered on the thoracolumbar spine with dedicated  \u201chard kernel\u201d image algorithms are more accurate for \nidentifying bony pathology. Recent studi es indicate that identification of thoracolumbar spine fractures on routine \nthoracic, abdomen, and pelvic CT imaging using routine body large fields of view and \u201csoft kernel\u201d image \nalgorithms is comparable to dedicated thoracolumbar spine reformatted images.

Corey, MD.v \nSummary  of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nIn the United  States,  acute low back  pain (LBP),  with or without radiculopathy , is the leading  cause of years lived  \nwith disability  and the third  ranking cause of disability -adjusted  life years  [1]. It is the fifth most  common  reason  \nfor a physician  visit in the United  States  and accounts for approximately  3% of visits  to the emergency  department  \n[2]. \nThe American  College  of Physicians and the American  Pain Society  classify  LBP into the following  broad  \ncategories:  nonspecific LBP, back  pain potentially  associated  with radiculopathy or spinal  stenosis,  and back  pain \npotentially  associated  with another  specific spinal  cause [3]. Additionally,  guidelines  from  the American  College  \nof Physicians and the American  Pain Society  [3,4]  emphasize a focused  history  and physical  examination,  \nreassurance,  initial pain management  medications if necessary,  and consideration  of physical  therapies without  \nroutine  imaging  in patients  with nonspecific  LBP. Duration  of symptoms  also helps  guide  treatment  algorithms  in \npatients  with acute,  subacute,  or chronic  LBP. Additionally, assessment  of psychosocial  risk factors when  obtaining  \npatient  history  is a strong predictor  of patients  who are predisposed  to developing chronic  disabling LBP problems  \n[3]. \nAlthough there  is great  variability  in the definition  of acute and subacute  LBP, for the purposes  of this guideline,  \nwe will use the Institute  for Clinical Systems  Improvement  definitions  of 0 to 4 weeks to define  acute LBP,  4 to 12 \nweeks for subacute LBP, and >12 weeks for chronic  LBP [5]. \nIt is clear  that uncomplicated  acute  LBP and/or  radiculopathy is a benign,  self-limited  condition  that does not \nwarrant  any imaging studies [4,6,7] . Imaging is considered  in those  patients who have  had up to 6 weeks of medical  \nmanagement  and physical  therapy  that resulted  in little or no improvement  in their back  pain.  It is also considered  \nfor those  patients  presenting  with red flags , raising  suspicion  for a serious underlying  condition,  such as cauda \nequina  syndrome  (CES),  malignancy,  fracture,  or infection  (see Table 1). \n \naUniversity of Utah Health, Salt Lake City, Utah. bResearch Author, University of Utah Medical Center, Salt Lake City, Utah. cPanel Chair, University of \nUtah, Salt Lake City, Utah. dPanel Vice- Chair, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Saint Louis, Missouri. eUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, \nPennsylvania. fThe Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio. gMontefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.", "metadata": {"source": "ACR low back pain.pdf", "page": "5"}}, {"page_content": "One study found no \nstatistically  significant  difference in primary  outcome  after 1 year for patients  \u226565 years of age  who had spine  \nimaging  within  6 weeks after an initial visit for care for LBP versus  similar  patients who did not undergo early  \nimaging  [9].

Imaging abnormalities  \ncan be seen in a substantial  number  of people  without back  pain [11-13]. A prospective study by Carragee et al [13] \nfound that among patients with lumbar  imaging  abnormalities  before the onset  of LBP, 84% had unchanged or \nimproved findings  after symptoms  developed.  A systematic review of 33 articles found an increasing prevalence of \ndegenerative spine findings in asymptomatic patients of increasing age  [12]. For example,  disc protrusion  \nprevalence increased  from  29% of those 20 years of age to 43% of those  80 years of age in this asymptomatic  \npopulation.  A prospective  cohort  study of 20 patients  showed  no significant differences in MRI changes over 12 \nmonths  in patients  presenting  with acute LBP compared  with their asymptomatic counterparts , except  in disc \nherniation,  nerve  root compression,  and annular  fissure [15].

Corey, MD.v \nSummary  of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nIn the United  States,  acute low back  pain (LBP),  with or without radiculopathy , is the leading  cause of years lived  \nwith disability  and the third  ranking cause of disability -adjusted  life years  [1]. It is the fifth most  common  reason  \nfor a physician  visit in the United  States  and accounts for approximately  3% of visits  to the emergency  department  \n[2]. \nThe American  College  of Physicians and the American  Pain Society  classify  LBP into the following  broad  \ncategories:  nonspecific LBP, back  pain potentially  associated  with radiculopathy or spinal  stenosis,  and back  pain \npotentially  associated  with another  specific spinal  cause [3]. Additionally,  guidelines  from  the American  College  \nof Physicians and the American  Pain Society  [3,4]  emphasize a focused  history  and physical  examination,  \nreassurance,  initial pain management  medications if necessary,  and consideration  of physical  therapies without  \nroutine  imaging  in patients  with nonspecific  LBP. Duration  of symptoms  also helps  guide  treatment  algorithms  in \npatients  with acute,  subacute,  or chronic  LBP. Additionally, assessment  of psychosocial  risk factors when  obtaining  \npatient  history  is a strong predictor  of patients  who are predisposed  to developing chronic  disabling LBP problems  \n[3]. \nAlthough there  is great  variability  in the definition  of acute and subacute  LBP, for the purposes  of this guideline,  \nwe will use the Institute  for Clinical Systems  Improvement  definitions  of 0 to 4 weeks to define  acute LBP,  4 to 12 \nweeks for subacute LBP, and >12 weeks for chronic  LBP [5]. \nIt is clear  that uncomplicated  acute  LBP and/or  radiculopathy is a benign,  self-limited  condition  that does not \nwarrant  any imaging studies [4,6,7] . Imaging is considered  in those  patients who have  had up to 6 weeks of medical  \nmanagement  and physical  therapy  that resulted  in little or no improvement  in their back  pain.  It is also considered  \nfor those  patients  presenting  with red flags , raising  suspicion  for a serious underlying  condition,  such as cauda \nequina  syndrome  (CES),  malignancy,  fracture,  or infection  (see Table 1). \n \naUniversity of Utah Health, Salt Lake City, Utah. bResearch Author, University of Utah Medical Center, Salt Lake City, Utah. cPanel Chair, University of \nUtah, Salt Lake City, Utah. dPanel Vice- Chair, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Saint Louis, Missouri. eUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, \nPennsylvania. fThe Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio. gMontefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.", "metadata": {"source": "ACR low back pain.pdf", "page": "5"}}], "appropriateness": "USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE", "recommendation": "NO SCAN REQUIRED"}, {"question": "Patient Profile: 46 year old Caucasian female.

Diffusion -weighted  imaging  can show  signal  alteration  in the \nspinal  cord earlier  after patient symptom  onset  compared  with T2-weighted  images  [49,50] . As such,  diffusion-\nweighted  imaging  should be included anytime  there is concern  for spinal  cord ischemia [51]. \nWhen  considering  inflammatory  or infections  etiologies  of myelopathy,  visualization  of the osseous spinal column \nas well as the spinal  cord is useful  and best accomplished  noninvasively by MRI [4,7,45,52 -60]. \nDemyelinating  diseases such as MS and NMO can present  as acute myelopathy.  MS is the classic demyelinating \ndisease and is characterized  by lesions affecting  the spinal  cord (and brain)  and clinical  defects disseminated  in \nspace and time [61]. Spinal cord involvement  is seen in 80% to 90% of patients  with MS, most  commonly affecting  \nthe cervical  cord [62]. Patients  with primary  progressive  MS tend to have  more  spinal  cord involvement  than \npatients  with relapsing -remitting  MS [12]. When myelopathy due to MS is suspected,  MRI detection  of spinal  cord \nlesion(s)  fulfills  part of the 2016 Magnetic Resonance Imaging in MS (MAGNIMS ) criteria  [63]. NMO  is a \ndemyelinating  condition characterized  by optic  neuritis  and spinal  cord lesions.  Brain  lesions are not as commonly  \nencountered  in NMO as in MS, so, when  present , tend to predominate  in regions  around the third  and fourth  \nventricles [64-66]. ADEM  is a demyelinating  condition that typically  manifests as encephalopathy.  Spinal  cord \ninvolvement  is present  in approximately 25% of cases of ADEM . MRI of the spine  is generally  considered  the \nreference standard  for imaging  of the spinal  cord in cases of suspected  demyelinating  disease [63,67,68]  in addition  \nto excluding alternative  etiologies.  Contrast -enhanced  imaging  is recommended  for initial diagnostic  evaluation  \n[69,70] . \nMRA Spine \nThere is no relevant  literature  regarding the use of MR angiography (MRA ) in the initial imaging  evaluation  of \nacute onset  myelopathy.

Contrast -enhanced  imaging  is recommended  for initial diagnostic  evaluation  [69,70] . \nMetabolic  causes of chronic  or progressive  myelopathy result  in changes in the spinal  cord known  as subacute \ncombined degeneration  and are best evaluated  with MRI [11,83,84] . Chronic  infections  can have  a similar  \nappearance [12].  \nRadiation -induced  myelopathy is a rare dose-dependent  complication  that anatomically  localizes to a prior  radiation  \nport [85].

MRI without  \nand with IV contrast  is useful  to demonstrate spinal  cord edema  caused  by venous  hypertension and enlarged  veins  \nalong the dorsal  surface of the spinal  cord.  There may be patchy  intramedullary  enhancement  due to breakdown  of \nthe blood-cord  barrier.  In some  cases,  abnormal  vasculature may be identified  that may be useful  to guide  spinal  \narteriography  and intervention [5,89-91] . \nPrimary  and metastatic  tumors  of the spinal  cord very rarely  cause  myelopathy and are best evaluated  on contrast -\nenhanced  MRI of the spine  [92-96].

Corey, MD.v \nSummary  of Literature Review  \nIntroduction/Background \nIn the United  States,  acute low back  pain (LBP),  with or without radiculopathy , is the leading  cause of years lived  \nwith disability  and the third  ranking cause of disability -adjusted  life years  [1]. It is the fifth most  common  reason  \nfor a physician  visit in the United  States  and accounts for approximately  3% of visits  to the emergency  department  \n[2]. \nThe American  College  of Physicians and the American  Pain Society  classify  LBP into the following  broad  \ncategories:  nonspecific LBP, back  pain potentially  associated  with radiculopathy or spinal  stenosis,  and back  pain \npotentially  associated  with another  specific spinal  cause [3]. Additionally,  guidelines  from  the American  College  \nof Physicians and the American  Pain Society  [3,4]  emphasize a focused  history  and physical  examination,  \nreassurance,  initial pain management  medications if necessary,  and consideration  of physical  therapies without  \nroutine  imaging  in patients  with nonspecific  LBP. Duration  of symptoms  also helps  guide  treatment  algorithms  in \npatients  with acute,  subacute,  or chronic  LBP. Additionally, assessment  of psychosocial  risk factors when  obtaining  \npatient  history  is a strong predictor  of patients  who are predisposed  to developing chronic  disabling LBP problems  \n[3]. \nAlthough there  is great  variability  in the definition  of acute and subacute  LBP, for the purposes  of this guideline,  \nwe will use the Institute  for Clinical Systems  Improvement  definitions  of 0 to 4 weeks to define  acute LBP,  4 to 12 \nweeks for subacute LBP, and >12 weeks for chronic  LBP [5]. \nIt is clear  that uncomplicated  acute  LBP and/or  radiculopathy is a benign,  self-limited  condition  that does not \nwarrant  any imaging studies [4,6,7] . Imaging is considered  in those  patients who have  had up to 6 weeks of medical  \nmanagement  and physical  therapy  that resulted  in little or no improvement  in their back  pain.  It is also considered  \nfor those  patients  presenting  with red flags , raising  suspicion  for a serious underlying  condition,  such as cauda \nequina  syndrome  (CES),  malignancy,  fracture,  or infection  (see Table 1). \n \naUniversity of Utah Health, Salt Lake City, Utah. bResearch Author, University of Utah Medical Center, Salt Lake City, Utah. cPanel Chair, University of \nUtah, Salt Lake City, Utah. dPanel Vice- Chair, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Saint Louis, Missouri. eUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, \nPennsylvania. fThe Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio. gMontefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.", "metadata": {"source": "ACR low back pain.pdf", "page": "5"}}, {"page_content": "ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 6 Low Back  Pain Table  1.

However, an important age-related risk factor for spinal fracture presenting as LBP  is osteoporosis.  As \nbone mass decreases slowly over time, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age, and differs by sex, race, \nethnicity  [10], and comorbidities.

Fifty -seven  percent  of patients with LBP  and \n65% of patients  with radiculopathy  had disc herniation  as compared  with the 20% to 28% prevalence reported  in \nthe asymptomatic series [7].

MRI is the most sensitive imaging test for detecting soft -tissue abnormalities associated with neck \npain but is characterized by a high rate of abnormalities in asymptomatic individuals [22, 23]. Most cervical \ndiscectomies are performed by an anterior approach  without transgression of the epidural space ; therefore , \nepidural scar  or granulation tissue formation is minimal,  and contrast -enhanced imaging is not routine ly used after \nACDF  [55].  Gadolinium -enhanced MRI may have a role in the setting of neck pain and prior posterior -approa ch \ncervical fusion/ decompressive procedures, although the majority of the literature to date evaluates the use of \ngadolinium -based contrast in the differentiation of recurrent disc herniations  (a potentially actionable finding) \nfrom epidural scar in the setting of lumbar spine surgery  [56,57]. \nBone Scan Whole Body with SPECT or SPECT/CT Neck  \nThere is no current role for nuclear medicine studies as the initial examination in this scenario. The role of Tc -\n99m bone scan in the setting of new or worsening neck pain in the postsurgical patient is limited, as radionuclide \nscans may remain positive f or a year or more in the region of the operative bed [58]. SPECT/CT may offer \ndiagnostic information in the setting of suspected pseudoarthrosis or equivocal CT or MRI findings [59 ]. \nRadiography Cervical Spine  \nInitial radiographic  evaluation , including anteroposterior  and lateral  views,  is useful to  assess hardware integrity  \nand detect adjacent  segment  disease,  which  may contribut e to symptoms  [60,61]. The addition  of \nflexion/extension  radiographs  may be considered  to improve  detection  of vertebral  body nonunion or \npseudoarthrosis  [62] and may supplement  conventional  views following  ACDF  [63],  cervical  disc implantation , \nor posterior  cervical  fixation  [64-66 ]. \nMyelography Cervical Spine  \nCT myelog raphy has supplanted fluoroscopic myelography in most circumstances; however, there may be times \nwhen fluoroscopic myelography is also performed prior to CT imaging.

MRI is highly \naccurate for lesions involving the radial (central) zone of the disc, especially with the use of high -resolution fast \nspin-echo or 3-D grad ient-recalled pulse sequences [36]. There is some evidence suggesting that MRI performed \nwith a 3.0 T system is even more accurate than MRI performed with a 1.5 T system for TFCC lesions [37], but \nthere are no studies comparing the accuracy of the two field s trengths in the same patients. The sensitivity for \ntears of the ulnar attachment of the disc and the peripheral attachments (the ulnocarpal ligaments) are only fair \nwith noncontrast -enhanced wrist MRI [ 12,36]. IV contrast seldom provides added benefit in patients with ulnar -\nsided wrist pain but may increase sensitivity for TFCC lesions if MR arthrography is desired but direct joint \ninjection is not feasible. \nMR Arthrography  Wrist  \nDirect MR arthrography (performed with contrast injection of the radiocarpal or distal radioulnar compartments, \nalone or in combination) does result in better diagnostic accuracy for the T FCC compared with conventional MRI, \nespecially for ulnar -sided lesions [26, 38], even when compared to conventio nal MRI performed with a 3.0 T \nmagnet [7,8,39]. The same is true for intrinsic ligament injuries, such as those of the lunotriquetral ligament, \nwhich can produce ulnar -sided pain [7 ,8,39]. Performing either MR arthrography or noncontrast -enhanced MRI is \nusually appropriate in this scenario.  \nCT Arthrography  Wrist  \nThe accuracy of CT arthrography is superior to MRI  and similar to that  of MR arthrography for TFCC and \nintrinsic ligament lesions [8,40]. In addition, CT arthrography appears to be mor e accurate than either MRI or  MR \narthrography for identifying articular cartilage defects in the wrist [38]. In contrast to MRI and MR arthrography, \nCT arthrography is less sensitive to lesions occurring outside of the joint (like abnormalities of the extensor carpi \nulnaris tendon) that can result in ulnar -sided pain.  For these reasons, CT arthrography may be appropriate in this \nsetting , especially if there is a contraindication to MRI or if artifact from metallic implants produce too much \nartifact on MRI.  \nArthrography  Wrist  \nConventional (x-ray) arthrography\u2014performed with contrast injection into one  or more  wrist compartments\u2014has \nmoderate accuracy for the diagnosis of TFCC perforations [7 ].", "metadata": {"source": "ACR chronic hand and wrist pain.pdf", "page": "11"}}, {"page_content": "ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae 16 Chronic Wrist Pain  Arthrography  Wrist  \nOnce a scaphoid fracture is identified, Radiographic arthrography does not contribute to the evaluation for \ncomplications of the fracture.  \nVariant 12: Chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or nonspecific. Suspect carpal tunnel syndrome.  Next \nstudy. \nUS Wrist \nSeveral meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the \ncarpal  tunnel  inlet) is highly accurate for identifying carpal  tunnel syndrome  diagnosed clinically or with the \ncombination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US \nvaries depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the \nmeasurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary \nexamination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel \nsyndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal \ntunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, \nclinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of \ncarpal tunnel syndrome. US may be appropriate in cases where this initial evaluation is equivocal.  \nMRI Wrist  \nHistorically, carpal tunnel syndrome has been diagnosed based on clinical signs and sympt oms and confirmed by \nthe results of electrodiagnostic studies [67]. MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in cases in which this  \ninitial evaluation is equivocal. The MRI findings that have been reported in wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome \u2014\nincluding nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing\u2014may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value \nin patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68]. In rare cases of secondary carpal tunnel syndrome, MRI may identify \na mass lesion compressing the median nerve. There is some evidence that the length of T2 hyperintensity in the \nmedian nerve can help prognosticate the success of surgery [69] and that the shape and signal of the nerve predict \nclinical response to a steroid injection in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome [70 ].

Advanced imaging is usually performed to determine disease activity, guide management decisions, and prognosticate outcomes. In patients with RA, US  of the wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints can  show \ninflammation  as active synovitis. Identifying active synovitis with power Doppler assessment is a useful adjunct \nin making an early diagnosis of RA when a pati ent with early arthritis does not meet the 2010 criteria established \nby the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism [20]. The presence of \nsynovitis predicts progression of erosions [31 ] and erosions themselves [35]. US can also depict small bone \nerosions with high spatial resolution; h owever, US is less sensitive to erosions that occur on the radial or ulnar \nsides of the inner carpal bones because direct scanning of these regions is blocked, unlike the dorsal and volar \nbone surfaces. Furthermore, unlike MRI, US cannot show changes within the bone marrow, which are  the \nstrongest prognosticator s for disease progression in RA [27, 28,32-34].  In patients with established inflammatory \narthritis who are undergoing therapy, judging progression or reduction of synovitis may be more difficult with \nsequential US compared to sequential MRI.  \nMR Arthrography  Wrist  \nMR arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected inflammatory \narthritides. \nCT Wrist  \nWhile CT is more sensitive than radiographs for erosions, CT is not routinely used for the diagnosis and \nmanagement of patients with suspected inflammatory arthritides . \nCT Arthrography  Wrist  \nCT arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected inflammatory \narthritides. \nBone Scan  Wrist  \nBone scan does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients  with suspected inflammatory \narthritides. \nArthrography  Wrist  \nRadiographic arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected \ninflammatory arthritides. \nVariant 4: Chronic wrist pain.

However, generalizing from experience with septic arthrit is in other joints, joint \naspiration should not be delayed in order to obtain advanced imaging studies. In cases of suspected septic arthritis, \npercutaneous aspiration of the wrist is indicated, even when radiographs appear normal.

Microscopic crystal analysis should also be obtained \nif there is a possibility of gout, acute pseudogout, or hydroxyapatite deposition disease.

The utility of MRI in the detection of radiographically occult Chopart \nfractures has been demonstrated by Almeida et al [64] . Baker et al [71]  analyzed 31 occult fractures involving the \nankle and foot in h ockey players,  finding five occult fractures in the foot, all of which involved the navicular bone. \nPierre -Jerome et al [72] found 79% of cuboid fractures in the diabetic population that were radiographically occult \nusing MRI. MRI is also useful in the detection of occult fractures involving the fifth metatarsal bone (Jones fracture) \nand the subtalar join t [65,73] . There is no evidence in the literature supporting the routine use of contrast in the \ndiagnosi s of occult fractures.  \nMRI has replaced bone scans in the evaluation of symptomatic accessory ossicles. MRI allows optimal visualization \nof the bone marrow within the ossicle and visualization of the synchondrosis. Accessory ossicles may also be \nassociated  with tendon pathology, which is also well assessed on MRI [74]. MRI allows clear demonstration of the \nfindings often associated with posterior ankle impingement syndrome [75]. Contrast administration is not routinely \nperformed when assessing symptomatic accessory ossicles on MRI; however, contrast within a disrupted \nsynchondrosis may be demonstrated on MR arthrography stu dies [69]. \nUS Foot   \nAlthough not routinely performed, previous studies have demonstrated the role of US in the detection of occult foot \nfractures. On US, these can be seen as cortical irregularities and are frequently associated with soft -tissue injury in \nthe acute or subacute setting. Wang et al [76]  demonstrated 24 cases of radiographically occult ankle and foot \nfractures in 268 patients. Of these, foot fractures were found most frequently in the calcaneus and metatarsals, and \nless frequently in the navicular, cuboid , and cuneiform bones.  \nOn US, several findings have been reported in cases of painful accessory ossicles, including patients with posterior \nankle impingement syndrome ; however , optimal characterization of the synchondrosis is difficult on US [62] . High -\nresolution US offers some advantages over other imagin g modalities because it allows dynamic exploration of the \nfoot with further assessment of stability of the synchondrosis and tendon tears when present as well as direct clinical \ncorrelation and comparative evaluation with the asymptomatic foot [77] . Power Doppler US has proven useful in \nidentifying increased blood supply in the setting of ankle impingement [78,79] . \nVariant 6: Chronic foot pain. Entrapment s yndromes.

Bankart \nlesions have a particularly high association with transient shoulder dislocations [50], and a transient shoulder \ndislocation should be presumed if a Bankart lesion is present. A close association exists bet ween Bankart and \nHill-Sachs lesions [ 51], and one should be sought out whenever the other is identified on radiographs. Both \nBankart and Hill -Sachs lesions can present as nonosseous  lesions that are occult on r adiographs and noncontrast \nCT. \nMRI Shoulder  \nSimilar to MR arthrography, noncontrast MRI is comparable to CT in evaluating glenoid and humeral head bone \nloss [12,18]. In general, noncontrast MRI performs well in diagnosing labroligamentous injuries [ 20,52]. \nHowever, noncontrast MRI is considered inferior to MR arthrography for assessing labroligamentous pathology \nfrequently associated with Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions [ 17,19]. Noncontrast MRI is a good alternative to MR \narthrography in the setting of acute injury when significant glenohumeral joint effusion is present to assist in \nvisualization of intra -articular soft -tissue pathology.  \nMR Arthrography  Shoulder  \nMR arthrography is the preferred study for evaluating subacute or chronic Bankart lesions because of  its soft -\ntissue contrast. Multiple studies have shown MR arthrography to be reliable in diagnosing labroligamentous \ninjuries [12,17,52] and superior to noncontrast MRI for this indication [ 17,19]. MR arthrography has been shown \nto be equivalent to CT in the assess ment of glenoid and humeral head bone loss [ 12,18], while being superior to \nCT in assessment of labroligamentous in juries [12]. MR arthrography is also able to delineate humeral head and \nglenoid cartilage, which can be important because some Hill -Sachs lesions affect  cartilage only  [11]. \nCT Shoulder  \nNoncontrast CT has historically been used to assess Hill -Sachs and bony Bankart lesions. However, MRI has \nbeen shown to be equivalent to CT for a ssessing both glenoid and humeral head bone loss [ 12,18,53], and CT is \nlimited in the assessment of cartilaginous Hill -Sachs lesions [11]. In addition, CT cannot assess injury to \nsoft-tissue structures like the labroligamentous complex, which further limits its usefulness in evaluating Bankart \nlesions. CT should be reserved for patients with a contraindication to MRI or patients in whom MRI assessment \nof bone loss is limited.  \nCT Arthrography  Shoulder  \nCT arthrography has sho wn fair agreement between observers and is comparable to MR arthrography in \ndiagnosing Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions [ 12,13].

MRI has been shown to have similar performance to CT in the evaluation of Hill-Sachs \nlesions and glenoid bone loss [12,18]. MR arthrography has also been found to be reliable in diagnosi ng anterior \nshoulder instability and labroligamentous injuries [58,59]. MR arthrography has specifically o utperformed \nnoncontrast MRI in assessment of glenohumeral ligament and anterior labral injuries [ 17,19], which ar e \ncommonly seen in shoulder instability. MR arthrogr aphy has also outperformed noncontrast MRI in diagnosis of \nrotator cuff tears [17,19], which is a common associated finding in older patients with shoulder dislocation. \nHowever, high sensitivities reported for MR arthrography in the detection of labral pathology may not be \napplicable to patients with clinically unstable shoulders. A retrospective review of 90 patients with clinically \nunstable shoulders selected for arthroscopy [ 60] found that MR arthrography had a sensitivity of 65% for \ndetection of labral  tears. The authors proposed that this discrepancy with prior studies was the result of different \npatient selection criteria (clinically unstable in their study versus less-specific symptoms such as shoulder pain in \nothers) and the interpretation of MR art hrography by experienced musculoskeletal radiologists [ 60]. For this \ndocument, it is assumed the procedure is performed and interpreted by an expert.  \nMRI Shoulder  \nMRI without contrast may be pre ferred to MR arthrography in the setting of acute shoulder dislocation when a \npost-traumatic joint effusion is present to provide sufficient visualization of soft -tissue structures. In the subacute \nor chronic setting, the glenohumeral joint effusion is usually too small to provide adequate joint distention for \noptimal assessment  of soft -tissue structures.

Overall \nsensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs \nin the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral \nand oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar \ncoalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs \non the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have \nbeen found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable \nmethods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  \nRadiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review \nby Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for \nradiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.  \nRadiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  \nusually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, \nosteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite \nversus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess \nwith radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton\u2019s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other \ncauses of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg\u2019s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals \nor soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . \nThough radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in \npatients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The \ncombination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a \nspecificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15]. \nUS Foot  \nUltrasound (US) is usually not indicate d as the first imaging  study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain, but may \nbe performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of pathologic conditions of the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, \nand other conditions such as tarsal tunnel syndrome, Morton\u2019s  neuroma , plantar plate tears,  and intermetatarsal \nbursitis. \nVariant 2: Persistent posttraumatic foot pain. Radiographs negative or equivocal. Clinical concern includes \ncomplex regional pain syndrome type I. Next imaging study.  \n3-Phase Bone Scan Foot  \nA 3-phase bone scan may be useful in cases of suspected complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type I reflex \nsympathetic dystrophy , and several imaging findings have been described.", "metadata": {"source": "ACR chronic foot pain.pdf", "page": "4"}}], "appropriateness": "INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION", "recommendation": "INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION"}]
