Unlike \nCT, MRI shows concomitant ligament  injuries, including tears of the scapholunate ligament, which may affect \nsurgical treatment [26,27]. Despite these advantages,  MRI performed immediately at the time of injury has little \nadded value for determining which patients go on to surgery [ 23]. \nMRI is especially useful in evaluating  hand soft -tissues injuries, including the collateral ligaments, volar plates, \ntendons, and pulleys.

The downside of this option is that it \nresults in delay of diagnosis , which may lead to functional impairment . \nCT Area of Interest  \nWhen the initial radiographs are equivocal, CT  without IV contrast  is commonly used to exclude or confirm \nsuspected wrist fractures [18]. CT shows intra-articular extension of distal radius fractures more frequently than \nradiography.  Three-dimensional reconstructions can be particularly helpful in preoperative planning for complex \narticular injuries  [7,8]. \nCT should be used to exclude an occult fracture of the upper extremity.

New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or \npatients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].

Overall \nsensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs \nin the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral \nand oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar \ncoalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs \non the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have \nbeen found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable \nmethods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  \nRadiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture.

Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  \nusually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, \nosteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite \nversus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess \nwith radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton\u2019s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other \ncauses of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg\u2019s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals \nor soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . \nThough radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in \npatients with a painful heel.

Ho wever, as with conventional CT, CT \nmyelography is inferior to MRI in assessing cord contus ion, cord hemorrhage, and postganglionic nerve root \ninjuries [40,41,43,57].

Blunt trauma meeting criteria for thoracic and lumbar \nimaging. Initial imaging. \nImaging is a crucial component in assessment of thoracic and lumbar spine injury. Fr om 1998 to 2011, there was \nan adjusted annual increase of approximately 8% in thor acolumbar spine fractures in patients involved in motor \nvehicle collisions [15]. Thoracolumbar fractures are cha llenging to identify clinically, with only 48% to 75% of \nthoracolumbar injuries identified on clinical examination [16-18]. Unlike cervical injuries, well-defined clinical \ncriteria have not been established to determine when thor acolumbar imaging is appropriate in the setting of blunt \ntraumatic injury. Since clinical examination has poor sen sitivity for identifying thoracolumbar injuries, any high-\nrisk patient (mid line thoracolumbar tenderness, high-energ y mechanism of injury, or >60 years of age), as well as \nunexaminable patients (intoxicated, GCS <15, distracting injury), should undergo imaging of the thoracolumbar \nspine. Screening of the entire spine is advised, as an es timated 20% of spine injuries will have a second associated \nspinal injury at a noncontiguous level [26,27]. \nRadiography  Thoracic and Lumbar Spine \nIt is well established that CT outperforms radiographs in  the diagnosis of thoracolumbar spine fractures [104-\n108]. Radiographs have a reported sens itivity of 49% to 62% for identifying thoracic spine fractures and 67% to \n82% sensitivity for identifying lumbar spine fractures [ 104,107,108] compared with the reported sensitivity of \n94% to 100% for identifying thoracolumbar spine fract ures using CT [104,107,108].", "metadata": {"source": "ACR suspected spine trauma.pdf", "page": "17"}}], "appropriateness": "USUALLY APPROPRIATE", "recommendation": "MRI"}, {"question": "Case: 48 year old Indian male.

Other  demyelinating  processes such as NMO and ADEM  \ncan present  as chronic  myelopathy less commonly.  In patients  with chronic  or progressive myelopathy,  MRI  of the \nspinal  cord can identify  spinal  cord lesions suggestive  of demyelinating  disease in addition  to excluding  alternative  \netiologie s. Contrast -enhanced  imaging  is recommended  for initial diagnostic  evaluation  [69,70] . \nMetabolic  causes of chronic  or progressive  myelopathy result  in changes in the spinal  cord known  as subacute \ncombined degeneration  and are best evaluated  with MRI [11,83,84] . Chronic  infections  can have  a similar  \nappearance [12].  \nRadiation -induced  myelopathy is a rare dose-dependent  complication  that anatomically  localizes to a prior  radiation  \nport [85]. Autoimmune  myelitis  includes  paraneoplastic myelopathy [86,87] . MRI  without  and with IV contrast  is \nuseful  to evaluate the spinal  cord in these instances.  \nVascular  malformations  can likewise present  with chronic  and slowly  progressive  myelopathy [88]. MRI without  \nand with IV contrast  is useful  to demonstrate spinal  cord edema  caused  by venous  hypertension and enlarged  veins  \nalong the dorsal  surface of the spinal  cord.  There may be patchy  intramedullary  enhancement  due to breakdown  of \nthe blood-cord  barrier.  In some  cases,  abnormal  vasculature may be identified  that may be useful  to guide  spinal  \narteriography  and intervention [5,89-91] .", "metadata": {"source": "ACR myelopathy.pdf", "page": "6"}}, {"page_content": "ACR Appropriateness  Criteria\u00ae 12 Low Back  Pain spinal  canal  patency.

Additionally, unlike the case \nfor the knee and other larger joints, MRI shows only fair sensitivity for depicting articular cartilage defects in the \ndistal radius and carpal bones, even with the use of indirect MR ar thrography or 3.0 T scanners [59,60]. The \npresence of focal bone marrow edema may be a clue to underl ying chondral defects [59]. Despite these \nlimitations, noncontrast MRI and noncontrast CT are both usually appropriate exam ination s to evaluate potential \nsequelae of chronic scaphoid fractures, but only one of the tests needs to be performed for a given patient. The use \nof IV contrast for MR I may be appropriate in some cases.  \nMR Arthrography  Wrist  \nA single study found that direct MR arthrography was more sensitive for articular cartilage defects compared to \nconventional MRI, but the same study showed that CT arthrography was even more sensitive [38]. MR \narthrography is not routinely used in this setting.  \nCT Wrist  \nEither CT without IV contrast or MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate in this scenario.
