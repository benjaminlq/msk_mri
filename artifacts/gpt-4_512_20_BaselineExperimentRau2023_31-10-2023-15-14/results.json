Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type \nresult in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men \n[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs \nwill continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of \nlife following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays \nin diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -\nand long-term mortality [6-13].

Next  imaging  study.  \nThe body regions covered in this clinical scenario are the sacroiliac joints, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine. \nThese body regions might be evaluated separately or in combination as guided by physical examination findings, \npatient history, and other available information. \n \nBone  Scan  with  SPECT  or SPECT/CT  Spine  Area  of Interest  \nBone  scintigraphy is not routinely  suggested  in the evaluation  of patients  with suspected  axSpA  because of  its lack \nof established  diagnostic  utility  [22]. Conventional  bone  scintigraphy has low to moderate sensitivity  and variable  \nspecificity  for the diagnosis  of axSpA  [41,42,50] . If bone  scintigraphy is used,  because of  the complexity  of the \nspine anatomy,  the use of SPECT should be performed  during  the examination  [51]. Although  bone  scintigraphy is \nnot typically  performed  during the evaluation  of suspected  axSpA  because of  its limited  diagnostic  utility, there is \nrecent  data that hybrid SPECT/CT has higher  sensitivity  than conventional  bone  scintigraphy in the detection  of \nsacroiliitis  [52,53] , although  there  is not enough evidence at this time to support  its routine  use for evaluating  the \nsacroiliac joints  or spine . \nCT Spine  Area  of Interest  \nCT demonstrates structural  changes in the spine  that may not be apparent  on radiographs  [22], including structural  \nchanges such as erosions,  sclerosis,  bone  formation,  syndesmophytes,  and ankyloses  [49,54] .", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "ACR inflammatory back pain.pdf"}, "score": 0.8901568758753141}, {"page_content": "Although  there is \nagreement  in the literature  and among experts that MRI should include  the sacroiliac  joints, there is not a \nconsistently  established  convention  to guide  the clinician  on whether  to image  only the sacroiliac joints  or both the \nsacroiliac joints  and the spine  in patients  with suspected  axSpA  [1,3,19,22] . Not unexpectedly,  there  is heterogeneity  \nin clinical  practice  regarding the use of MRI to evaluate the sacroiliac joints  and/or  spine  in these patients  [112] . \nOne study has shown  that the majority  of patients  can be diagnosed with axSpA  by obtaining MRI of the sacroiliac  \njoints only [60]. Another  study shows that the addition  of spine  MRI  to sacroiliac joint MRI adds little incremental  \nvalue  in the diagnosis  of nonradiographic  axSpA  [113] . However,  axSpA  often  involves  the axial  skeleton  proximal  \nto the sacroiliac joints  and may exhibit  findings  isolated  to the spine.  For example,  in a study of whole -body MRI  \nin active axSpA,  99% of patients  were  found to have  active inflammatory  lesions  in the axial  skeleton,  with \ninflammatory  changes isolated  to the sacroiliac joints  in 52% of patients,  inflammatory  changes isolated  to the spine  \nin 5% of patients , and with inflammatory  changes at both the sacroiliac joints  and spine  in 41% of patients  [59]. \nOther  studies have  shown  widely  varying degrees of isolated  spinal  involvement  on MRI ranging from  1% to 49% \n[19,60- 63,114,115] .
