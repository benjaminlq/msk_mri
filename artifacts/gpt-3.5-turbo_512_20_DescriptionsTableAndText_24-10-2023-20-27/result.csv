Page Content: Most soft -tissue injuries (such as labral tears and rotator cuff tears) can undergo a period of 
conservative management prior to considering surgery. However, in addition to the specific imaging findings 
related to a traumatic injury, indications and timing of surgical treatment of many traumatic shoulder injuries are 
dependent on patient age, comorbidities, current activity level, and expected activity level.  
Imaging of chronic shoulder pain is beyond the scope of this topic  and is cove red in the  ACR Appropriateness 
Criteria® on “Shoulder Pain– Atraumatic ” [3]. 
Discussion o f Procedures  by Variant  
Variant 1:  Traumatic shoulder pain. Any etiology . Initial imaging . 
Radiography Shoulder  
Radiographs are the preferred initial study performed in the setting of traumatic shoulder pain . They can delineate 
shoulder malalignment and most shoulder fractures [ 4,5]. A standard set of shoulder radiographs for trauma 
should include at least three  views: anterior -posterior (AP) views in internal and external rotation and an axillary 
or scapula-Y view. Axillary or scapula-Y views are vital in evaluating traumatic shoulder injuries as 
acromioclavicular and glenohumeral dislocations can be misclassified on AP  views [6,7]. Radiographs provide 
good delineation of bony anatomy to assess for fracture and appropriate shoulder alignment, which are the two 
primary concerns in management of acute traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs should also be performed upright 
since malalignment of the shoul der can be under -represented on supine radiographs [ 4]. Additional views, such as 
the Bernageau view, have been sho wn to be effective in demonstrating the degree of bone loss of the glenoid or 
humeral head [ 8]. 
CT Shoulder  
Computed tomography ( CT) is better able than radiogr aphs to characteriz e fracture patterns [ 9-11].

Page Content: Although evaluation  of glenoid bony integrity  is typically  better  with CT imaging,  some  practitioners have  used 
ultrashort  or zero echo  time sequences [96-98], 3-D sequences  [99], or conventional  MRI  sequences  [100]  to 
measure glenoid bone  loss with a high concordance  to CT images.  
Radiography Shoulder  Additional Views  
There are several  options  for additional  radiographic  views in patients  with suspected  instability  [1]. The West  Point  
and Garth  views can demonstrate the anterior  inferior glenoid at a better  advantage  in patients  with a suspected  
Bankart  fracture.  A Stryker  notch  view can sometimes demonstrate  a Hill-Sachs lesion  that is difficult  to see on 
conventional  projections.  Although these additional  projections  are used by some  practitioners , they do not usually  
alleviate  the need  for advanced  imaging.  
US Shoulder  
The posterior  labrum  can be reliably  visualized  with US, with posterior  labral  tears potentially  visualized  
particularly  if the joint is distended  [101] . However,  US is of limited  benefit  in assessing  the anterior  
labroligamentous  complex,  superior  labrum,  articular  surface,  and subchondral  bone.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 8 Shoulder Pain –Traumatic  Variant 2: Traumatic shoulder pain. Nonlocalized shoulder pain. Negative radiographs . Next imaging 
study. 
Appropriately positioned  radiographs can exclude shoulder dislocation and most displaced fractures as the 
etiology for post -traumatic shoulder pain. In the setting of normal shoulder radiographs, the most common causes 
of post -traumatic shoulder pain are soft -tissue injuries such  as rotator cuff and labral tears.  
MRI Shoulder  
Noncontrast MRI is a reasonable imaging study in the setting of acute nonlocalized traumatic shoulder pain and 
noncontributory radiographs. In the acute trauma setting, noncontrast MRI may be preferred to MR arthrography , 
as acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint effusion for assessment of intra -articular 
soft-tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic 
pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [34,35]. MRI is also sensitive for diagnosing bone marrow 
contusion and has  been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries in pediatric patients [ 36,37]. 
MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography has been found to be superior to noncontrast MRI in the diagnosis of labroligamentous and 
partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [17,19]. In the acute trauma setting, however, noncontrast MRI may be 
preferred to MR arthrography because acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint 
effusion for assessment of intra-arti cular soft -tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing 
extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [ 34,35]. MRI is also sensitive

Shoulder dislocation or instability is most co mmon in the anterior direction. Younger patients are more likely to 
have labroligamentous injury and persistent instability after dislocation compared with older patients [54]. Older 
patients are more likely to have rotator cuff tears in association with shoulder dislocation [ 55]. Coexisting 
humeral avulsion of the glenohumeral ligament and significant glenoid bone loss have been found in up to 10% of 
patients with recurrent shoulder instability [ 56], which underscores the need to assess both osseous and 
labroligamentous pathology in patients with shoulder dislocation or instability. Glenoid morphology and bone 
loss can play a significant factor in recurrent shoulder dislocations [15, 16,57], which may require bone grafting in 
order to restore stability [ 57].",False

Page Content: MRI Spine  Area  of Interest  
Although MRI  of the sacroiliac joints  has high utility  for the diagnosis  of axSpA,  some  patients  will not demonstrate  
imaging  features of axSpA  in the sacroiliac joints  on MRI as indicated  by sensitivities  of all studies to varying 
degrees below  100%  [22], and therefore  some  patients may need  further imaging  evaluation  with MRI given that it 
is the imaging  modality  of choice for the diagnosis  of axSpA  [1,3,19,22] . Studies  have  shown  widely varying  
degrees of isolated  spinal  involvement  on MRI in axSpA  ranging from  1% to 49% [19,59-63,114,115] . Therefore,  
imag ing of the spine  is beneficial  for patients  in whom  there is suspicion  for axSpA  but imaging  of the sacroiliac 
joints  has been  negative.  Some  authors  have  shown  the utility  of using  whole -spine  or whole -body  MRI to identify  
the burden of disease rather  than selecting  specific areas of the spine  to image  because findings  may be potentially  
isolated  to any portion of the spine  [10,59,63,89,114,120-122] . 
The spine  MRI  findings  of axSpA  include  the active inflammatory  changes of spondylitis  and spondylodiscitis,  the 
inflammatory  changes of the costovertebral  joints,  costotransverse joints,  and facet  joints  and areas of enthesitis  
along other  vertebral  ligamentous  attachments [123] . The chronic  structural  changes of fatty deposition,  erosions,  
and syndesmophytes  are also characteristic findings  [123] .

Canada and Berlin  methods  have  been  used as scoring  systems for quantification  and follow -up of lesions in the

Radiography Sacroiliac  Joints   
There is no standard  method of following  patients  with radiographs  to evaluate for progression of structural  changes  
[22], and the American  College  of Rheumatology recommends against  routine  radiographic  follow -up given  the 
lack of proven benefit  [30]. Repeat  radiographs  can be obtained as necessary  for counseling  patients  on the status  
and prognosis  of their disease,  although radiographs  are more  typically  performed  to evaluate the spine  rather  than 
the sacroiliac  joints  [30]. This is because of  the low utility  of sacroiliac joint radiographs  for detecting  disease  
progression based  on the relatively  poor intra- and interreader  reliability  of interpretation  [141] . Radiographs  can 
demonstrate evolving  structural  changes or bone  formation,  although these changes occur  slowly  over time at the 
sacroiliac joints, often  requiring  years to detect  a change and prompting many  authors  to suggest  a radiographic  
imaging  interval  of axSpA  patients  of no less than 2 years for assessment  of disease progression [141- 146]. There 
is evidence that patients  on TNF -inhibitors  may have  slower  progression of structural  damage at the sacroiliac joints  
[147,148] , although there is some  disagreement  in the literature  [149] .

axSpA  [66,67] ; however,  there is conflicting  evidence regarding the extent  to which  tracer  uptake  correlates with 
specific inflammatory  and structural  lesions seen on CT and MRI resulting  in uncertain ty about  its diagnostic  utility  
[64,67- 72]. In one study,  the interreader  reliability  of diagnosing  sacroiliitis  on PET/CT was poor and substantially  
lower  than that for MRI or CT [67]. In a small  study using  radiographs  as the reference standard,  F-18-fluoride

inherent  limitations  in the use of radiographs  as the reference standard  for diagnosing  axSpA  [73]. Given  the 
available data,  the utility  of PET/CT in the diagnosis  of axSpA , including its utility  in assessment  of the spine,  is 
uncertain  at this time.

Page Content: Arthrography  Wrist  
Radiographic arthrography  is not routinely used to evaluate a palpable mass or ganglion cyst . 
Variant 10: Chronic wrist pain. Suspect occult fracture or stress fracture. Radiographs nondiagnostic. 
Next study.  
MRI Wrist  
Either MRI without I V contrast or CT without IV contrast is usually appropriate in this scenario. MRI is highly 
sensitive to changes in bone marrow composition, and thus is frequently used to identify radiographically occult 
acute fractures throughout the skeleton, including in the wrist (see the ACR Appropriateness Criteria® topic on 
“Acute Hand and Wrist Trauma” [49]). In patients with persistent symptoms thought to be due to an occult wrist 
fracture, MRI can be used as an alternative to presumptive casting and repeat radiographs [ 12]. MRI is also 
sensitive to stress fractures and stress injuries of the physes, for example, in gymnasts [50].  IV contrast does not 
add to the examination and is usually not appropriate.  
CT Wrist  
Either CT without IV contrast or MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate in this scenario. CT can provide high-detail imaging of bone cortex a nd trabeculae and thus can be used to identify radiographically occult  
fractures and stress fractures. Acquisition times are shorter for CT compared to MRI, and CT may be easier to 
perform in patients who are casted. However, MRI’s sensitivity for bone bru ises and soft -tissue injuries is greater 
than CT. In specific circumstances—like suspected fractures of the hook of the hamate— CT may be preferable to 
MRI.  IV contrast does not add to the examination and is usually not appropriate.  
Radiography Wrist  
If not  obtained as part of the initial radiographic series, additional views such as a carpal tunnel or semipronated 
oblique projection  (a “scaphoid view”) may show an otherwise radiographically  occult fracture, and may be 
appropriate .

Page Content: Variant 2: Suspect acute hand or wrist trauma. Initial radiographs nega tive or equivocal. Next imaging 
study. 
Radiograph y Area of Interest  
In patients with clinical suspicion of hand or wrist fracture and negative radiographs, one option is to place the 
patient in a short arm cast and repeat the radiographs at 10  to 14 days [ 13]. The downside of this option is that it 
results in delay of diagnosis , which may lead to functional impairment . 
CT Area of Interest  
When the initial radiographs are equivocal, CT  without IV contrast  is commonly used to exclude or confirm 
suspected wrist fractures [18]. CT shows intra-articular extension of distal radius fractures more frequently than 
radiography.  Three-dimensional reconstructions can be particularly helpful in preoperative planning for complex 
articular injuries  [7,8]. 
CT should be used to exclude an occult fracture of the upper extremity. Unlike MRI, CT cannot evaluate for 
concomitant ligamentous injuries  [19-21 ]. 
CT is useful in diagnosing injuries that are difficult to recognize on radiographs, such as carpometacarpal joint 
fracture dislocations. For metacarpal and digital  fractures, CT is usually not indicated during acute injury [ 22]. 
There is no evidence to support the use of CT with IV contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist trauma.  
MRI Area o f Interest  
When initial radiographs are normal but there is high clinical suspicion for fracture, MRI without IV contrast can 
detect fractures of the distal radius and carpal bones [12,23-25] . One study of patients in which the radiographic 
findings did not explain the clinical symptoms reported that the MRI led to a change in diagnosis in 55% of 
patients and a change in patient management in 66%  [12]. However, another study of patients with acutely injured 
wrists reported that the MRI did not predict the need for treatment better than the combination of physical 
examination and radiography [ 23]. More importantly, there was no difference in outcomes  with MRI compared 
with radiography [24].

While CT with IV contrast enhancement can depict abscesses, it is usually not appropriate  for evaluation of 
suspected wrist infections.  
CT Arthrography  Wrist  
CT arthrography is not routinely used to eval uate suspected wrist infection.  
US Wrist  
There may be a role for US in the staging of infections (for example, to delineate the location and e xtent of soft -
tissue abscesses) after aspiration has been performed.  Alternatively, US may be used in conjunction with 
aspiration as a method to first identify collections and then as the imaging method to guide aspiration.

Bone scan is not  routinely used to eval uate suspected chronic wrist infection.  
Arthrography  Wrist  
Radiographic arthrography  is not routinely used to eval uate suspected wrist infection.  
Variant 5:  Ulnar -sided chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or nonspecific . Next study.  
MRI Wrist  
Both traumatic and degenerative lesions of the TFCC can produce chronic, ulnar -sided wrist pain . MRI is highly 
accurate for lesions involving the radial (central) zone of the disc, especially with the use of high -resolution fast 
spin-echo or 3-D grad ient-recalled pulse sequences [36]. There is some evidence suggesting that MRI performed 
with a 3.0 T system is even more accurate than MRI performed with a 1.5 T system for TFCC lesions [37], but 
there are no studies comparing the accuracy of the two field s trengths in the same patients. The sensitivity for 
tears of the ulnar attachment of the disc and the peripheral attachments (the ulnocarpal ligaments) are only fair 
with noncontrast -enhanced wrist MRI [ 12,36]. IV contrast seldom provides added benefit in patients with ulnar -
sided wrist pain but may increase sensitivity for TFCC lesions if MR arthrography is desired but direct joint 
injection is not feasible.

CT, MRI shows concomitant ligament  injuries, including tears of the scapholunate ligament, which may affect 
surgical treatment [26,27]. Despite these advantages,  MRI performed immediately at the time of injury has little 
added value for determining which patients go on to surgery [ 23]. 
MRI is especially useful in evaluating  hand soft -tissues injuries, including the collateral ligaments, volar plates, 
tendons, and pulleys. For metacarpal and digital fractures, MRI is usually not indicated during acute injury [ 22]. 
There is no evidence to support the use of MRI with IV contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist trauma.  
US Area of Interest  
US may have a limited utility  for evaluating bone injuries. Christiansen et al  [28] reported 47% sensitivity and 
61% specificity of US  for the detection of scaphoid fractures . They concluded that US  is not suitable for the early 
diagnosis of scaphoid fracture.  In contrast, Hauger et al  [29] reported that using cortical disruption as a diagnostic 
criterion on US is an accurate sign for detecting occult fractures of the scaphoid waist. Further study of US  for the 
diagnosis of occult fractures is needed .

Assessment of carpal instability with conventional radiographs requires careful attention to radiographic 
positioning.  In low -grade injuries, radiographs are usually normal.  Scapholunate diastasis of >4 mm and dorsal til t 
of the lunate of > 10° suggests dorsal intercalated segmental instability  [30,31].

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 5 Acute Hand and Wrist Trauma  Most fractures of the thumb are visible on a 2-view radiographic examination, although there is a slight increase 
in dia gnostic yield with the addition of an oblique projection [ 13], which can be obtained along with a PA 
examination of the whole hand.  
In patients with suspected finger tendon injuries, radiographs are used to detect fracture fragments, as large 
fragments may require open reduction and internal fixation.  Radiographs are usually sufficient for  the evaluation 
of osseous “mallet” injuries, which include bony avulsion at the insertion of the extensor mechanism of the finger 
to the distal interphalangeal joint [16]. In these injuries, involvement of more than one -third of the articular 
surface usually requires operative fixation.  Palmar displacement of the distal phalanx or an interfragmentary gap 
of >3 mm is also an indication for surgery [ 16]. With extensor tendon injuries, radiographs are commonly used to 
assess for bone involve ment and determine need for operative fixation [ 17]. 
CT Area of Interest  
In patients with intra -articular fractures seen on radiography , CT shows articular fracture fragment displacement, 
depression, and comminution more accurately than conventional radiographs [ 7,9,10]. CT measurements of 
articular surface gap and step -off are more reproducible than radiographs [7]. The addition of 3- D surface -
rendered reconstructions to the standard 2 -D CT images has been shown to change operative management in up to 
48% of intra -articular distal radius fractures [8].

trauma.

Once a scaphoid fracture is identified, Radiographic arthrography does not contribute to the evaluation for 
complications of the fracture.  
Variant 12: Chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or nonspecific. Suspect carpal tunnel syndrome.  Next 
study. 
US Wrist 
Several meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the 
carpal  tunnel  inlet) is highly accurate for identifying carpal  tunnel syndrome  diagnosed clinically or with the 
combination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US 
varies depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the 
measurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary 
examination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel 
syndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal 
tunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, 
clinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of 
carpal tunnel syndrome. US may be appropriate in cases where this initial evaluation is equivocal.  
MRI Wrist  
Historically, carpal tunnel syndrome has been diagnosed based on clinical signs and sympt oms and confirmed by 
the results of electrodiagnostic studies [67]. MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in cases in which this  
initial evaluation is equivocal. The MRI findings that have been reported in wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome —
including nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing—may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value 
in patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68].

or ultrasound (US) may be indicated  [7-10]. 
Successful treatment of distal radius fractures requires restoration of radial length, inclination, and tilt, as well as 
the realignment of the articular fracture fragments [9,11]. The presence of a coronally  oriented fracture line, die -
punch depression, or more than three articular fracture fragments are common indications for operative reduction 
[8]. Operative fixation resulting in < 2 mm of residual articular surface step-off is usually considered necessary to 
avoid long-term complications , such as osteoarthritis [9 ,12]. 
Discussion of Procedures by Variant  
Variant 1: Acute blunt or penetrating trauma to the hand or wrist. Initial imaging.  
Radiograph y Area of Interest  
Radiography is  always indicated as the initial imaging for suspected acute hand and wrist trauma.  For m ost joints 
of the extremities, especially those involving the wrist, hand, and fingers, a radiographic examination that 
includes only 2 views is not adequate for detecting fractures [13]. For patients with suspected  distal radius 
fractures, a 3-view examination  of the wrist  usually includes a posteroanterior (PA) , a lateral, and a 45° 
semi pronated oblique view  [11]. One study [ 14] reports that a fourth projection—a semisupinated oblique —
increases diagnostic yield for distal radius fractures.  
A standard 3 -view radiographic examination of the hand shows most fractures and dislocations of the metacarpals 
and phalanges [ 13]. For phalangeal injuries, some centers include a PA examination of the entire hand, whereas 
others limit the examination to the injured finger.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 5 Acute Hand and Wrist Trauma  Most fractures of the thumb are visible on a 2-view radiographic examination, although there is a slight increase 
in dia gnostic yield with the addition of an oblique projection [ 13], which can be obtained along with a PA 
examination of the whole hand.  
In patients with suspected finger tendon injuries, radiographs are used to detect fracture fragments, as large 
fragments may require open reduction and internal fixation.  Radiographs are usually sufficient for  the evaluation 
of osseous “mallet” injuries, which include bony avulsion at the insertion of the extensor mechanism of the finger 
to the distal interphalangeal joint [16]. In these injuries, involvement of more than one -third of the articular 
surface usually requires operative fixation.  Palmar displacement of the distal phalanx or an interfragmentary gap 
of >3 mm is also an indication for surgery [ 16]. With extensor tendon injuries, radiographs are commonly used to 
assess for bone involve ment and determine need for operative fixation [ 17]. 
CT Area of Interest  
In patients with intra -articular fractures seen on radiography , CT shows articular fracture fragment displacement, 
depression, and comminution more accurately than conventional radiographs [ 7,9,10]. CT measurements of 
articular surface gap and step -off are more reproducible than radiographs [7]. The addition of 3- D surface -
rendered reconstructions to the standard 2 -D CT images has been shown to change operative management in up to 
48% of intra -articular distal radius fractures [8]. 
There is no evidence to support the use of CT with intravenous  (IV) contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist 
trauma.

A Stener lesion occurs when the aponeurosis of the adductor pollicis muscle becomes interposed between the 
ruptured ulnar collateral ligament of the thumb and its site  of insertion at the base of the proximal phalanx. This 
lesion can be identified by absence of ulnar collateral ligament and the presence of a hypoechoic mass proximal to 
the apex of the metacarpal tubercle [64]. Dynamic examination shows the relationship of the aponeurosis to the

Page Content: A new inability to bear weight is a 
clinically suspicious finding , although the sensitivity and specificity of this is unknown  [20]. Allowing for 
variation between studies, the estimated prev alence of occult fracture after negative radiographs has  been 
estimated  at 4% to 10% , indicating the inability of negative radiographs alone to exclude fracture [21,26] . Risk 
factors for radiographically occult fracture in these studies included those age >65, low -force trauma,  such as a 
ground-level fall , and female gender. These studies have almost exclusively included elderly patients.  There is no 
relevant literature regarding the sensitivity and specificity of radiographs in the younger patient population,  and 
clinicians are suggested to proceed with caution.  
Radiography Pelvis  
There is no specific literature  regarding the use of an AP view of the pelvis  alone  for acute hip pain following 
low-force trauma.  Previous literature regarding the accuracy of radiography has almost exclusively evaluated AP 
and cross-table lateral radiographs of the hip or the combined use of AP pelvis and hip radiographs. However, i t is 
well established that patients with clinically  suspected proximal femur fracture often have fractures of the pelvis,  
including the sacrum and pubic rami [21,27-30] . Therefore , it has been  recommended that the radiographic series 
include the AP view of the pelvis along with the orthogonal  views  of the symptomatic hip [31] . The inclusion of a 
pelvis radiograph also allows for comparison of potential abnormalities to the contralateral asymptomatic side.  
Pelvis radiographs share the same limitations in sensitivity  and specificity  for fracture detection as hip 
radiographs , and a negative radiograph alone cannot exclude fracture . 
Radiography Pelvis and Hip 
As previously discussed, p atients with clinically suspected proximal femur fracture often have fractures of the 
pelvis  that includ e the sacrum and pubic rami [21,27- 30]. Moreover, these pelvic fractures may occur in isolation 
or concomitant with a fracture of the proximal femur [28].

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  hip pain is a common chief  complaint  for patients , reportedly affecting  30% to 40% of adults  who play 
sports  [1,2] , and 12% to 15% of all adults  over 60 [3,4] . A wide variety  of pathological  entities  may cause hip pain, 
including  osseous  as well as intra- or extra -articular  soft tissue abnormalities  [5-7]. Pathology  involving  the lumbar  
spine,  sacroiliac,  or knee  joints  can also cause hip pain [8], and these  etiologies  should  be investigated  as needed . 
There is limited  original  research  that specifically  targets the imaging  of chronic  hip pain,  but imaging  of specific  
conditions  is widely  discussed  in the published  literature. 
Before  imaging,  an appropriate  assessment  of a patient’s  clinical  history  and physical  examination  is essential  in 
trying  to pare down the range  of possible etiologies  for a patient’s  symptoms.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 6 Acute Hip Pain -Suspected Fracture  Bone Scan H ips 
Prior to the advent of MRI, a bone scan was the preferred test for radiographically occult proximal femoral 
fractures. However, as early as 1993 , Rizzo et al [50] demonstrated MRI to be at least as accurate as bone scan s 
and with substantially decreased time to diagnosis. A later study by  Rubin et al [51] comparing bone scan s and 
MRI demonstrated i mproved sensitivity and specificity of MRI relative to bone scans . Moreover, t he bone scan 
group averaged an additional day to surgery.  
Bone scintigraphy is a time-consuming process. Bone scans may be falsely negative for up to 72 hours from the 
time of in jury, and false-positive scans are likewise common, related to osteoarthritis, soft -tissue injury , or any 
other process that may increase bone turnover [50] . It has been postulated that performing single -photon emission 
computed tomography may combine the sensitivity of bone scintig raphy with the spatial accuracy of CT , but there 
are no data to support this view. In current practice, the role of bone scan s as a secondary line of imaging in 
patients with contraindications to MRI has largely been usurped by CT.  
Summary of Recommendations 
• Variant 1:  Radiographs  of the hip, radiographs  of the pelvis, or radiographs  of the pelvis and hips is usually 
appropriate for the initial imaging of the hip with acute pain, fall or minor trauma, and suspected fracture.  
• Variant 2:  MRI pelv is and affected hip without IV contrast  or CT pelvis and hips without IV contrast is 
usually appropriate as the next imaging study for the evaluation of a cute hip pain from a fall or minor trauma  
with negative radiographs  and suspected fracture.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Fractures of the proximal femur (commonly referred to as hip fractures)  are a frequent  source of morbidity and 
mortality in elderly osteoporotic patients [1]. Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type 
result in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men 
[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs 
will continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of 
life following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays 
in diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -
and long-term mortality [6-13]. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of hip fractures is critical. Hip fractures 
cannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded on the basis of physical exam ination  alone ; therefore , imaging plays a 
key role in early  and accurate diagnosis [14] .",False

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Fractures of the proximal femur (commonly referred to as hip fractures)  are a frequent  source of morbidity and 
mortality in elderly osteoporotic patients [1]. Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type 
result in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men 
[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs 
will continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of 
life following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays 
in diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -
and long-term mortality [6-13]. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of hip fractures is critical. Hip fractures 
cannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded on the basis of physical exam ination  alone ; therefore , imaging plays a 
key role in early  and accurate diagnosis [14] .

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 6 Acute Hip Pain -Suspected Fracture  Bone Scan H ips 
Prior to the advent of MRI, a bone scan was the preferred test for radiographically occult proximal femoral 
fractures. However, as early as 1993 , Rizzo et al [50] demonstrated MRI to be at least as accurate as bone scan s 
and with substantially decreased time to diagnosis. A later study by  Rubin et al [51] comparing bone scan s and 
MRI demonstrated i mproved sensitivity and specificity of MRI relative to bone scans . Moreover, t he bone scan 
group averaged an additional day to surgery.  
Bone scintigraphy is a time-consuming process. Bone scans may be falsely negative for up to 72 hours from the 
time of in jury, and false-positive scans are likewise common, related to osteoarthritis, soft -tissue injury , or any 
other process that may increase bone turnover [50] . It has been postulated that performing single -photon emission 
computed tomography may combine the sensitivity of bone scintig raphy with the spatial accuracy of CT , but there 
are no data to support this view. In current practice, the role of bone scan s as a secondary line of imaging in 
patients with contraindications to MRI has largely been usurped by CT.  
Summary of Recommendations 
• Variant 1:  Radiographs  of the hip, radiographs  of the pelvis, or radiographs  of the pelvis and hips is usually 
appropriate for the initial imaging of the hip with acute pain, fall or minor trauma, and suspected fracture.  
• Variant 2:  MRI pelv is and affected hip without IV contrast  or CT pelvis and hips without IV contrast is 
usually appropriate as the next imaging study for the evaluation of a cute hip pain from a fall or minor trauma  
with negative radiographs  and suspected fracture.

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  hip pain is a common chief  complaint  for patients , reportedly affecting  30% to 40% of adults  who play 
sports  [1,2] , and 12% to 15% of all adults  over 60 [3,4] . A wide variety  of pathological  entities  may cause hip pain, 
including  osseous  as well as intra- or extra -articular  soft tissue abnormalities  [5-7]. Pathology  involving  the lumbar  
spine,  sacroiliac,  or knee  joints  can also cause hip pain [8], and these  etiologies  should  be investigated  as needed . 
There is limited  original  research  that specifically  targets the imaging  of chronic  hip pain,  but imaging  of specific  
conditions  is widely  discussed  in the published  literature. 
Before  imaging,  an appropriate  assessment  of a patient’s  clinical  history  and physical  examination  is essential  in 
trying  to pare down the range  of possible etiologies  for a patient’s  symptoms.

Page Content: A new inability to bear weight is a 
clinically suspicious finding , although the sensitivity and specificity of this is unknown  [20]. Allowing for 
variation between studies, the estimated prev alence of occult fracture after negative radiographs has  been 
estimated  at 4% to 10% , indicating the inability of negative radiographs alone to exclude fracture [21,26] . Risk 
factors for radiographically occult fracture in these studies included those age >65, low -force trauma,  such as a 
ground-level fall , and female gender. These studies have almost exclusively included elderly patients.  There is no 
relevant literature regarding the sensitivity and specificity of radiographs in the younger patient population,  and 
clinicians are suggested to proceed with caution.  
Radiography Pelvis  
There is no specific literature  regarding the use of an AP view of the pelvis  alone  for acute hip pain following 
low-force trauma.  Previous literature regarding the accuracy of radiography has almost exclusively evaluated AP 
and cross-table lateral radiographs of the hip or the combined use of AP pelvis and hip radiographs. However, i t is 
well established that patients with clinically  suspected proximal femur fracture often have fractures of the pelvis,  
including the sacrum and pubic rami [21,27-30] . Therefore , it has been  recommended that the radiographic series 
include the AP view of the pelvis along with the orthogonal  views  of the symptomatic hip [31] . The inclusion of a 
pelvis radiograph also allows for comparison of potential abnormalities to the contralateral asymptomatic side.  
Pelvis radiographs share the same limitations in sensitivity  and specificity  for fracture detection as hip 
radiographs , and a negative radiograph alone cannot exclude fracture . 
Radiography Pelvis and Hip 
As previously discussed, p atients with clinically suspected proximal femur fracture often have fractures of the 
pelvis  that includ e the sacrum and pubic rami [21,27- 30]. Moreover, these pelvic fractures may occur in isolation 
or concomitant with a fracture of the proximal femur [28].",True

CT with IV contrast is not ind icated in this scenario because soft-tissue abnormalities and fluid collections can be 
identified on noncontr ast high -resolution CT studies. 
MRI Ankle  
MRI of the ankle without IV contrast is most sensitive for evaluation of occult fractures with associated bone 
marrow edema patterns, particularly in inversion injuries and persistent lateral ankle pain, as well  as presence and 
extent of soft -tissue injuries  [29]. Stress injuries of bone , including those of the weekend warrior , are best depicted 
by MRI  [50]. 
MRI is the reference standard for ligamentous injury and assessment of stability , which is particularly important in 
athletes, in whom determination of grade ( 1, 2, or 3) of syndesmotic ligament, anterior tibiofibular ligament , and 
deltoid injuries is critical for treatment planning and return to sport assessment [51]. High -resolution evaluation of 
the tendons and ligaments allows distinction between tendinopathy, sprain, and partial or complete tears.  
Ligament and tendon  injuries can occur without fracture on radiography . Gross terlinden et al [52] compared MR I 
and radiography and showed that 15% of ligamentous injuries ( including sprains , partial tears, and complete tears) 
at the syndesmosis in acute ankle injuries on MRI demonstrated no fracture on radiography. Presence o f bone bruise 
and adjacent soft -tissue edema have shown a higher association with acute ligamentous injuries ( anterior talofibular 
ligament most common) and tendon abnormalities [53,54]  in patients with negative radiographs.  MRI can also help 
exclude Salter 1 fractures in the pediatric population [55].

Stress views are not routinely used for the evaluation of suspected tendon abnormality.  
Variant 5: Chronic ankle pain. Ankle radiographs normal or nonspecific, suspected ankle instability. Next study . 
In the absence of findings on routine radiography, imaging options to evaluate ligamentous integrity include stress radiography, MRI, MR arthrography, CT arthrography, and US.  
MRI  
One study eva luating anterior talofibular ligament injury demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy of 97% for MRI 
when compared to arthroscopic findings. Additionally, MRI identified the exact location of the injury in 93% of 
the cases [15].  Comparing MRI with arthroscopy, studies have shown a range of accuracies of chronic lateral 
ligament tearing (either partial or complete), ranging from 77 % to 92% for the anterior talofibular ligament and 
88% to 92% for the calcaneofibular ligament [14, 52]. For the evaluation of deep deltoid ligament tears, MRI is 
both sensitive and specific compared with arthroscopy, with reported values of 96% and 98%, respectively [53].  
With regard to tears of the tibiofibular ligaments of the tibiofibular syndesmosis, MRI has a reported accuracy of 100% [54]. Additionally, MRI can also demonstrate interosseous membrane tears [55]. MRI offers the advantage 
of evaluating for injuries associated with or mimicking lateral instability that may not be diagnosed on stress radiography such as tenosynovitis, tendon injury, and osteochondral lesions [56]. MRI may also be used to evaluate the ankle after lateral ligament reconstruction [57].  
MR Arthrography  
MR arthrography can be helpful for the assessment of chronic ankle instability due to lateral collateral ligament injuries [12].  
US 
One study evaluating anterior talofibular ligamen t injury demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy of 91% for US when 
compared to arthroscopic findings.

subtalar motion after a period of immobilizat ion [49]. 
CT with IV contrast is not ind icated in this scenario because soft-tissue abnormalities and fluid collections can be 
identified on noncontr ast high -resolution CT studies. 
MRI Ankle  
MRI of the ankle without IV contrast is most sensitive for evaluation of occult fractures with associated bone 
marrow edema patterns, particularly in inversion injuries and persistent lateral ankle pain, as well  as presence and 
extent of soft -tissue injuries  [29]. Stress injuries of bone , including those of the weekend warrior , are best depicted 
by MRI  [50]. 
MRI is the reference standard for ligamentous injury and assessment of stability , which is particularly important in 
athletes, in whom determination of grade ( 1, 2, or 3) of syndesmotic ligament, anterior tibiofibular ligament , and 
deltoid injuries is critical for treatment planning and return to sport assessment [51]. High -resolution evaluation of 
the tendons and ligaments allows distinction between tendinopathy, sprain, and partial or complete tears.  
Ligament and tendon  injuries can occur without fracture on radiography . Gross terlinden et al [52] compared MR I 
and radiography and showed that 15% of ligamentous injuries ( including sprains , partial tears, and complete tears) 
at the syndesmosis in acute ankle injuries on MRI demonstrated no fracture on radiography. Presence o f bone bruise 
and adjacent soft -tissue edema have shown a higher association with acute ligamentous injuries ( anterior talofibular 
ligament most common) and tendon abnormalities [53,54]  in patients with negative radiographs.  MRI can also help 
exclude Salter 1 fractures in the pediatric population [55].

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 9 Chronic Ankle Pain  Radiography 
Stress views are not routinely used for the evaluation of suspected tendon abnormality.  
Variant 5: Chronic ankle pain. Ankle radiographs normal or nonspecific, suspected ankle instability. Next study . 
In the absence of findings on routine radiography, imaging options to evaluate ligamentous integrity include stress radiography, MRI, MR arthrography, CT arthrography, and US.  
MRI  
One study eva luating anterior talofibular ligament injury demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy of 97% for MRI 
when compared to arthroscopic findings. Additionally, MRI identified the exact location of the injury in 93% of 
the cases [15].  Comparing MRI with arthroscopy, studies have shown a range of accuracies of chronic lateral 
ligament tearing (either partial or complete), ranging from 77 % to 92% for the anterior talofibular ligament and 
88% to 92% for the calcaneofibular ligament [14, 52]. For the evaluation of deep deltoid ligament tears, MRI is 
both sensitive and specific compared with arthroscopy, with reported values of 96% and 98%, respectively [53].  
With regard to tears of the tibiofibular ligaments of the tibiofibular syndesmosis, MRI has a reported accuracy of 100% [54]. Additionally, MRI can also demonstrate interosseous membrane tears [55]. MRI offers the advantage 
of evaluating for injuries associated with or mimicking lateral instability that may not be diagnosed on stress radiography such as tenosynovitis, tendon injury, and osteochondral lesions [56]. MRI may also be used to evaluate the ankle after lateral ligament reconstruction [57].  
MR Arthrography  
MR arthrography can be helpful for the assessment of chronic ankle instability due to lateral collateral ligament injuries [12].  
US 
One study evaluating anterior talofibular ligamen t injury demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy of 91% for US when 
compared to arthroscopic findings.

athletes, in whom determination of grade (1, 2,  or 3) of syndesmotic ligament, anterior tibiofibular ligament , and 
deltoid injuries is critica l for treatment planning and return to sport assessment [51] .

the syndesmosis in acute ankle injuries on M RI demonstra ted no fracture on radiography.  
Rare pantalar dislocations without associated talar or other fracture can be assessed on CT or MRI and have high 
rates of osteonecrosis, osteoarthritis, and infection  [71]. 
Radiography Ankle Stress Views  
Stress radiograph s may be useful in assessing syndesmotic instability, particularly in supination external rotation 
ankle injuries according to the Lauge -Hansen classification. Lee et al [72]  noted that tibiotalar tilt angle and anterior 
tibiofibular space measurements were affected when the anterior tibiofibular and posterior talofibular ligaments 
were injured (confirmed on MRI) in 299 patients . Lateral stress testing with widening of the tibiofibular clear space 
has been shown to be  an indicator of syndesmotic injury , with the traditional external rotation stress test shown to 
be a poor indicator when t he deltoid ligament is injured [73] .

The Broden view is a supine  flexed knee view with 30 ° to 45° internal rotation that  can be used  for specific improved 
evaluation of the lateral process fracture of the talus (commonly known as snowboarder’s fracture). It may be of

Variant 6 : Adult or child 5 years of age or older. Acute trauma to the ankle. Radiographs negative for osseous 
injury and physical examination or radiographs demonstrate alignment abnormality  suggesting 
syndesmotic/ligamentous injury or dislocation. Next study. 
Lateral sprain is more common than medial strain , with the anterior talofibular ligament most commonly tor n. High 
sprain and fractures are more common in high -collision sport injuries [60], with higher incidence of ankle injuries 
during winter months [67] and increased incidence in military recruits [68]. Inversion injuries of the ankle account 
for 25% of musculoskeletal system injuries and 50% of all sports -related injuries [1].  
Bone Scan Ankle  
Bone scan is not routinely the next line of imaging in this clinical scenario.  
CT Ankle  
CT is useful for evaluation of dislocation and can be used to detect  syndesmotic injuries, although MRI is better for 
soft-tissue evaluation. Nault et al [69]  validated CT scan measurement s that  can identify syndesmotic injuries seen 
on MRI (retrosp ective study of MRI and CT) as a result of  modification of distal tibiofibular relationship after a 
mild syndesmotic injury.

Page Content: Radiography Foot  with  Weightbearing  
If there are clinical  signs  of a Lisfranc  injury , obtaining  weight bearing  radiographs  is recommended  when  
possible  because nonweightbearing  radiographs  are not reliable  for detection  of subtle  injuries.  Weightbearing  
views have  been  shown  to increase the abnormal  alignment  at the Lisfranc joint, thus making it easier  to identify  a 
Lisfranc injury  [16,19] . The inclusion  of both feet on AP radiographs  can help in the detection  of subtle  
malalignment  when  compared  with the uninjured side [20]. 
CT Foot  
CT is commonly used in evaluating  the true extent  of osseous injury  in complex fractures and at times  is used as 
the initial imaging  study  in polytrauma  patients  and in complex  regions  such as the midfoot  [21,22] . CT is not

Lisfranc  Injury  
MRI has been  advocated  as a sensitive diagnostic  test in evaluation  of Lisfranc ligamentous  complex  (especially  
if the patient  is not able to bear weight),  and 3-D volumetric  acquisitions  have  proven superiority  over orthogonal  
proton  density  fat-suppressed  imaging [33,38,41- 45]. There is a high correlation  between  MRI and intraoperative  
findings  for an unstable  Lisfranc injury  [44]. In the patient  with a suspected  Lisfranc injury  and normal

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 12 Acute  Trauma  to the Knee  Variant  7: Adult  or child 5 years of age or older . Significant  trauma  to the knee  (eg, motor  vehicle  accident,  
knee  dislocation). Initial imaging.  
Arteriography  Lower Extremity  
Vascular  injury  may be found in about  30% of patients  following  posterior  knee  dislocation  [56]. Injuries  of the 
popliteal artery  require  prompt  surgical  intervention to help limb preservation . Associated  peroneal  and tibial nerve  
injuries  may cause significant  morbidity and require  an understanding of their pathophysiologic  implications  to 
maximize  limb functionality  [57]. Angiography  has been  the reference standard  in the evaluation  of vascular  injuries  
associated  with knee  dislocations  [58]. However,  this is an invasive  procedure  with associated  risk, and with the 
excellent  performance of CTA and MRA, it is usually  performed  in selected  cases  [58]. 
CT Knee  
CT is not routinely  used as the initial imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the knee.  CT is superior  
to knee  radiographs  in detection  and classification  of fractures [12]; however,  without  IV contrast , CT cannot  detect  
vascular  injuries. 
CTA Lower Extremity  
With  suspected  vascular  injuries  in the setting  of knee  dislocation, CTA  is frequently  used because it is less invasive  
and has a similar ly high accuracy  as conventional  angiography [58-60]. 
MR Arthrography  Knee  
In patients  with significant  acute knee  trauma  with suspected  or possible  dislocation , MR arthrography  of the knee 
is not routinely used as the initial imaging  study.

Page Content: MRI with and without IV contrast is indicated when performing semiquantitative assessment of knee 
osteoarthritis using various scoring systems to include cartilage, synovitis, ligaments, BMLs , and menisci [18].  In 
obese patients with osteoarthritis on contrast -enhanced images, increased perfusion in Hoffa’s fat is associated 
with more severe anterior knee pain [59 ].  
MR Arthrography  Knee  
MR arthrography is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with osteoarthritis or chondrocalcinosis.  
US Knee  
US is not often useful as a screening test or a comprehensive examination.  US can detect synovial pathology, 
effusions , and cortical erosive changes [11]. Power Doppler US  can demonstrate increased synovial blood flow 
that is associated with knee pain and can demonstrat e reduced blood flow , which correlates with reduced knee 
pain following joint injections [60]. US can also demonstrate meniscal extrusion , a finding th at suggests an 
underlying meniscal tear , and , on occasion , chondrocalcinosis and peripheral meniscal tears [11].  
Bone Scan Knee  
Radionuclide bone scan  is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with chronic knee pain given the low 
specificity and decreased anatomic resolution compared to CT or MRI [11].  However, i t may help distinguish 
between bone and soft -tissue origins for pain as well as localize pain to one or more joints [11].  
Image -Guided Aspiration Knee  
If an effusion is present, US - or fluoroscopically guided joint aspiration can be performed for synovial fluid 
analysis if there is concern for crystal disease or infection.  Corticosteroid injections can also be performed as they 
may result in a 1  to 2 week reduction in synovitis on MR I in two -thirds of patients. MRI also demonstrates a 
subsequent increase in the synovial volume in approximately 70% of patients that develop recurrent pain [61 ].

Page Content: In this study , multidetector  CT showed a low sensitivity  for other  soft-
tissue injuries  at the knee;  however,  its high specificity  indicated  that apparent  posterior  cruciate  ligament , meniscal,  
and collateral  ligament  tears can reliably  be treated  as true-positive  findings  [15]. 
The dual-energy  CT virtual  noncalcium  technique  can subtract  calcium  from  cancellous bone,  allowing  detection  
[16-18] and possibly grading of the post-traumatic  bone  marrow  contusions  [18]. 
However,  MRI is superior  to CT in detection  of bone  marrow  abnormalities  and meniscal  and ligamentous  injuries  
and may be subsequently  performed  as clinically  indicated. 
MR Arth rography  Knee  
With  negative radiographs,  MR arthrography  is not routinely  used as the next imaging study  for the evaluation  of 
suspected  occult  knee  fractures or internal  derangement . 
MRA Knee  
With  negative radiographs,  MRA  is not routinely  used as the next imaging study  for the evaluation  of suspected  
occult  knee  fractures or internal  derangement . 
MRI Knee  
MRI has many  distinct advantages for the evaluation  of the injured  knee  in the setting  of negative  radiographs.  
The majority  of patients  (93.5%)  who present  with acute  knee  injuries  in the emergency  department  sustained  soft-
tissue injuries  rather  than osseous injuries  [19].  MRI  is a proven valuable  tool in the treatment  decision -making  
process,  allowing  earlier  surgical  intervention  by obtaining  a more  accurate diagnosis  [20,21] . Frobell et al [22] 
reported  a low diagnostic  benefit  of the initial clinical  examination  in the setting  of acute knee  trauma  with higher -
than-suspected  incidence of the ACL  injuries  on MRI.

Bone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the 
subchondral bone.  New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or 
patients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee 
pain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the 
origin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. 
Subchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed 
spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to 
elderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs 
often initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, 
and progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is 
suspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria
® 
topic on “ Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae ” [28]. 
Some patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using 
quantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs 
exhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ].

therapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. 
Other etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat

capsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes ,

Summary of Literature Review  
Background/Introduction 
Chronic knee pain affects tens of millions of people  in the United States annually , with the pain sometimes highly 
disabling and often negatively impacting the patient’s quality of life. Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and 
it can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain 
with the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. 
Typically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain 
persists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  
imaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated 
that approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the 
prior year) radiographs [2 ]. 
This document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  ≥5 years of age.

Bone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the 
subchondral bone.  New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or 
patients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee 
pain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the 
origin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. 
Subchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed 
spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to 
elderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs 
often initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, 
and progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is 
suspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria
® 
topic on “ Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae ” [28]. 
Some patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using 
quantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs 
exhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ].

Bone Scan Foot  
There is no relevant literature  to support t he use of nuclear medicine studies as the first imaging  study  in the 
evaluation of chronic foot pain.  
CT Foot  
There is no relevant literature to support the use of CT as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot

MRI Foot  
There is no r elevant literature  to support the use of MRI as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot

Radiography Foot  
Conventional radiography can be useful to distinguish among different causes of chronic foot pain and is usually 
the first imag ing study in evaluating patients with chronic foot pain.  
The value of radiographs in the diagnosis of tarsal coalitions has been extensively demonstrated. Overall 
sensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs 
in the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral 
and oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar 
coalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs 
on the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have 
been found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable 
methods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  
Radiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review 
by Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for 
radiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.

In the absence of findings on routine radiography, imaging options to evaluate ligamentous integrity include stress radiography, MRI, MR arthrography, CT arthrography, and US.  
MRI  
One study eva luating anterior talofibular ligament injury demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy of 97% for MRI 
when compared to arthroscopic findings. Additionally, MRI identified the exact location of the injury in 93% of 
the cases [15].  Comparing MRI with arthroscopy, studies have shown a range of accuracies of chronic lateral 
ligament tearing (either partial or complete), ranging from 77 % to 92% for the anterior talofibular ligament and 
88% to 92% for the calcaneofibular ligament [14, 52]. For the evaluation of deep deltoid ligament tears, MRI is 
both sensitive and specific compared with arthroscopy, with reported values of 96% and 98%, respectively [53].  
With regard to tears of the tibiofibular ligaments of the tibiofibular syndesmosis, MRI has a reported accuracy of 100% [54]. Additionally, MRI can also demonstrate interosseous membrane tears [55]. MRI offers the advantage 
of evaluating for injuries associated with or mimicking lateral instability that may not be diagnosed on stress radiography such as tenosynovitis, tendon injury, and osteochondral lesions [56]. MRI may also be used to evaluate the ankle after lateral ligament reconstruction [57].  
MR Arthrography  
MR arthrography can be helpful for the assessment of chronic ankle instability due to lateral collateral ligament injuries [12].

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Ankle pain is considered chronic when symptoms persist > 6 weeks. Chronic ankle  pain can be caused by a variety 
of osseous or soft -tissue abnormalities, either alone or in combination. For assessing chronic ankle pain, there are 
multiple imaging options, including radiography, stress radiography,  computed tomography (CT)  radionuclide 
bone scanning, ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and various injection procedures. Injection 
proce dures include arthrography, CT arthrography, MR arthrography, and diagnostic injection with anesthetic 
agents. Although there are numerous causes for chronic ankle pain, common etiologies include osteoarthritis, 
osteochondral injury, tendon abnormalities, ligament abnormalities and instability, and impingement.  
Overview of Imaging Modalities  
Radiography Radiographs can provide information about the osseous and soft -tissue structures about the ankle. Routine 
radiographs of the ankle typically include anteroposterior, lateral, and mortise views, the latter obtained by internally rotating the foot 15 to 20 degrees.

Discussion of Procedures  by Variant  
Variant 1: Chronic ankle pain. Initial imaging . 
Radiography 
Radiography should be considered as the initial imaging study . Radiographs may reveal osteoarthritis, calcified or 
ossif ied intra -articular bodies, osteochondral abnormalities, stress fractures,  or evidence of prior trauma. Ankle 
effusions may also be identified in the anterior ankle joint recess by radiography with 53% to 74% accuracy  [19]. 
They are often associated with ligamentous injury or fracture [19]. The presence of ossific fragments can indicate 
ligamentous injury or retinaculum avulsion [20], whereas periostitis can occur adjacent to tenosynovitis. 
Radiographs can also identify synovial osteochondromatosis and erosions from chronic synovitis.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Ankle pain is considered chronic when symptoms persist > 6 weeks. Chronic ankle  pain can be caused by a variety 
of osseous or soft -tissue abnormalities, either alone or in combination. For assessing chronic ankle pain, there are 
multiple imaging options, including radiography, stress radiography,  computed tomography (CT)  radionuclide 
bone scanning, ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and various injection procedures. Injection 
proce dures include arthrography, CT arthrography, MR arthrography, and diagnostic injection with anesthetic 
agents. Although there are numerous causes for chronic ankle pain, common etiologies include osteoarthritis, 
osteochondral injury, tendon abnormalities, ligament abnormalities and instability, and impingement.  
Overview of Imaging Modalities  
Radiography Radiographs can provide information about the osseous and soft -tissue structures about the ankle. Routine 
radiographs of the ankle typically include anteroposterior, lateral, and mortise views, the latter obtained by internally rotating the foot 15 to 20 degrees.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 8 Chronic Wrist Pain  abnormalities responsible for pain when there is no ligament or TFCC abnormality. Because of these limitations, 
arthrography  has now largely been supplanted by cross-sectional imaging. Fluoroscopic -guided intra -articular 
injections are chiefly used as a first step when performing arthrographic  computed tomography ( CT) and 
magnetic resonance imaging (MR I) studies [8]. 
MRI  
Wrist MRI accurately depicts abnormalities of the bones and bone marrow, articular cartilage, intrinsic and 
extrinsic ligaments, TFCC, synovium, tendons, and neurovascular structures, making it a powerful study for 
chronic pai n caused by diverse etiologies.  
A dedicated receiver coil or transmit -receive coil is necessary to provide the signal -to-noise ratio needed for high-
resolution, high-contrast MRI of the wrist [9 ]. MR arthrography —either with direct contrast injection into one  or 
more wrist compartments or performed indirectly after intravenous (IV) contrast administration —can enhance the 
yield of the study for diagnosing internal wrist derangements, especially abnormalities of the ligaments, articular cartilage, and TFCC of the wrist. MRI performed with a 3.0 T magnet and a dedicated coil provides better signal -
to-noise ratio and better contrast compared with wrist MR I performed with 1.5 T  or lower field strength systems 
[10,11]. 
CT 
CT of the wr ist is used primarily when high-det ail imaging of bone cortex or trabeculae is needed. In patients with 
chronic wrist pain and prior fractures, CT is typically the study of choice to evaluate fracture healing and joint 
congruence. When a radiographically occult fracture is suspected as the cause of a patient’s chronic pain, either 
CT or MRI can be used [12]. Advantages of CT over MRI for the wrist include  its ability to obtain high -resolution 
images of both wrists simultaneously and the much shorter acquisition times for CT.

Variant 5: Chronic ankle pain. Ankle radiographs normal or nonspecific, suspected ankle instability. Next study . 
In the absence of findings on routine radiography, imaging options to evaluate ligamentous integrity include stress radiography, MRI, MR arthrography, CT arthrography, and US.  
MRI  
One study eva luating anterior talofibular ligament injury demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy of 97% for MRI 
when compared to arthroscopic findings. Additionally, MRI identified the exact location of the injury in 93% of 
the cases [15].  Comparing MRI with arthroscopy, studies have shown a range of accuracies of chronic lateral 
ligament tearing (either partial or complete), ranging from 77 % to 92% for the anterior talofibular ligament and 
88% to 92% for the calcaneofibular ligament [14, 52]. For the evaluation of deep deltoid ligament tears, MRI is 
both sensitive and specific compared with arthroscopy, with reported values of 96% and 98%, respectively [53].  
With regard to tears of the tibiofibular ligaments of the tibiofibular syndesmosis, MRI has a reported accuracy of 100% [54]. Additionally, MRI can also demonstrate interosseous membrane tears [55]. MRI offers the advantage 
of evaluating for injuries associated with or mimicking lateral instability that may not be diagnosed on stress radiography such as tenosynovitis, tendon injury, and osteochondral lesions [56]. MRI may also be used to evaluate the ankle after lateral ligament reconstruction [57].  
MR Arthrography  
MR arthrography can be helpful for the assessment of chronic ankle instability due to lateral collateral ligament injuries [12].  
US 
One study evaluating anterior talofibular ligamen t injury demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy of 91% for US when 
compared to arthroscopic findings.

Radiography 
Radiography should be considered as the initial imaging study . Radiographs may reveal osteoarthritis, calcified or 
ossif ied intra -articular bodies, osteochondral abnormalities, stress fractures,  or evidence of prior trauma. Ankle 
effusions may also be identified in the anterior ankle joint recess by radiography with 53% to 74% accuracy  [19]. 
They are often associated with ligamentous injury or fracture [19]. The presence of ossific fragments can indicate 
ligamentous injury or retinaculum avulsion [20], whereas periostitis can occur adjacent to tenosynovitis. 
Radiographs can also identify synovial osteochondromatosis and erosions from chronic synovitis.

Additionally,  a more  distal  ligamentous  insertion  of the UCL  (T sign)  has recently  been  suggested  to result  from  
repetitive  overhead  activity  and injury  rather  than representing  a normal  anatomic variant  [42]. 
In patients  with posterolateral  rotatory instability, MR arthrography can assess the integrity  of the ulnar  band  of the 
radial  collateral  ligament  [43] and demonstrate radiocapitellar  incongruity [44]. 
MRI Elbow  
A 3T MR arthrography is more  accurate than noncontrast  MRI elbow  for detection  of collateral  ligament  injuries  
[38]. 
Radiography Elbow  Stress View  
Measurement  of medial  joint space opening on stress radiographs  correlates  with severity  of UCL  injury  in throwing

MRI is ideal for evaluating tendon injuries and helping with surgical planning [58, 59]. MRI is comm only used for 
the diagnosis of  Stener lesions of the thumb [60] and the diagnosis of pulley system injuries [61]. 
Hergan et al [62] reported a 100% sensitivity and specificity for assessment of thumb ulnar collateral ligament 
tears. Spaeth et al [ 63] reported a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 94% for detection of displaced ulnar 
collateral ligament tears in 16 cadaveric specimens.  
US Hand  
A Stener lesion occurs when the aponeurosis of the adductor pollicis muscle becomes interposed between the 
ruptured ulnar collateral ligament of the thumb and its site  of insertion at the base of the proximal phalanx. This 
lesion can be identified by absence of ulnar collateral ligament and the presence of a hypoechoic mass proximal to 
the apex of the metacarpal tubercle [64]. Dynamic examination shows the relationship of the aponeurosis to the 
retracted ligament stump [65] . 
US allows for diagnosis of pulley system injuries [ 66,67]. 
Bone Scan Hand 
Bone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  
Variant 6: Initial radiographs showing metaca rpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, or distal 
interphalangeal joint malalignment in the absence of fracture. Next imaging study.  
CT Hand

MRI Hand  
MRI is ideal for evaluating tendon injuries and helping with surgical planning [58]. MRI may be used to assess 
capsule and collateral ligament injuries of the proximal interphalangeal  and metacarpophalangeal joints [68]. 
For flexor tendon injuries, Rubin et al [ 69] reported a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of  100% in cadavers.

Page Content: These factors make CT the 
preferred examination for suspected distal radioulnar joint subluxation, where images of both wrists can be  
obtained in both supination and pronation [1 ,13]. A disadvantage of CT  is its lower sensitivity to soft -tissue 
abnormalities  compared with MRI.  
High-resolution (typically multidetector) CT of the wrist following contrast injection into one or more wrist 
compartments (CT arthrography) is a powerful tool for diagnosing intra -articular abnormalities [14,15]. The 
intraobserver agreement on CT arthrogram images is extremely high and better than that reported for MRI 
[14,16]. 
US 
US of the wrist is useful for examining extra -articular soft tissues, such as suspected ganglion cyst s [17], because 
its accuracy is similar to that of MRI. US can also be used to diagnose abnormalities of the flexor and extensor 
tendons and tendon sheaths. For de Quervain disease (stenosing tenosynovitis of the abductor pollicis lon gus and 
extensor pollicis brevis tendon compartment), preoperative identification of a septum or subcompartmentalization 
within the first dorsal compartment with US  may affect surgical management [18 ,19]. 
In patients with suspected or established rheumatoid arthritis (RA), US examination of the wrist and selected 
finger joints can identify erosions and active synovit is (with the use of power Doppler), findings that influence 
early diagnosis and treatment decisions [20]. Using US to measure the size of the median nerve is a  validated  
technique in patients with clinical symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome [21-24].  
In addition, w rist US is a useful technique to guide therapeutic intr a-articular and other soft -tissue injections [25].

clinical response to a steroid injection in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome [70 ]. MR neurography

US Wrist 
Several meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the 
carpal  tunnel  inlet) is highly accurate for identifying carpal  tunnel syndrome  diagnosed clinically or with the 
combination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US 
varies depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the 
measurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary 
examination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel 
syndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal 
tunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, 
clinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of 
carpal tunnel syndrome. US may be appropriate in cases where this initial evaluation is equivocal.  
MRI Wrist  
Historically, carpal tunnel syndrome has been diagnosed based on clinical signs and sympt oms and confirmed by 
the results of electrodiagnostic studies [67]. MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in cases in which this  
initial evaluation is equivocal. The MRI findings that have been reported in wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome —
including nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing—may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value 
in patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68].",False

Variant 1: Chronic foot pain. Unknown etiology. Initial imaging.  
Bone Scan Foot  
There is no relevant literature  to support t he use of nuclear medicine studies as the first imaging  study  in the 
evaluation of chronic foot pain.  
CT Foot  
There is no relevant literature to support the use of CT as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot 
pain.  
MRI Foot  
There is no r elevant literature  to support the use of MRI as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot 
pain.  
Radiography Foot  
Conventional radiography can be useful to distinguish among different causes of chronic foot pain and is usually 
the first imag ing study in evaluating patients with chronic foot pain.  
The value of radiographs in the diagnosis of tarsal coalitions has been extensively demonstrated. Overall 
sensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs 
in the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral 
and oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar 
coalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs 
on the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have 
been found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable 
methods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  
Radiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review 
by Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for 
radiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.

diagnosis of CRPS type II, high-resolu tion US may have a role giving its increasing use in nerve assessment [23] . 
Variant 3: Chronic metatarsalgia including plantar great toe pain. Radiographs negative or equivocal. 
Clinical concern includes sesamoiditis, Morton’s  neuroma, intermetatarsal bursitis, chronic plantar plate 
injury, or Freiberg’s infraction. Next imaging study.  
Bone Scan Foot  
Planar b one scintigraphy has low anatomic resolution and has been shown to be a nonspecific technique to assess 
the hallucal sesamoids [24]. However, bone scintigraphy with single -photon emission computed tomography 
(SPECT)/CT increases contrast resolution and anatomic localization of foci with increased osteoblastic activity  
[25]. Bone scintigraphy may demonstrate increased uptake in pathologic conditions affecting the fir st metatarsal 
sesamoids not evident on radiographs. A less dramatic uptake is noted in stress fractures, which may be helpful to 
differentiate between them and acute fractures [26]. When an indeter minate linear lucency is visualized on 
radiographs, a negative bone scintigraphy suggest s sesamoid bipartition [12] . Other conditions that may present 
positive findings on Tc -99m -methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scint igraphy include sesamoiditis, 
inflammatory or deposition arthropathies, osteoarthritis , and osteonecrosis [39]. In Freiberg’s infraction, a 
photopenic center with a hyperactive collar may be identified on early stages on high -resolution Tc -99m -MDP bone 
scintigraphy [27]. 
CT Foot  
CT may be useful to confirm suspected sesamoid stress fractures on radiographs and to distinguish between a stress 
fracture and a bipartite sesamoid with more precision than conventional radiography [28] .

Page Content: Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  
usually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, 
osteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite 
versus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess 
with radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton’s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other 
causes of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg’s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals 
or soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . 
Though radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in 
patients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The 
combination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a 
specificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15]. 
US Foot  
Ultrasound (US) is usually not indicate d as the first imaging  study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain, but may 
be performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of pathologic conditions of the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, 
and other conditions such as tarsal tunnel syndrome, Morton’s  neuroma , plantar plate tears,  and intermetatarsal 
bursitis. 
Variant 2: Persistent posttraumatic foot pain. Radiographs negative or equivocal. Clinical concern includes 
complex regional pain syndrome type I. Next imaging study.  
3-Phase Bone Scan Foot  
A 3-phase bone scan may be useful in cases of suspected complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type I reflex 
sympathetic dystrophy , and several imaging findings have been described.

Introduction/Background 
Chronic foot pain is a frequent clinical complaint with approximately 14% to 42% of adults in the United States 
reporting foot problems, often with significant impact on mobility, difficulty performing daily activities , and 
increased risk of falling, particularly in older individuals [1,2] . Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a 
significant improvement in health-related quality of life with effective treatment of foot pain [3] . Estimating the 
prevalence of chron ic foot pain is challenging, because there is no consensus regarding the definition of chronic 
pain in the literature. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines chronic pain as any pain persisting 
past the normal healing time, suggesting 3 months in case of chronic pain of benign causes.  
Women are more commonly affected , and forefoot conditions are more frequent. Persistent pain for more than 6  
years has been reported in 51% of women between 70 to 75 years of age [4]. Because of  the wide range of causes 
of chronic foot pain, assessment of these patients with imaging studies in addition to a dedicated clinical

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 10 Chronic Wrist Pain  importantly, though, the finding of enhancing bone marrow “edema” (osteitis) on MRI studies in patients with 
early RA is proving to be the best single predictor of future disease progression and functional dete rioration, even 
compared to serologies and clinical measures [27, 28,32-34].  
US Wrist  
The diagnosis of a specific inflammatory arthritis is typically established based on clinical and laboratory 
analysis. Advanced imaging is usually performed to determine disease activity, guide management decisions, and prognosticate outcomes. In patients with RA, US  of the wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints can  show 
inflammation  as active synovitis. Identifying active synovitis with power Doppler assessment is a useful adjunct 
in making an early diagnosis of RA when a pati ent with early arthritis does not meet the 2010 criteria established 
by the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism [20]. The presence of 
synovitis predicts progression of erosions [31 ] and erosions themselves [35]. US can also depict small bone 
erosions with high spatial resolution; h owever, US is less sensitive to erosions that occur on the radial or ulnar 
sides of the inner carpal bones because direct scanning of these regions is blocked, unlike the dorsal and volar 
bone surfaces. Furthermore, unlike MRI, US cannot show changes within the bone marrow, which are  the 
strongest prognosticator s for disease progression in RA [27, 28,32-34].  In patients with established inflammatory 
arthritis who are undergoing therapy, judging progression or reduction of synovitis may be more difficult with 
sequential US compared to sequential MRI.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
MR arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected inflammatory 
arthritides. 
CT Wrist  
While CT is more sensitive than radiographs for erosions, CT is not routinely used for the diagnosis and 
management of patients with suspected inflammatory arthritides .

US has been  used to evaluate for osseous abnormalities  in the setting  of chronic  inflammatory  arthritis. Compared  
with radiography,  US has been  shown  to demonstrate a 6.5-fold  increase in the number  of detected  erosions of the

in detection  of metacarpophalangeal  joint erosions  has been  reported  as high as 29% [29]. Regardless,  large  erosions  
identified  with US at the second  and third  metacarpophalangeal  joints, the distal  ulna,  and the fifth 
metatarsophalangeal  joint are highly specific for and predictive  of RA [30]. US may also show  imaging  findings  
associated  with enthesitis  [25], with findings  of enthesitis  on power  Doppler  imaging  having  an accuracy  of 85.6% 
in distinguishing  peripheral  spondyloarthritis  versus nonspondyloarthropathy [31]. Studies  have  also found US to 
be helpful  in differentiating  RA and psoriatic  arthritis  [32,33] ; for example,  enthesitis  is a finding often  seen in 
spondyloarthritis  but not seen in RA. Increased  distance between  the nail and distal  phalanx in patients  with psoriatic

Radiography Foot  
Conventional radiography can be useful to distinguish among different causes of chronic foot pain and is usually 
the first imag ing study in evaluating patients with chronic foot pain.  
The value of radiographs in the diagnosis of tarsal coalitions has been extensively demonstrated. Overall 
sensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs 
in the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral 
and oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar 
coalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs 
on the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have 
been found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable 
methods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  
Radiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review 
by Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for 
radiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.

(SPECT)/CT increases contrast resolution and anatomic localization of foci with increased osteoblastic activity  
[25]. Bone scintigraphy may demonstrate increased uptake in pathologic conditions affecting the fir st metatarsal 
sesamoids not evident on radiographs. A less dramatic uptake is noted in stress fractures, which may be helpful to 
differentiate between them and acute fractures [26]. When an indeter minate linear lucency is visualized on 
radiographs, a negative bone scintigraphy suggest s sesamoid bipartition [12] . Other conditions that may present 
positive findings on Tc -99m -methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scint igraphy include sesamoiditis, 
inflammatory or deposition arthropathies, osteoarthritis , and osteonecrosis [39]. In Freiberg’s infraction, a 
photopenic center with a hyperactive collar may be identified on early stages on high -resolution Tc -99m -MDP bone 
scintigraphy [27].

There is no relevant literature  to support the routine use of CT in the evaluation of a patient with clinical suspicion 
of pathology of the plantar fascia.  
MRI Foot  
MRI allows accurate characterization of the pl antar fascia and adjacent soft -tissues and bones, and several imaging 
findin gs have been described in patients with plantar fasciitis and partial or complete tears of the plantar fascia on 
MRI [52]. Given that, some of the find ings in patients with plantar fasciitis are nonspecific; these findings can also 
be seen in asymptomatic patients.  MRI should always be correlated with clinical symptoms to avoid overcalling 
plantar fasciitis. Although no significant differences have been found in plantar fascia thickness on US and MRI, 
MRI is currently considered the most sensitive imaging study  in the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis [53]. There is no 
relevant literature supporting the routine use of contrast in the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis or tears.  
US Foot  
US has shown good sensitivity (80%) and specificity (88%) in the dia gnosis of plantar fasciitis when compared to 
MRI [54]. A diagnostic accuracy of 69% for abnormal focal echogenicity within the plantar fascia, 60% for edema 
around the plantar fascia, 78% for perifascial edema, 69% for rupture of the plantar fascia,  and 56% for an associated 
calcaneal spur have been found for US, using MRI as the reference standard [55]. Kapoor et al [56]  showed higher 
sensitivity and specificity of US elastography when compared to US in the detection of plantar fasciitis (95% and 
100% versus 66% and 75%, respectively) , using  MRI as the reference standard. US has been shown to be useful in 
the diagnosis of complete and partial tears of the plantar fascia [57].

Page Content: Compared to conventional MRI, CT arthrography may be more sensitive for tears of the biomechanically 
important dorsal ligament fibers [16]. In contrast to MRI and MR arthrography, CT arthrography is less sensitive 
for diagnosis of extra -articular findings (like ganglion cysts and tendon disorders) t hat can cause radial -sided pain.  
CT arthrography may be appropriate in this scenario.  
CT Wrist  
CT, with or without IV contrast,  is not routinely used to further evaluate chronic radial -sided wrist pain when

US Wrist  
While some investigators have tried high-resolution US with or  without arthrography for diagnosing intrinsic 
ligament [41,42], its sensitivity in comparison to MRI, MR arthrography, and CT arthrography is unknown. 
Additionally, imaging with US is largely limited to the dorsal fibers of the ligaments [42]. US may be appropriate 
in cases of suspected de Quervain disease (stenosing tenosynovitis of the abductor pollicis longus and extensor 
pollicis brevis tendon compartment), where preoperative identification of a septum or subcompartmentalization 
within the first dorsal compartment with US may affect surgical management [18,19]. US may be appropriate in 
patients with radial -sided pain in cases where extra-articular pathology is the primary consideration.  
Arthrography  Wrist  
Conventional (x-ray) arthrography has largely been supplanted by CT arthrogra phy and MR arthrography because 
these cross-sectional studies are better able to predict which fibers of the scapholunate ligament are torn and 
whether any repairable fibers remain , both of which are important features that affect operative management . 
Additionally, while fibrocartilage and ligament perforations are moderately associated with ulnar -sided wrist pain, 
there is a poor correlation between ligament lesions and radial -sided pain [45].

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
In patients with chronic wrist pain, imaging studies are  an important adjunct to history, physical examination, 
laboratory testing, and electrophysiology studies. The choice of imaging modality depends on the patient’s 
presentation and the clinical questions being asked. There are scenarios in which no imaging beyond baseline 
radiographs is necessary, but in other situations advanced imaging has added value for diagnostic eva luation and 
treatment planning.  
Overview of Imaging Modalities  
Radiographs  
Imaging evaluation of the painful wrist should begin with radiog raphs [1,2]. This simple study may establish a 
specific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, 
impaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -
anterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or 
more oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling 
[3]. A v ariety of stress positions and maneuvers can be performed to elicit dynamic instability that is not visible 
on standard radiographs [ 4]. Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. 
Additionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ].

Once a scaphoid fracture is identified, Radiographic arthrography does not contribute to the evaluation for 
complications of the fracture.  
Variant 12: Chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or nonspecific. Suspect carpal tunnel syndrome.  Next 
study. 
US Wrist 
Several meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the 
carpal  tunnel  inlet) is highly accurate for identifying carpal  tunnel syndrome  diagnosed clinically or with the 
combination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US 
varies depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the 
measurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary 
examination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel

MRI Wrist  
Both traumatic and degenerative lesions of the TFCC can produce chronic, ulnar -sided wrist pain . MRI is highly 
accurate for lesions involving the radial (central) zone of the disc, especially with the use of high -resolution fast 
spin-echo or 3-D grad ient-recalled pulse sequences [36]. There is some evidence suggesting that MRI performed 
with a 3.0 T system is even more accurate than MRI performed with a 1.5 T system for TFCC lesions [37], but 
there are no studies comparing the accuracy of the two field s trengths in the same patients. The sensitivity for 
tears of the ulnar attachment of the disc and the peripheral attachments (the ulnocarpal ligaments) are only fair 
with noncontrast -enhanced wrist MRI [ 12,36]. IV contrast seldom provides added benefit in patients with ulnar -
sided wrist pain but may increase sensitivity for TFCC lesions if MR arthrography is desired but direct joint 
injection is not feasible.

both the flexor and extensor wrist compartments [46]. Occult ganglion cysts are also easily identified with MRI, 
but some authors recommend use of IV contrast to distinguish ganglia from synovitis [ 47]. For noncystic soft-
tissue masses, MRI may demonstrate findings that are diagnostic for certain benign conditions (eg, lipomas, 
hemangiomas, benign nerve sheath tumors), and can stage the extent of involvement for nonspecific masses ( see 
the ACR Appropriateness Criteria® topic on “ Soft-Tissue Masses ” [48]).

preferred examination for suspected distal radioulnar joint subluxation, where images of both wrists can be  
obtained in both supination and pronation [1 ,13]. A disadvantage of CT  is its lower sensitivity to soft -tissue 
abnormalities  compared with MRI.  
High-resolution (typically multidetector) CT of the wrist following contrast injection into one or more wrist 
compartments (CT arthrography) is a powerful tool for diagnosing intra -articular abnormalities [14,15]. The 
intraobserver agreement on CT arthrogram images is extremely high and better than that reported for MRI 
[14,16]. 
US 
US of the wrist is useful for examining extra -articular soft tissues, such as suspected ganglion cyst s [17], because 
its accuracy is similar to that of MRI. US can also be used to diagnose abnormalities of the flexor and extensor 
tendons and tendon sheaths. For de Quervain disease (stenosing tenosynovitis of the abductor pollicis lon gus and 
extensor pollicis brevis tendon compartment), preoperative identification of a septum or subcompartmentalization 
within the first dorsal compartment with US  may affect surgical management [18 ,19]. 
In patients with suspected or established rheumatoid arthritis (RA), US examination of the wrist and selected 
finger joints can identify erosions and active synovit is (with the use of power Doppler), findings that influence 
early diagnosis and treatment decisions [20]. Using US to measure the size of the median nerve is a  validated

Several meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the

combination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US 
varies depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the 
measurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary 
examination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel 
syndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal 
tunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless,

No literature directly addresses the appropriateness of imaging studies beyond radiographs in patients with

aspiration should not be delayed in order to obtain advanced imaging studies. In cases of suspected septic arthritis, 
percutaneous aspiration of the wrist is indicated, even when radiographs appear normal. Aspirates should be 
analyzed by cell count, gram stain, and appropriate cultures. Microscopic crystal analysis should also be obtained 
if there is a possibility of gout, acute pseudogout, or hydroxyapatite deposition disease. Aspiration can be 
performed without imaging guidance i f the joint is distended, but either fluoroscopy or US  may be useful if a 
specific compartment is to be targeted.

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
In patients with chronic wrist pain, imaging studies are  an important adjunct to history, physical examination, 
laboratory testing, and electrophysiology studies. The choice of imaging modality depends on the patient’s 
presentation and the clinical questions being asked. There are scenarios in which no imaging beyond baseline 
radiographs is necessary, but in other situations advanced imaging has added value for diagnostic eva luation and 
treatment planning.  
Overview of Imaging Modalities  
Radiographs  
Imaging evaluation of the painful wrist should begin with radiog raphs [1,2]. This simple study may establish a 
specific diagnosis in patients with arthritis, complications of injury, infection, some bone or soft -tissue tumors, 
impaction syndromes, or  static wrist instability. The standard radiographic examination consists of posterior -
anterior (PA) and lateral views, ideally performed in neutral position and rotation, often supplemented by one or 
more oblique view [1 ,2]. The lateral view is important for demonstrating malalignments and soft -tissue swelling 
[3]. A v ariety of stress positions and maneuvers can be performed to elicit dynamic instability that is not visible 
on standard radiographs [ 4]. Other nonstandard projections may be indicated for specific suspected problems. 
Additionally, radiogra phs are necessary for accurate measurement of ulnar variance [5 ].

with a 3.0 T system is even more accurate than MRI performed with a 1.5 T system for TFCC lesions [37], but

tears of the ulnar attachment of the disc and the peripheral attachments (the ulnocarpal ligaments) are only fair

Chronic  hip pain is a common chief  complaint  for patients , reportedly affecting  30% to 40% of adults  who play 
sports  [1,2] , and 12% to 15% of all adults  over 60 [3,4] . A wide variety  of pathological  entities  may cause hip pain,

spine,  sacroiliac,  or knee  joints  can also cause hip pain [8], and these  etiologies  should  be investigated  as needed . 
There is limited  original  research  that specifically  targets the imaging  of chronic  hip pain,  but imaging  of specific  
conditions  is widely  discussed  in the published  literature.

in which each procedure provides unique clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 2 : In the setting of chronic hip pain with negative or nondiagnostic radiographs, MRI hip  without IV 
contrast or US hip  is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for suspected noninfectious extra -articular 
abnormality, such as tendonitis or bursitis.  These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure 
will be ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).  
• Variant 3 : In the setting of chronic hip pain with negative or nondiagnostic radiographs, MR arthrography hip 
or MRI hip without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for suspected impingement or

supporting indirect  arthrography is very limited , it is a technique  that is not often  used clinically.  
MRI Hip Without IV Contrast  
MRI is currently  the reference standard  for evaluation  of labral  pathology [85]. For evaluating  labral  tears,  MRI  
with or without  arthrography can be used [76-79]. Several  investigators  suggest  that high-resolution  3T MRI may 
improve  the visualization  of the acetabular  labrum  and the hyaline  articular  cartilage  [69,70] , which  may obviate  
the need  for intra-articular  contrast  [86]. Other  investigators  have  obtained  satisfacto ry results in detecting  labral  
and hyaline  cartilage  lesions with high- resolution  MRI  of the hip at 1.5T without intra-articular  contrast  [58,68] . 
US Hip 
Although not as commonly used as MRI for the detection  of labral  pathology,  US has been  able to document  the 
presence of labral  tears in patients  with hip pain [87,88] . However,  it is not as sensitive as other  modalities  for 
detecting  labral  tears [17]. US can also be used to localize paralabral  cysts for aspiration  and injection  [39,41] . 
Variant  5: Chronic  hip pain. Radiographs  equivocal or positive  for mild osteoarthritis.  Evaluate  articular

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  hip pain is a common chief  complaint  for patients , reportedly affecting  30% to 40% of adults  who play 
sports  [1,2] , and 12% to 15% of all adults  over 60 [3,4] . A wide variety  of pathological  entities  may cause hip pain, 
including  osseous  as well as intra- or extra -articular  soft tissue abnormalities  [5-7]. Pathology  involving  the lumbar  
spine,  sacroiliac,  or knee  joints  can also cause hip pain [8], and these  etiologies  should  be investigated  as needed . 
There is limited  original  research  that specifically  targets the imaging  of chronic  hip pain,  but imaging  of specific  
conditions  is widely  discussed  in the published  literature. 
Before  imaging,  an appropriate  assessment  of a patient’s  clinical  history  and physical  examination  is essential  in 
trying  to pare down the range  of possible etiologies  for a patient’s  symptoms.",True

BMLs [30,31]. Similar to CT, MRI can calculate various anatomic measurements associated with patellofemoral 
subluxation/dislocation and lateral patellofemoral friction syndrome [32-34]. Bone marrow edema in the classic 
location for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also 
differentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise 
therapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. 
Other etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat 
pad impingement syndromes, Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome, adhesive 
capsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes , 
and osteonecrosis [15, 19,36-45].  
MRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a 
joint effusion. However, contrast -enhanced images ma y be more accurate in diagnosing other causes of chronic 
knee pain , such as Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome, and adhesive 
capsulitis [15].  In particular, enh ancing synovitis thicker than 2 mm in Hoffa’s fat is correlated with peripatellar 
pain [46]. Contrast -enhanced MRI is also useful in quantifying the degree of synovitis and in evaluating 
conditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis [ 17,42,47,48].

Special Imaging  Considerations  
Knee radiographs  should include at least one frontal projection of one or both knees (anteroposterior, Rosenberg, 
or tunnel), a tangential patellar view , and a lateral view of the affected knee [2,9]. Standing radiographs more 
accurately reflect medial and lateral compartment cartilage loss than supine radiographs with the posteromedial and posterolateral joint compartments  more accurately assessed using a weight -bearing flexion posteroanterior 
radiograph [9,10].

Bone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the 
subchondral bone.  New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or 
patients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee 
pain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the 
origin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. 
Subchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed 
spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to 
elderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs 
often initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, 
and progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is 
suspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria
® 
topic on “ Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae ” [28]. 
Some patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using 
quantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs 
exhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ].

Summary of Literature Review  
Background/Introduction 
Chronic knee pain affects tens of millions of people  in the United States annually , with the pain sometimes highly

Page Content: Patellofemoral car tilage loss is also associated with chronic knee pain , with active knee pain correlated with 
BMLs [30,31]. Similar to CT, MRI can calculate various anatomic measurements associated with patellofemoral 
subluxation/dislocation and lateral patellofemoral friction syndrome [32-34]. Bone marrow edema in the classic 
location for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also 
differentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise 
therapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. 
Other etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat 
pad impingement syndromes, Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome, adhesive 
capsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes , 
and osteonecrosis [15, 19,36-45].  
MRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a 
joint effusion. However, contrast -enhanced images ma y be more accurate in diagnosing other causes of chronic 
knee pain , such as Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome, and adhesive 
capsulitis [15].  In particular, enh ancing synovitis thicker than 2 mm in Hoffa’s fat is correlated with peripatellar 
pain [46]. Contrast -enhanced MRI is also useful in quantifying the degree of synovitis and in evaluating 
conditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis [ 17,42,47,48].

Bone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the 
subchondral bone.  New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or 
patients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee 
pain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the 
origin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. 
Subchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed 
spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to

often initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, 
and progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is 
suspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  shoulder  pain lasting  >6 months  is a common  presenting  complaint , particularly  in patients  ≥40 years of 
age [1]. Along with a thorough history and physical  examination,  imaging  plays  a critical  role in determining the 
source of chronic  shoul der pain.  Common pain generators in the shoulder  include  the rotator  cuff tendons,  biceps 
tendon,  labrum,  glenohumeral  articular  cartilage,  acromioclavicular  joint, bones,  suprascapular  and axillary  nerves,  
and the joint capsule/synovium.  Imaging  can help to guide  appropriate  therapy , which  can range  from  conservative  
measures such as physical  therapy  and cortico steroid  injections  to more  invasive  procedures  such as arthroscopy or 
surgery . This document  focuses on the imaging approach  to patients  with suspected  chronic  mechanical  shoulder  
pain.

US is reported  to be 98% sensitive and 94% specific for calcium  hydroxyapatite  in the rotator  cuff tendons  [71], 
although  identification  may be challenging if the area of calcium  deposition  is small . At times  US may have  
difficulty  distinguishing calcific  deposits  from  heterotopic  ossification  because both can result  in dense shadowing  
at US. US can be used if there  is concern  for concomitant  rotator  cuff tendon tear and may be a better  modality  than 
MRI in this situation  given the difficulty  of distinguishing  calcium  from  normal  tendon at MRI.  
Variant  4: Chronic  shoulder  pain. Suspect  labral pathology  or shoulder  instability.  Initial radiographs

There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of bone  scan shoulder  in the evaluation  of chronic  shoulder  pain 
when  labral  pathology  or shoulder  instability  is suspected.  
CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
CT arthrograms  have  been  shown  to be an accurate modality  in the assessment  of shoulder  instability  because of  its 
depiction  of osseous,  cartilaginous,  and labroligamentous  injuries  [18,72] . Labral  evaluation  in the postoperative  
setting  may be better  with CT arthrography than MRI  in patients  with metallic  suture  anchors  [73] and has been  
used to evaluate for healing  after superior  labrum  anterior -to-posterior  (SLAP)  repair  [74]. Dual -energy  CT 
arthrography  has a similar  diagnostic  performance  as MR arthrography  [75].

ultrashort  or zero echo  time sequences [96-98], 3-D sequences  [99], or conventional  MRI  sequences  [100]  to 
measure glenoid bone  loss with a high concordance  to CT images.  
Radiography Shoulder  Additional Views  
There are several  options  for additional  radiographic  views in patients  with suspected  instability  [1]. The West  Point  
and Garth  views can demonstrate the anterior  inferior glenoid at a better  advantage  in patients  with a suspected  
Bankart  fracture.  A Stryker  notch  view can sometimes demonstrate  a Hill-Sachs lesion  that is difficult  to see on 
conventional  projections.  Although these additional  projections  are used by some  practitioners , they do not usually  
alleviate  the need  for advanced  imaging.  
US Shoulder  
The posterior  labrum  can be reliably  visualized  with US, with posterior  labral  tears potentially  visualized  
particularly  if the joint is distended  [101] . However,  US is of limited  benefit  in assessing  the anterior

comparable alternative  to MR arthrography in the evaluation  of rotator  cuff tendon tears [16,17] . CT arthrography 
is able to detect  very subtle  articular  surface cuff defects,  but, because of lack of contrast  extension  from  the

Glenohumeral  osteoarthritis  is typically  well visualized  on conventional  radiographic  views,  without  the need  for

glenoid morphology in patients with severe osteoarthritis  [145-147] . A measurement  of the critical shoulder  angle  
can be drawn  on routine  AP radiographs  by measuring  the angle  between  a line along the glenoid  surface and a line 
from  the inferior glenoid to the lateral  acromial  margin;  patients  with a higher  measurement  may be at high risk of 
having a full thickness rotator  cuff tear [148] .

recommending MRI shoulder without IV contrast or WBC shoulder scan or sulfur colloid scan. There is 
insufficient medical literature to conclude whether or not these patients would benefit from these procedures. 
Imaging with these procedures is controversial in this patient population but may be appropriate.  
• Variant 4 : Following radiographs, MRI shoulder without IV contrast or CT shoulder without IV contrast is

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 12 Shoulder Pain –Traumatic  MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography is the preferred exam ination  for the evaluation of subacute shoulder dislocations or recurrent 
shoulder instability. MRI has been shown to have similar performance to CT in the evaluation of Hill-Sachs 
lesions and glenoid bone loss [12,18]. MR arthrography has also been found to be reliable in diagnosi ng anterior 
shoulder instability and labroligamentous injuries [58,59]. MR arthrography has specifically o utperformed 
noncontrast MRI in assessment of glenohumeral ligament and anterior labral injuries [ 17,19], which ar e 
commonly seen in shoulder instability. MR arthrogr aphy has also outperformed noncontrast MRI in diagnosis of 
rotator cuff tears [17,19], which is a common associated finding in older patients with shoulder dislocation. 
However, high sensitivities reported for MR arthrography in the detection of labral pathology may not be 
applicable to patients with clinically unstable shoulders. A retrospective review of 90 patients with clinically 
unstable shoulders selected for arthroscopy [ 60] found that MR arthrography had a sensitivity of 65% for 
detection of labral  tears. The authors proposed that this discrepancy with prior studies was the result of different 
patient selection criteria (clinically unstable in their study versus less-specific symptoms such as shoulder pain in 
others) and the interpretation of MR art hrography by experienced musculoskeletal radiologists [ 60]. For this 
document, it is assumed the procedure is performed and interpreted by an expert.  
MRI Shoulder  
MRI without contrast may be pre ferred to MR arthrography in the setting of acute shoulder dislocation when a 
post-traumatic joint effusion is present to provide sufficient visualization of soft -tissue structures. In the subacute 
or chronic setting, the glenohumeral joint effusion is usually too small to provide adequate joint distention for 
optimal assessment  of soft -tissue structures.

Glenohumeral  osteoarthritis  is typically  well visualized  on conventional  radiographic  views,  without  the need  for 
special  views.  A standard  axillary  view can demonstrate posterior  subluxation of the humeral  head  and abnormal  
glenoid morphology in patients with severe osteoarthritis  [145-147] . A measurement  of the critical shoulder  angle  
can be drawn  on routine  AP radiographs  by measuring  the angle  between  a line along the glenoid  surface and a line 
from  the inferior glenoid to the lateral  acromial  margin;  patients  with a higher  measurement  may be at high risk of 
having a full thickness rotator  cuff tear [148] . 
US Shoulder  
Although secondary  signs  of osteoarthritis  such as osteophytes,  joint effusion , and intra-articular  bodies  can be seen 
with US [142] , it is not typically  performed  for this indication.

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
There has been  a rapid  increase  in the number  of shoulder  arthroplasties,  including  partial  or complete humeral  head  
resurfacing,  hemiarthroplasty,  total shoulder  arthroplasty,  and reverse total shoulder  arthroplasty,  performed  in the 
United  States  over the past 2 decades [1]. The most  recent  published estimates have  reported  a 2.5-fold  increase in 
the number  of shoulder  arthroplasties performed  between  1998 and 2008,  from  19,000 to 47,000 [1,2] . Overall,  
total shoulder  arthroplasties are the most  common  type,  having surpassed  hemiarthroplasties in the last decade [1]. 
Most  shoulder  arthroplasties are performed  for degenerative  conditions.  Humeral  head  resurfacing  is indicated  in 
patients  with humeral  head  osteonecrosis,  large Hill-Sachs deformity,  or focal  osteoarthrosis.

A symptomatic primary shoulder arthroplasty has a wide variety of potential etiologies that includ es loosening, 
infection, periprosthetic fracture, and rotator cuff tear. Periprosthetic  fractures of the glenoid  and humerus  can occur  
intraoperatively  as well as postoperatively.  Complications  related  to surgical  technique,  such as excessive  reaming  
or impaction,  are the most  common  reasons for fractures in the intraoperative  setting,  with a reported  incidence of 
2.1%  [6]. In the postoperative setting, a 1% incidence  of periprosthetic  fractures  has been  reported;  patients’  other  
medical  comorbidities  (assessed  using the Deyo -Charlson  index)  are found to be significant  risk factors [10,19] . 
Humeral  fractures  have  been  found to be more  common than glenoid fractures.  Fractures of the acromion  and spine  
of the scapula are more  common  in the setting  of reverse total shoulder  arthroplasty  and are thought  to be related  to 
an intraoperative  complication  or, more  commonly,  chronic  stress [4]. 
3-Phase  Bone  Scan  with  SPECT  or SPECT/CT Shoulder  
There is no relevant literature to support the use of a 3 -phase bone scan with SPECT or SPECT/CT as a first-line 
imaging modality in the acutely symptomatic patient with a primary shoulder arthroplasty.  Similar  to bone  scans,  a 
3-phase bone  scan is highly sensitive for the detection  of periprosthetic  fractures  but suffers  from  low specificity.

The presence  of glenohumeral  osteoarthritis  on initial radiographs  does not typically  require  additional  imaging  
unless additional pathology  is suspected,  such as a rotator  cuff tear or surgery  is a consideration . 
Bone  Scan  Shoulder  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of bone  scan shoulder  in the evaluation  of chronic  shoulder  pain 
when  initial radiographs  demonstrate  osteoarthritis.  
CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
CT arthrography  can be helpful  in the preoperative  planning  of total shoulder  arthroplasty  in patients  with severe 
glenohumeral  arthritis. CT arthrography  provides  excellent  imaging  of osseous detail allowing  for characterization  
of glenoid morphology,  version,  and bone  loss. Unlike  nonarthrogram  CT, CT arthrography  allows for adequate  
characterization  of a rotator  cuff tear [16,17] , which  may alter the chosen  arthroplasty  type. Arthrogram  contrast  
also outlines  the articular  cartilage surface,  demonstrating areas of cartilage  loss, which  cannot  be directly  visualized  
with conventional  CT. 
CT Shoulder  With  IV Contrast  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of CT shoulder  with IV contrast  in the evaluation  of chronic  
shoulder  pain when  initial radiographs  demonstrate  osteoarthritis.  
CT Shoulder  Without  and With  IV Contrast  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of CT shoulder  without  and with IV contrast  in the evaluation  of

Page Content: Radiography Shoulder  
Radiography  is the first and main  imaging  modality  utilized  in the evaluation  of both the symptomatic  and 
asymptomatic shoulder  arthroplasty  [10,13] . Findings on radiographs can be used to diagnose and guide further 
assessment of both osseous and high-grade rotator cuff abnormalities. Radiographs  are particularly  helpful  for the 
detection  of scapular  fractures  that can occur  with relatively  minor  trauma  in patients  with reverse shoulder  
prostheses [24]. 
US Shoulder  
US examinations  are not typically  ordered  as a first -line study for  evaluation  of pain in the setting  of shoulder  
arthroplasty.  Nevertheless,  US provides assessment of the rotator cuff integrity and is  capable of detecting  cortical  
discontinuity and step-off in the setting  of a fracture  after shoulder  arthroplasty  [25]. 
Variant  3: Symptomatic  patient  with  a primary  shoulder  arthroplasty,  infection not excluded. Additional 
imaging following radiographs.  
Infection,  including osteomyelitis  and septic arthritis, after total shoulder  arthroplasty  is an uncommon albeit  
potentially  devastating  complication, with a prevalence of 0.7%  to 2.9% . Infection  is more  common  in males and a 
younger  age group  [3,26,27] . A 97% infection -free  rate at 20 years has been  reported  [28]. Predisposing  underlying 
conditions  may include  rheumatoid  arthritis, corticosteroid  use, diabetes,  repeated  intra-articular  steroid  injections,  
and prior  shoulder  surgery  [26]. 
Infection  rates are higher  in the setting  of reverse total shoulder  arthroplasties,  with a range  of 0.8%  to 10% [29].

Glenohumeral  osteoarthritis  is typically  well visualized  on conventional  radiographic  views,  without  the need  for 
special  views.  A standard  axillary  view can demonstrate posterior  subluxation of the humeral  head  and abnormal  
glenoid morphology in patients with severe osteoarthritis  [145-147] . A measurement  of the critical shoulder  angle  
can be drawn  on routine  AP radiographs  by measuring  the angle  between  a line along the glenoid  surface and a line 
from  the inferior glenoid to the lateral  acromial  margin;  patients  with a higher  measurement  may be at high risk of 
having a full thickness rotator  cuff tear [148] .

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  hip pain is a common chief  complaint  for patients , reportedly affecting  30% to 40% of adults  who play 
sports  [1,2] , and 12% to 15% of all adults  over 60 [3,4] . A wide variety  of pathological  entities  may cause hip pain, 
including  osseous  as well as intra- or extra -articular  soft tissue abnormalities  [5-7]. Pathology  involving  the lumbar  
spine,  sacroiliac,  or knee  joints  can also cause hip pain [8], and these  etiologies  should  be investigated  as needed . 
There is limited  original  research  that specifically  targets the imaging  of chronic  hip pain,  but imaging  of specific  
conditions  is widely  discussed  in the published  literature. 
Before  imaging,  an appropriate  assessment  of a patient’s  clinical  history  and physical  examination  is essential  in 
trying  to pare down the range  of possible etiologies  for a patient’s  symptoms.

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
It has been  approximately  60 years since Sir John Charnl ey introduced the modern era of hip replacement  surgery  
[1]. Approximately  370,000 primary  total hip arthroplasties (THAs)  were performed  in the United  States in 2014  
[2]. Sloan  et al [2] estimated  that the volume of primary  THAs  would  increase to 635,000 procedure s annually by 
2030.  
Over  the years,  modifications  have  been  made  to attempt  to decrease  complications  such as loosening and wear  
with additional  fixation  techniques  (eg, osseointegration ) and articular  surfaces  (eg, metal  on highly  cross -linked  
polyethylene , antioxidant  doped polyethylene  liners,  metal -on-metal  [MoM], ceramic on polyethylene , and ceramic  
on ceramic articulations)  [3-5]. 
Second -generation  MoM prostheses were introduced in the late 1990s  [6]. These  prostheses were preferentially  
used for younger  patients  with osteoarthritis  [7].

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 12 Imaging After Total Hip Arthroplasty  demonstrated  that for lesions of all sizes,  CT was less sensitive than MRI (CT, 74.7%  sensitive and MRI,  95.4%  
sensitive) [126] . 
Most CT examinations of prostheses are not routinely performed with  either IV or intraarticular contrast, 
particularly now that MAR algorithms for CT have been introduced [22,23] . 
Fluoride  PET/CT Skull Base To Mid-Thigh 
Although most  investigations  have  focused  on the ability  of fluoride  PET/CT to differentiate  between  aseptic  
loosening and periprosthetic  infection, normal  asymptomatic controls  were included in several  of them.  Kobayashi  
et al [98] reported  that increased  periprosthetic  uptake  was present  in all cases of loose ning and infection  but in only 
1 (3.7%)  of 27 controls.  Kumar  et al [99] reported  that 10 of 12 (83.3%)  asymptomatic hip prostheses demonstrated  
no periprosthetic  uptake,  whereas periprosthetic  uptake  was present  around  all 28 aseptically  loosened  and all 16 
infected  devices.  Choe  at al [97] reported  that 3 of 17 (17.6%)  control  hip prostheses demonstrated  minor  
periprosthetic  uptake  and the mean  SUV max (4) was significantly  less than that of aseptic loosening (7) and infection  
(11); P < .01 and P < .001,  respectively.  
Image -Guided Anesthetic Injection  of Hip  
Intraarticular  anesthetic has been  used to evaluate painful  THAs,  primarily  to differentiate  referred  pain (especially  
from  the spine)  from  pain originating  in the hip [127] . Significant pain relief  after intraarticular  anesthetic injection  
suggests an intraarticular  cause [128,129] .

There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of fluoride  PET/CT skull  base to mid-thigh  in the evaluation  of the 
symptomatic  hip prosthesis in the setting  of acute injury . 
Image -Guided Aspiration  Hip 
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of image -guided aspiration  of the hip in the evaluation  of the 
symptomatic  hip prosthesis in the setting  of acute injury . 
MRI Hip 
MRI can demonstrate femoral  periprosthetic  fractures  and stress reactions [18]. However,  a nondis placed  fracture  
may be difficult to see on MRI if there is only mild associated  marrow edema,  and susceptibility  artifact  from  the 
prosthesis may obscure  the pertinent  findings  [72]. Pelvic  fractures  can be demonstrated.  There is no relevant 
literature documenting t he additional benefit of MRI with IV contrast, relative to noncontrast MRI, for fracture 
detection.  
US Hip 
US is limited  in its ability  to detect  periprosthetic  fracture  [73]. 
WBC  Scan  and Sulfur  Colloid Scan  Hip 
There is insufficient  evidence to support  the use of white  blood cell (WBC) and sulfur  colloid  of the hip imaging  in 
the evaluation  of the symptomatic  hip prosthesis in the setting  of acute injury . 
Variant  4: Symptomatic  hip arthroplasty  patient, infection not excluded. Additional imaging  following  
radiographs.  
Ong et al [74] found the incidence of infection  after THA  in the Medicare population for 1997 and 2006 to be 1.63%  
within  2 years and 0.59%  between  2 and 10 years.  The identification  of periprosthetic  infection  is critical  to choosing  
appropriate  treatment  but diagnosis  can be challenging  [75].

Based  on the available data,  fluoride  PET/CT does not appear  to offer any advantages over FDG-P ET/CT or 3-
phase bone  scintigraphy  for diagnosing periprosthetic  hip infection  [97-100] . 
Image -Guided Aspiration  Hip 
Although both false-positive  and false- negative  results may occur,  joint aspiration  with synovial  fluid  analysis  
remains probably the most  useful  test for confirming  the presence or absence of infection  and identifying the 
causative organism  [101] . A meta-analysis by Carli  et al [102]  yielded  a mean  sensiti vity of 68.6%  and a specificity  
of 96.4%  for joint aspiration  culture.  Hip aspiration  can be performed  using fluoroscopic,  US, or CT guidance  or 
without  image  guidance  [103-105] . Contrast injection has been described for  CT arthrography following joint 
aspiration  [106] . 
Specific  tests of retrieved  synovial  fluid  such as alpha-defensi n and polymerase  chain  reaction  for bacteria and 
leukocyte  esterase are beyond the scope of this review  [107] . 
MRI Hip 
MRI can demonstrate  soft tissue and bone  features associated  with periprosthetic  infection , including inflammatory  
synovitis  that may have  a lamellated  appearance [108] , soft tissue edema,  lymphadenopathy,  fluid  collections , bone  
marrow  edema,  and periosteal  reaction  [72,109-112] . 
IV contrast  can be used to differentiate  phlegmon from  abscess and to define  sinus  tracts and communicating fluid  
collections  [72]. However,  IV contrast  is generally  not necessary  to make  the diagnosis  of infection  [72].

Page Content: Guidelines  for patient evaluation  have  been  developed  
[76]. A definition  of periprosthetic  infection  has been  proposed by the musculoskeletal  infection  society  that 
includes  major  and minor  criteria  but not specifically  imaging criteria  [75]. 
Bone  Scan  and Gallium  Scan  Hip 
The most  recent  data on bone  and gallium  scans for diagnosing periprosthetic  hip infection  are more  than 25 years  
old because this test has been  largely  replaced  by labeled  leukocyte  and marrow  imaging  and FDG -PET [77-79]. 
Bone  Scan and Gallium  Scan  with SPECT  or SPECT/CT Hip 
There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of bone  and gallium  scan with SPECT or SPECT/CT of the hip as 
these tests have  been  replaced  by leukocyte  and bone  marrow  imaging  and FDG-PET for diagnosing  periprosthetic  
hip infection.  
Bone  Scan  Hip 
Bone  scan of the hip is sensitive but not specific for periprosthetic  hip infection.  Performing  the test as a 3-phase  
bone  scan does not improve  accuracy,  with reported  sensitivity  and specificity  ranging  from  29% to 88% and 50% 
to 92%,  respectively  [61,80 -82]. 
Bone  Scan  with  SPECT  or SPECT/CT  Hip 
Schweizer  et al [83] retrospectively  studied  58 total hip prostheses,  including  31 symptomati c and 27 asymptomatic  
prostheses,  with bone  scan with SPECT/CT. SPECT/CT identified  the cause of pain in 19 (61%)  of the 31 
symptomatic  devices.  No pathology-specific uptake  pattern  was observed.

WBC  Scan  and Sulfur  Colloid Scan  Hip 
The role of combined leukocyte  and marrow  imaging  for diagnosing periprosthetic  hip infection  has been  studied  
by several  investigators.  Specificity  has consistently  been  high,  ranging from  88% to 100%.  Sensitivity  has been

This variant  includes  wear,  loosening,  and osteolysi s. 
Bone  Scan  Hip

diagnose  aseptic loosening  in the acetabular  and femoral  components , with sensitivities  and specificities ranging

[80] reviewed  the results of 3-phase bone  scans performed  on 100 patients  with a painful  hip prosthesis.  They 
reported that an abnormal scan could not differentiate aseptic loosening from infection. Although a normal result 
excluded aseptic loosening and infection, the ability of the bone scan to identify or exclude other conditions such as wear, osteolysis, and soft tissue abnormalities as the cause of the patient’s symptoms was not addressed.

Radiographic  Arthrography  Hip 
Weakness or detachment  of the abductor  muscles may occur  after THA using  an anterolateral  approach  [148] . 
Avulsion of the reattached  gluteus  medius  can provide  a communication between  the hip joint and the trochanteric 
bursa  that can be documented on arthrography [148] . Ylinen  et al [148]  found that all 14 patients  with this 
communication had abductor  avulsion  at revision  surgery.  A negative  study  did not exclude disruption  (sensitivity  
60.1%,  specificity  100%).  The failure  of contrast  to extend to the trochanteric region in these cases was attributed  
to blocking of its flow by a fibrous  capsule.

Page Content: Severe instability  can result  in 
dislocation. In a 2014 review of 781 cases of prosthesis failure,  Sharkey  et al [12] found that instability  represented  
the third  most  common  cause of prosthesis failure  overall,  accounting  for 7.5%  of all cases.  The concepts of 
instability, malalignment, and loosening in TKA are closely  interrelated  [117] . When  malalignme nt of the joint is 
created  at the time of surgery,  minor  degrees of instability  can become a significant  problem.  By the same  token,  
instability, ongoing over time, can give rise to malalignment, which,  in turn, can lead to loosening.  Although 
ligamentous  balance/imbalance plays  a role in joint instability, it is not the only factor  accounting for stability  [118] . 
3-Phase  Bone  Scan  Knee  
There is insufficient  evidence to support  routine  use of Tc-99m  3-phase bone  scans for the assessment  of instability.  
Bone  scintigraphy may be helpful  in diagnosing loosening,  especially  when  obtained many  years after surgery  [62]. 
This delay  in maximum utility  is because of  the observation that positive  bone  scans are noted in 20% of 
asymptomatic knees 1 year after surge ry and in 12.5%  of individuals  2 years after surgery [61] . Serial  bone  scans 
may be more  helpful  than a single  examination  [119] . Generally,  increased  uptake  on the delayed  images  but not 
on the blood- pool phase is thought  to be due to loosening rather  than to infection  [60]. Normal  scans are most  
helpful  and are characterized  by a high NPV,  indicating  that loosening or infection  is unlikely.

Radionuclide  3-phase bone  scans can demonstrate  increased  activity  at a site of periprosthetic  fracture  and can show

include  postoperative  change;  however,  with serial  imaging,  this postoperative activity  should decrease over time,  
whereas activity  increasing  over time would be suggestive of a prosthetic  complication, such as a periprosthetic  
fracture,  aseptic loosening,  or infection. Therefore,  no conclusion should  be drawn  on an isolated  bone  scan unless

patients  report  ongoing pain or are not satisfied  with the result  [9]. Factors,  which  contribute  to patient  
dissatisfaction , include  unmet  expectations,  functional  limitations,  and postoperative  complications  including pain 
[10]. Most  TKA  patients  expe rience improved outcomes  and long implant survival,  with long-term  TKA failure  
rates of <1% per year [5]. The growth in the number  of primary  TKA  procedures  has been  accompanied  by increased  
rates of TKA revision  procedures  [1]. Revision  procedures  for TKAs have  increased  by 5.4 procedures  per 100,000  
persons  per decade over the period from  1990  to 2002,  with a mean  revision  burden of 8.2%  [11]. Nearly  1.5 million  
of those  with primary  knee  replacement  are 50 to 69 years  of age, underscoring a large population at risk for revision  
surgery  and long-term  complications  [5]. Sharkey  et al [12] reviewed  781 revision  TKAs and found  the most  
common  failure  mechanisms  were  loosening (39.9%),  infection  (27.4%),  instability  (7.5%),  periprosthetic  fracture  
(4.7%),  and arthrofibrosis  (4.5%) . Infection  was the most  common  reason  for early  revision  (<2 years after the 
initial TKA) , and aseptic loosening was the most  common  reason  for late revision.  Compared  with a review  
performed  by the same  author  in 2002 [13], polyethylene  wear  is no longer  the major  cause  of failure , and the 
percentages of revisions  for polyethylene  wear,  instability, arthrofibrosis,  malalignment,  and extensor  mechanism  
deficiency  have  all decreased.

Special Imaging  Considerations   
In some  patients with knee  arthroplasties,  repeated  hemarthroses are caused  by synovial  hyperemia  or true 
arteriovenous  malformations.  These patients can be successfully  diagnosed with angiography and treated  with 
embolization. In rare instances,  geniculate and popliteal vessel  injuries  may occur  during surgery  [15].

diagnostic  accuracy  (97%)  in the evaluation  of loosening of both hip and knee  arthroplasties in patients with

means of identifying  aseptic prosthetic  joint loosening .

a specificity  of 81% to 86% for the diagnosis  of prosthetic  knee  infection  when  a cutoff  of ≥13.5 mg/L  is used [44]. 
Although CRP  can be elevated  after surgery,  under  normal  circumstances  it generally  returns  to baseline within  2 
months  [44]. A large multicenter  study found CRP  and joint aspiration  to be the most  useful  tools  to diagnose  
infection  [50]. In an attempt  to construct  an algorithm  for evaluating  TKA infection,  Savarino  et al [51] found that 
abnormal  results  for at least 2 of 3 tests (CRP  [cutoff  0.93 mg/L],  ESR [cutoff 27 mm/h],  and fibrinogen  [cutoff  
432 mg/dL])  led to accurate results for the diagnosis  of infection  (sensitivity, 93%;  specificity,  100%;  accuracy,  
97%) . More  recently,  interle ukin-6  has also shown  promise  for diagnosing  infection , with higher  predictive  values 
than most  other  serologic  markers [52], and has shown  excellent  sensitivity  for detecting  infection  after TKA when

Page Content: Staphylococcus  aureus  and coagulase-negative  Staphylococcus  species,  including  Staphylococcus  epidermidis,  are 
the most  common organisms  associated  with these infections  [46]. Both  clinical  findings  and laboratory tests may 
serve useful  in addition  to imaging  studies.  Low-grade  or chronic  TKA  infections  may be difficult to diagnose  
preoperatively.  Duff  et al [18] noted that diagnosis  of infection  was not obvious  in 53% of knees before  revision  
arthroplasty.  Pain is the most  common  presenting  symptom  of infection, but pain is a nonspecific finding [47]. In 
acute infection,  findings  such as pain,  swelling,  warmth,  erythema,  and fever  are common,  whereas chronic  
infections  may be manifested  by pain alone  [44]. Night  pain or pain at rest is characteristic of infection, whereas  
pain on weightbearing  is more  characteristic of mechanical  loosening.  Some  authors  suggest  that infection  needs to 
be excluded  in all patients  with pain persisting  >6 months  after joint replacement  [18]. 
Laboratory findings  in the setting  of TKA infection  are often  nonspecific.  Peripheral  leukocyte  counts  are not 
elevated  in most  patients  with infected  prostheses.  Erythrocyte  sedimentation  rates (ESRs) are abnormal  in patients

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 15 Imaging  After  Total  Knee  Arthroplasty  on fracture  classification,  which  often  includes  information  regarding fracture  location, degree of comminution,  and 
positio n and stability  of the prosthesis.  
3-Phase  Bone  Scan  Knee  
Radionuclide  3-phase bone  scans can demonstrate  increased  activity  at a site of periprosthetic  fracture  and can show  
fractures that are radiographically occult  [137, 138]. In older  osteopen ic individuals  with low rates  of bone  
remodeling,  it may take 48 to 72 hours  for the development  of increased  radionuclide  activity  at the site of fracture.  
Within  1 to 2 years after prosthesis surgery,  the differential  diagnosis  for increased  periprosthetic  activity  would  
include  postoperative  change;  however,  with serial  imaging,  this postoperative activity  should decrease over time,  
whereas activity  increasing  over time would be suggestive of a prosthetic  complication, such as a periprosthetic  
fracture,  aseptic loosening,  or infection. Therefore,  no conclusion should  be drawn  on an isolated  bone  scan unless 
it yields  a normal  study.  
CT Arthrography  Knee  
There is no benefit  to intraarticular  contrast.  
CT Knee  With  IV Contrast  
IV contrast  is not helpful  for CT assessment  of periprosthetic  fracture.  
CT Knee  Without and With  IV Contrast  
IV contrast  is not helpful  for CT assessment  of periprosthetic  fracture.  
CT Knee  Without IV Contrast  
Radiographically occult  fractures may be detected  on CT when  metal  artifact  reduction  techniques  are used [20].

Page Content: FDG -PET/CT  Whole  Body  
A meta -analysis  of FDG -PET/CT  for the staging  of patients  with osteosarcoma  demonstrated  an overall  sensitivity  
of 93% and a specificity  of 97% for detection  of bone  metastases  [6]. Coverage  of a whole  body  FDG -PET/CT  
varies  and usually  extends  either  from  skull  base to thighs  or skull  vertex  to feet. A study  of FDG -PET/CT  in 
patients  with sarcoma  and melanoma  showed  inclusion  of the entire  lower  extremities  does not add additional  
benefit  in identifying  metastases  [31]. 
FDG -PET/CT  is considered  superior  to Tc-99m bone  scan in the detection  of osseous  metastases.  Literature  has 
concluded  this in both general  oncologic  and bone  sarcoma  populations  [30]. FDG -PET/C T is also superior  to CT 
imaging  in this regard.  Quartuccio  et al [22] studied  64 pediatric  patients  with bone  sarcoma  and found  greater  
accuracy  of FDG -PET/CT  (85%  accuracy)  versus  CT (44% accuracy)  in detecting  bone  metastases  during  initial  
staging  of patients  with Ewing  sarcoma.  There  are mixed  conclusions  when  comparing  FDG -PET/CT  versus  MRI  
whole  body  in detecting  osseous  metastases  in general  oncology  populations  [32-34]. In a small  study  of 20 patients  
with Ewing  sarcoma  comparing  FDG -PET/CT  with MRI  whole  body , a single  patient  had a false -positive  bone  
finding  on FDG -PET/CT.

Page Content: Local  recurrence  rates  of bone  sarcomas  are reported  to be approximately  10% to 15% 
in patients  with osteosarcoma  and Ewing  sarcoma  [58-61]. Prognosis  is poor for locally  recurrent  malignant  or 
aggressive  bone  tumors,  with postrecurrence  5-year survival  rates  reported  approximately  15% to 30% in patients  
with osteosarcoma  and 5% in patients  with Ewing  sarcoma  [60,62] . Factors  associated  with poorer  prognosis  in 
patients  with osteosarcoma  were  size of local  recurrence  (>5 cm) and presence  of distant  metastasis  [60]. 
Recommendations  for local  recurrence  surveillance  imaging  vary amongst  expert  guidelines,  although  all 
acknowledge  the benefit  of clinical  evaluation.  Locally  recurrent  bone  tumors  can often  present  as a soft tissue  
mass,  and in a study  of osteosarcoma  local  recurrences,  the majority  (approximately  75%)  were  soft tissue  masses  
rather  than bone  lesions  [60]. Some  guidelines  recommend  clinical  exam ination  to be performed  solely , whereas  
others  recommend  in combination  with imaging  [49,51,52,63] . Time  to recurrence  also varies  with tumor  histology.  
Most  osteosarcoma  local  recurrences  have  been  shown  to occur  within  5 years  of resection.  However,  late 
recurrence  of both osteosarcoma  and Ewing  sarcoma  have  been  reported  [60,61] . In a study  of locally  recurrent  
osteosarcoma,  survival  rates  decreased  from  30% at 5 years  to 13% at 10 years,  suggesting  long-term follow -up

months  in patients  presenting  with acute LBP compared  with their asymptomatic counterparts , except  in disc 
herniation,  nerve  root compression,  and annular  fissure [15]. Even  in the setting  of disc herniation,  imaging  may 
have  limited  role in management  as the majority  of disc herniations  show  some  degree of reabsorption  or regression  
by 8 weeks after symptom onset  [16]. It is important  to note that repeat  imaging  in patients  with new episodes of 
LBP and previous  MRI scans are unlikely  to detect  differences in disc protrusion,  annular  fissures,  high-intensity  
zones,  or end-plate  signal  changes [13]. 
Despite the lack of evidence to support  imaging early  or prior  to conservative treatment  for LBP, there is significant  
variation  in the ordering practices of physicians,  with nonadherance  to guidelines  leading  to increased  health  care 
utilization  [17,18] . A retrospective cohort  study of 145,320  patients ≥66 years of age  with acute nonspecific  LBP,

showed  that 336 (19.0%)  received  lumbar  MRI within  6 weeks of presentation  (nonadherent  to guidelines).  This 
nonadherent  group had an increased  likelihood  of lumbosacral  injections  or surgery  for outpatient, inpatient, and 
nonmedical  services,  and disability  compensation  [17]. Increased  health  care utilization  with early  imaging  has also 
been  demonstrated  in nonworker  populations  [6].

MRI.  The visualization  of the convex  posterior  vertebral  body  border,  extension  into the posterior  elements,  and 
abnormal  marrow  signal  are suggestive  of pathologic  fracture  [58]. 
Radiography Lumbar  Spine  
In patients  with history  of osteoporosis  or steroid  use, initial evaluation  with radiography  is useful  [55]. Radiography  
with anteroposterior  and lateral  radiographs  is useful  for assessing  LBP in patients  with low suspicion  of trauma  or 
minor  trauma  and patients  suspected  of having possible vertebral  compression  fracture.  Upright  radiographs  provide  
useful  functional  information  about  axial  loading.  Flexion  and extension  views can be performed  to evaluate for 
spine  stability. Evaluation  of the extent  of vertebral  body  comminution  is limited  on radiography,  particularly  in 
patients with osteoporosis.

A systematic review examining studies that used red flags  as an indication  for screening  found  that of all the red 
flags,  only a history  of cancer  has been  shown  to increase  the probability  of finding spinal  malignancy  [61]. In a 
patient  suspected  of having cancer,  MRI without  and with IV contrast  is considered  superior  in evaluation  of 
localizing  disease (intramedullary, intradural -extramedullary,  and extradural)  as well as assessing  extent  of the

bone mass decreases slowly over time, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age, and differs by sex, race, 
ethnicity  [10], and comorbidities. In line with the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations for patients  
ages 65 and older being screened for osteoporosis, patients  >65 years of age may be considered at risk for 
osteoporotic fracture when presenting with LBP . 
Additionally,  for those  patients without  neurologic  compromise  and who present  with minor  risk factors for cancer,  
inflammatory  back  disease  (eg, ankylosing spondylitis), vertebral  compression  fracture,  or symptomatic  spinal  
stenosis,  imaging  should be considered  after a trial of therapy  [4]. 
In the majority  of patients, no specific pathology for LBP can be identified. Also,  studies have  shown  imaging  
abnormalities  in a substantial  number  of people  without back  pain [11-13]. The challenge for the clinician, therefore,  
is to distin guish the small  segment  within  this large patient  population that should be evaluated  further because of 
suspicion  of a more  serious  problem  or identify  pathology that requires intervention . 
Other  nonspine  causes of LBP can have overlap  in clinical  presentation,  including inflammatory  arthritis  and other

accurately reflect medial and lateral compartment cartilage loss than supine radiographs with the posteromedial and posterolateral joint compartments  more accurately assessed using a weight -bearing flexion posteroanterior 
radiograph [9,10].

Summary of Literature Review  
Background/Introduction 
Chronic knee pain affects tens of millions of people  in the United States annually , with the pain sometimes highly 
disabling and often negatively impacting the patient’s quality of life. Chronic knee pain has numerous causes, and 
it can present with localized or diffuse symptoms.  Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic knee pain 
with the knee the most common lower extremity joint impacted by osteoarthritis [1 ]. 
Typically, radiography is the initial imaging s tudy used to evaluate chronic pain in a native knee. When pain 
persists but the initial radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, MRI is usually considered the next  
imaging study. However, the use of MRI may be premature and unnecessary in so me patients,  as it is estimated 
that approximately 20% of patients with chronic knee pain have had an MRI performed without recent (within the 
prior year) radiographs [2 ]. 
This document  discusses 5 variants for imaging chronic pain in a native knee in patients  ≥5 years of age.

Page Content: MR Arthrography  Knee  
MR arthrography is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with s igns of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  
US Knee  
US is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  
Bone Scan Knee  
Radionuclide bone scan is usually not indicated to evaluate patients with signs of prior  (chronic) osseous knee 
injury.  
Image -Guided Aspiration Knee  
Joint aspiration is usually not indicated  to evaluate patients with signs of prior (chronic) osseous knee injury.  
Summary of Recommendations  
• Variant 1:  Radiographs  of the knee  are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of  chronic knee pain in 
patients greater than or equal to 5 years of age.  
• Variant 2:  MRI knee without  IV contrast is usually appropriate in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of 
age with chronic knee pain when initial knee  radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion.  
• Variant 3:  MRI knee without  IV contrast is usually appropriate  in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of 
age with chronic knee pain when initial knee radiographs demonstrate OCD,  loose bodies, or history of 
cartilage or meniscal repair.  
• Variant 4:  (1) MRI knee without IV contrast  or (2)  knee aspiration or (3)  CT knee without  IV contrast may 
be appropriate  in patients greater than or equal to 5 years of age with chronic knee pain when initial 
radiographs de monstrate degenerative changes or chondrocalcinosis. While MRI knee without  IV contrast 
may be appropriate more often, knee aspiration and CT knee without IV contrast may be appropriate in 
specific instances detailed in the narrative. On occasion, these ex aminations  may complement each other  with 
more than one being appropriate .

painful or asymptomatic knee not significantly different in patients 45 to 55 years of age [20,21]. 
Bone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the 
subchondral bone.  New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or 
patients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee 
pain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the 
origin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26]. 
Subchondral insufficiency fractures, now recognized as the underlying cause of what was previously termed 
spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee,  most commonly i nvolve the medial femoral condyle in middle -aged to 
elderly females. MRI can identify subchondral insufficiency fractures earlier than radiographs with radiographs 
often initially normal [27]. Radiographs may later reveal articular surface fragmentation, subchondral collapse, 
and progressive osteoarthritis sometimes requiring total knee arthroplasty [27]. Even when a subchondral insufficiency fracture is diagnosed on a conventional radiograph, MRI may be indicated if an additional injury is 
suspected clinically.  MRI can also detect tibial stress fractures as discussed in the AC R Appropriateness Criteria
® 
topic on “ Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture, Including Sacrum, Excluding Other Vertebrae ” [28]. 
Some patients with normal knee radiographs and anterior knee pain have abnormal cartilage on 3 T MRI using 
quantitative imaging [29].  In particular, patients 45 to 55 years of age with knee pain but normal radiographs 
exhibited elevated T2 mapping values on 3 T MRI [20 ].

Page Content: Patellofemoral car tilage loss is also associated with chronic knee pain , with active knee pain correlated with 
BMLs [30,31]. Similar to CT, MRI can calculate various anatomic measurements associated with patellofemoral 
subluxation/dislocation and lateral patellofemoral friction syndrome [32-34]. Bone marrow edema in the classic 
location for patellofemoral dislocation/relocation injuries is also identified by MRI [ 15]. MRI may also 
differentiate  patients with more severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis who may not benefit from supervised exercise 
therapy from patients with medial or lateral knee compartment arthritis who might benefit [35 ]. 
Other etiologies of chronic anterolateral knee pain diagnosed on MRI include patellar tendinopathy, various fat 
pad impingement syndromes, Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, iliotibial band syndrome, adhesive 
capsulitis, medial plicae, discoid meniscus, tumors, ganglion cysts, pigmented villonodular synovitis, osteophytes , 
and osteonecrosis [15, 19,36-45].  
MRI without and with IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or demonstrates a 
joint effusion. However, contrast -enhanced images ma y be more accurate in diagnosing other causes of chronic 
knee pain , such as Hoffa’s disease, deep infrapatellar bursitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome, and adhesive 
capsulitis [15].  In particular, enh ancing synovitis thicker than 2 mm in Hoffa’s fat is correlated with peripatellar 
pain [46]. Contrast -enhanced MRI is also useful in quantifying the degree of synovitis and in evaluating 
conditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis [ 17,42,47,48].

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 8 Shoulder Pain –Traumatic  Variant 2: Traumatic shoulder pain. Nonlocalized shoulder pain. Negative radiographs . Next imaging 
study. 
Appropriately positioned  radiographs can exclude shoulder dislocation and most displaced fractures as the 
etiology for post -traumatic shoulder pain. In the setting of normal shoulder radiographs, the most common causes 
of post -traumatic shoulder pain are soft -tissue injuries such  as rotator cuff and labral tears.  
MRI Shoulder  
Noncontrast MRI is a reasonable imaging study in the setting of acute nonlocalized traumatic shoulder pain and 
noncontributory radiographs. In the acute trauma setting, noncontrast MRI may be preferred to MR arthrography , 
as acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint effusion for assessment of intra -articular 
soft-tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic 
pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [34,35]. MRI is also sensitive for diagnosing bone marrow 
contusion and has  been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries in pediatric patients [ 36,37]. 
MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography has been found to be superior to noncontrast MRI in the diagnosis of labroligamentous and 
partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [17,19]. In the acute trauma setting, however, noncontrast MRI may be 
preferred to MR arthrography because acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint 
effusion for assessment of intra-arti cular soft -tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing 
extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic pathology such as capsular and ligament tears [ 34,35]. MRI is also sensitive 
for diagnosing bone marrow contusion and has been shown to be beneficial in assessing shoulder physeal injuries 
in pediatric patients [ 36,37].

Shoulder dislocation or instability is most co mmon in the anterior direction. Younger patients are more likely to

patients are more likely to have rotator cuff tears in association with shoulder dislocation [ 55]. Coexisting 
humeral avulsion of the glenohumeral ligament and significant glenoid bone loss have been found in up to 10% of 
patients with recurrent shoulder instability [ 56], which underscores the need to assess both osseous and 
labroligamentous pathology in patients with shoulder dislocation or instability. Glenoid morphology and bone 
loss can play a significant factor in recurrent shoulder dislocations [15, 16,57], which may require bone grafting in

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Traumatic shoulder pain is shoulder pain believed to be directly attributed to a traumatic event, either acute or 
chronic. This pain may be the result of either fracture (the clavicle, scapula, or proximal humerus) or soft -tissue 
injury (most commonly of the rotator cuff, acromioclavicular ligaments, or labroligamentous complex). The 
incidence of traumatic shoulder injuries is difficult to determine because some injury types, such as low-grade 
acromioclavicular separations or acute rotator cuff tears, are likely under -reported because patients  do not seek 
immediate medical treatment. However, as with many traumatic injuries, traumatic shoulder pain tends to 
disproportionately involve young adults and male patients [ 1,2]. 
The etiology of traumatic shoulder pain can often be made based on clinical examination, radiographs, and 
mechanism of injury. Traumatic shoulder injuries can generally be separated into in juries requiring acute surgical 
management and injuries in which conservative management can be attempted prior to considering surgical 
treatment. Unstable or significantly displaced fractures and joint instability are injuries most likely requiring acute 
surgical treatment.",False

There is no defined role for US  in evaluation of proximal humeral  fractures. Although fractures may sometimes 
be visible on US as areas of cortical interruption, US  is unable to reliably characterize fracture patterns. In ideal 
conditions, US is effective at identifying full-thickness rotator cuff tears that may be associated with humeral head 
fractures [17,22,44]. However, in the acute setting of humeral head fractur e, an US examination of the shoulder is 
significantly limited by decreased patient mobility and swelling. 
FDG -PET/CT  Skull Base to Mid-Thigh 
FDG-PET in combination with CT  has been shown to be reliable in differentiating benign from malignant 
pathologic fr actures [27]. FDG-PET/CT can be used to further assess suspected pathologic fractures of the 
proximal humerus.  
Bone Scan  Shoulder  
Bone scintigraphy has sensitivity and specificity comparable to MRI in diagnosis of occult bone fractures, and 
bone scintigraphy can be used  to identify other foci of bone involvement in pathologic fractures due to metastatic 
disease  [31,32]. Bone scintigraphy can be used  to characterize proximal humerus fractures suspected to be due to 
metastatic disease.  
Variant 4: Traumatic shoulder pain. Radio graphs show scapula fracture.  Next imaging study. 
There is no consensus on indications for surgical fixation of scapula fractures. In general, isolated scapula body 
fractures heal well without surgical fixation, although associated rib fractures or higher injury severity score are 
associated with worse clinical outcomes and may benefit from more aggressive surgical fixation [ 45]. Scapula 
fractures involving the glenoid articular surface or glenoid neck may also require surgical fixation.  
CT Shoulder  
Because of the scapula’s complex osteology and overlying ribs, scapula fractures can be easily missed or 
underappreciate on conventional radiographs.

Noncontrast MRI is a reasonable imaging study in the setting of acute nonlocalized traumatic shoulder pain and

Variant  1: Superficial soft tissue mass.  Initial imaging.  
The body  regions  covered  in this clinical  scenario  include  the neck,  chest,  abdomen,  pelvis,  humerus/upper  arm, 
shoulder, elbow,  forearm,  wrist,  hand,  hip, femur/thigh, knee,  tibia/lower  leg, ankle,  and foot. 
Radiography Area  of Interest  
Initial imaging  assessment  of a suspected  musculoskeletal  soft tissue mass  should almost  invariably  begin with 
radiographic  evaluation  and is advocated  by the European Society  for Medical  Oncology– European Reference  
Network  Clinical Practice  Guidelines  for rare adult  solid  cancers (ESMO -EURACAN)  [9]. Although often  
considered  unrewarding  by clinicians  without  musculoskeletal  expertise,  a study of the radiogra phic evaluation  of 
454 patients  with proven  soft tissue masses demonstrated  positive  results in 62% of cases,  with calcification  
identified  in 27% of cases,  bone  involvement  in 22% of cases,  and intrinsic  fat in 11% of cases [10]. Specifically,  
radiographic  findings  can be diagnostic  or highly  character istic,  such as in the identification  of phleboliths  within  a 
hemangioma,  the osteocartilaginous  masses  of synovial  chondromatosis,  or the peripherally  more  mature  
ossification  of myositis  ossificans,  to name  just a few. In addition, radiographs  can be diagnostic  of an unsuspected  
skeletal  abnormality  or deformity  that may manifest  as a soft tissue mass.

Radiography Area  of Interest  
Initial imaging  assessment  of a suspected  musculoskeletal  soft tissue mass  should almost  invariably  begin with 
radiographic  evaluation  and is advocated  by ESMO -EURACAN [9]. Radiographs  remain  the modality  best suited  
for the initial assessment  of a suspected  soft tissue mass  and are the initial study  of choice for orthopedic  oncologists  
[25,26] . However,  radiographs  have  limitations  and may not reveal  an abnormality  when  a mass is small, deep -
seated,  nonmineralized,  or in an area with complex  anatomy  such as the flank,  paraspinal  region,  groin,  or deep  soft 
tissues of the hands  and feet [11]. 
US Area  of Interest  
The diagnostic  accuracy  of US is considerably  less when  lesions outside  the subcutaneous tissue are included.  It is 
also less reliable  for defining deep  masses in large anatomical  areas [27]. Although a recent  prospective  study of 
US accuracy  in the characterization  of 134 histologically  proven  deep  soft tissue masses showed  promising results,  
there were only a small  number  of malignancies in the study cohort , and the investigators  had a high level  of US

Clinical concern includes sesamoiditis, Morton’s  neuroma, intermetatarsal bursitis, chronic plantar plate

Bone Scan Foot  
Planar b one scintigraphy has low anatomic resolution and has been shown to be a nonspecific technique to assess 
the hallucal sesamoids [24]. However, bone scintigraphy with single -photon emission computed tomography 
(SPECT)/CT increases contrast resolution and anatomic localization of foci with increased osteoblastic activity  
[25]. Bone scintigraphy may demonstrate increased uptake in pathologic conditions affecting the fir st metatarsal 
sesamoids not evident on radiographs. A less dramatic uptake is noted in stress fractures, which may be helpful to 
differentiate between them and acute fractures [26]. When an indeter minate linear lucency is visualized on 
radiographs, a negative bone scintigraphy suggest s sesamoid bipartition [12] . Other conditions that may present 
positive findings on Tc -99m -methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scint igraphy include sesamoiditis, 
inflammatory or deposition arthropathies, osteoarthritis , and osteonecrosis [39]. In Freiberg’s infraction, a 
photopenic center with a hyperactive collar may be identified on early stages on high -resolution Tc -99m -MDP bone 
scintigraphy [27]. 
CT Foot  
CT may be useful to confirm suspected sesamoid stress fractures on radiographs and to distinguish between a stress 
fracture and a bipartite sesamoid with more precision than conventional radiography [28] .

imaging typically  consists of a 3-view study  with the possibility  of additional  views as indicated  by the clinical  
setting  [8]. Additional  views,  such as axial  calcaneal  view,  can be useful  in patients  with suspected  calcaneal

distinguishing intra-articular  calcaneal  fractures.

Radiography Foot  
Conventional radiography can be useful to distinguish among different causes of chronic foot pain and is usually 
the first imag ing study in evaluating patients with chronic foot pain.  
The value of radiographs in the diagnosis of tarsal coalitions has been extensively demonstrated. Overall 
sensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs 
in the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral 
and oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar 
coalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs 
on the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have 
been found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable 
methods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  
Radiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review 
by Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for 
radiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.

usually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, 
osteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite 
versus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess 
with radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton’s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other 
causes of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg’s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals 
or soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . 
Though radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in 
patients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The 
combination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a

The most commonly used imaging techniques in the diagnosis of Morton’s  neuroma  are MRI and US. It has been 
shown that MRI has a significant effect in the diagnostic and therapeutic decisions made by orthopedic surgeons 
thanks to an increase in their confidence levels and change in treatment [34] . MRI is believed to be a sensitive and 
reliable method to evaluate patients with metatarsalgia and Morton’s  neuroma  with a sensitivity of 87%, specificity 
of 100%, accuracy of 89%, PPV of 100% , and NPV of 60% in surgically treated patients [35] . In a meta- analysis,  
MRI had  a pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio , and negative likelihood ratio of 93%, 68%, 1.89,  
and 0.19, respectively [36]. Increased fluid within the intermetatarsal bursa, which suggest s bursitis, is well 
demonstrated on MRI [37] . Although the use of gadolinium does not seem essential to detect Morton’s  neuroma s 
[38], it may facilitate its detection  because of  the improved soft -tissue contrast [32,39] . 
MRI is widely accepted as the imaging study  of choice for diagnosis of plantar plate tears. In a prospective study, 
Sung et al [40] found high accuracy (96%), sensitivity (95%), specificity (100%), PPV (100%), and NPV (67%) for 
MRI with surgical correlation. In this study,  moderate concordance was found between tear severity on MR I and 
surgery with greater concordance at higher severity. A meta-analysis showed higher diagnostic accuracy for MRI 
than US for the detection of plantar plate tears with sensitivity and specificity for MRI of 95% and 54%, respectively 
[41].

Page Content: Although there is no relevant literature  to support the routine clinical use of US in the 
diagnosis of CRPS type II, high-resolu tion US may have a role giving its increasing use in nerve assessment [23] . 
Variant 3: Chronic metatarsalgia including plantar great toe pain. Radiographs negative or equivocal. 
Clinical concern includes sesamoiditis, Morton’s  neuroma, intermetatarsal bursitis, chronic plantar plate 
injury, or Freiberg’s infraction. Next imaging study.  
Bone Scan Foot  
Planar b one scintigraphy has low anatomic resolution and has been shown to be a nonspecific technique to assess 
the hallucal sesamoids [24]. However, bone scintigraphy with single -photon emission computed tomography 
(SPECT)/CT increases contrast resolution and anatomic localization of foci with increased osteoblastic activity  
[25]. Bone scintigraphy may demonstrate increased uptake in pathologic conditions affecting the fir st metatarsal 
sesamoids not evident on radiographs. A less dramatic uptake is noted in stress fractures, which may be helpful to 
differentiate between them and acute fractures [26]. When an indeter minate linear lucency is visualized on 
radiographs, a negative bone scintigraphy suggest s sesamoid bipartition [12] . Other conditions that may present 
positive findings on Tc -99m -methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scint igraphy include sesamoiditis, 
inflammatory or deposition arthropathies, osteoarthritis , and osteonecrosis [39]. In Freiberg’s infraction, a 
photopenic center with a hyperactive collar may be identified on early stages on high -resolution Tc -99m -MDP bone 
scintigraphy [27]. 
CT Foot  
CT may be useful to confirm suspected sesamoid stress fractures on radiographs and to distinguish between a stress 
fracture and a bipartite sesamoid with more precision than conventional radiography [28] .

Page Content: Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  
usually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, 
osteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite 
versus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess 
with radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton’s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other 
causes of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg’s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals 
or soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . 
Though radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in 
patients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The 
combination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a 
specificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15]. 
US Foot  
Ultrasound (US) is usually not indicate d as the first imaging  study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain, but may 
be performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of pathologic conditions of the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia,

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 9 Stress (Fatigue/Insufficiency) Fracture  [8]. Detection of osseous change is more limited in areas covered by prominent overlapping soft tissue [17]. If the 
osseous reaction involve s cortical bone, then endosteal/periosteal callus may be visible with or without a fracture 
line through the cortex. If the trabecular bone is involved, then stress fractures are often more  subtle, progressing 
from patchy areas of increased density into linear areas of sclerosis, oriented perpendicular to the trabeculae.  
Although bone scans were regarded as the gold-standard examination for many years, MRI is extremely sensitive 
and demonstrates stress abnormalities as early as bone scintigraphy  and with as much sensitivity  [11-14] . The 
recent literature favors MRI as the procedure of choice for making an early diagnosis of both varieties of stress 
fractures [15-28]. In this regard, MRI outperforms radiography,  bone scintigraphy, and CT. Furthermore, MRI 
examination of an osseous stress injury contains  prognostic as well as diagnostic information  [30,31]. 
CT is not typically used as a first - or second -line imaging tool  but may offer an adjunctive role when other 
imaging modalities are equivocal  [23]. Although  superior to radiography, it is less sensitive than nuclear 
scintigraphy and MRI  [19]. 
Stress fractures in the femur most often occur in the femoral neck and represent up to 7% of all stress fractures  
[39]. Lateral “tension -type ” femoral neck stress fractures are inherently unstable and prone to displacement  [40] 
and are high-risk fractures, often necessitating percutaneous screw fixation  [41]. Medial “compression -type ” 
femoral n eck stress fractures are low risk [40] and can be treated with a non– weight -bearing  regimen  [42].

Page Content: Furthermore, MRI may als o demonstrate other reasons for occult pelvic pain, such as soft -tissue abnormalities or 
the subchondral hip or supra -acetabular stress fractures described in some osteoporotic patients [63]. The clinical 
differential diagnosis includes sacroiliitis from inflammatory or infectious causes, osteitis condensans ilii, and 
lumbosacral degenerative spondylosis  [60]. 
Variant 12: Suspect stress (fatigue or insufficiency) fracture of the long bones . Pregn ant patient. 
See variant 11. In the case of long bones, the fetus’ absorbed dose from radiography and CT will be substantially 
lower. Women can be reassured that benefit far outweighs the risk wi th regard to diagnostic imaging, as all 
radiographs and CT sc ans not involving the abdomen or pelvis hav e a predicted fetal absorbed dose of less than 1 
mGy  [80]. Radiographs should be the initial imaging evaluation because findings may be conclusive , in which 
case no further imaging should be performed. MRI does not use ionizing radiation and can  be used  as necessary to 
make the diagnosis.  
Summary of Recommendations  
• In the setting of a suspected fatigue fracture, the initial imaging test should be radiography of the area of 
interest, although it is not a sensitive examination. 
• If there is clinical concern  for a fatigue fracture of the hip and initial radiographs are negative, MRI without 
contrast should be performed because of the high risk of complications.  
• In the setting of a suspected fatigue fracture in a location other than the hip with initial negati ve radiographs, 
either repeat radiographs in 10  to 14 days or MRI without contrast may be appropriate depending on the 
location of pain and relative risk of complications secondary to stress fractures in that area.  
• If there is an immediate need -to-know sit uation to diagnose a stress fracture in the setting of negative 
radiographs, for example,  professional football player, then MRI w ithout contrast is recommended.

Page Content: Furthermore, certain athletic activities often result in specific sites of fatigue  fracture, such as olecranon process 
fractures in javelin throwers and baseball pitchers, proximal femur and tibial stress fractures in runners, and  tarsal  
navicular stress fractures in basketball players [ 36-38] . Correlat ion of  clinical history, pattern , and site recognition 
with radiographic findings  is usually specific [1,2,4,5,7]. Nevertheless, stress fractures are frequently occult on 
initial radiographs  [1], with conventional radiographs having a sensitivity of 15% to 35% [8]. Early radiographic 
findings are often nonspecific (subtle periosteal reaction , gray cortex sign) or even nonexistent. Late radiographic 
findings are often suggestive in appearance  and include  linear sclerosis (often perpe ndicular to the major 
trabecular lines), periosteal reaction , patchy endosteal sclerosis, and soft -tissue swelling . Additionally, 
radiographs may remain negative depending on the timing of re imaging , the patient’s metabolic bone status, and 
the type and lo cation of the fracture. Thus, radiographs are specific but significantly insensitive. Despite this 
limitation, all authorities agree that radiographs should be the initial imaging modality; if the findings are 
conclusive, no further imaging need be perform ed. 
Variant 2: S uspected stress (fatigue) fracture, hip. Negative radiographs. Next imaging study.   
Short -term (10  to 14 days) follow -up radiographs are more sensitive than initial radiographs secondary to overt 
bone reaction in the location of the stress fracture. Follow -up radiographic sensitivity increases to 30 % to 70%

Page Content: Finally, stress fractures of the femoral head are high  risk in healthy patients and , if not recognized promptly, have 
increased  rates of delayed union, nonunion, displacement, and avascular necrosis [17]. Given the importance of 
recognizing these high-risk fractures in the femoral head and neck, MRI is the preferred second -line study after  
initial negative  radiographs to prevent delayed diagnosis.  
Variant 3: Suspected stress (fatigue) fracture, excluding hip  and vertebrae. Negative radiographs. Next 
imaging study.  
See variant 2. Certain stress fractures are considered high  risk based on a tendency for nonunion or delayed union. 
High -risk stress fractures include the anterior tibial diaphysis, lateral femoral neck and femoral head (see variant 
2), patella, medial malleolus, navicular, fifth metatarsal base, proximal second metatarsal, tibial hallux sesamoid, 
and talus  [43]. 
The second -line test to diagnose a stress fracture should be guided by the location of the patient ’s pain and 
likelihood of high-risk injury. A follow -up radiographic examination has increased sensitivity compared to initial 
radiographs [8] but is less sensitive than MRI. MRI is extremely sensitive and demonstrates stress abnormalities 
as early as bone scintigraphy and with as much sensitivity [ 11-14]. The recent literature favors MRI as the 
procedure of choice for making an early diagnosis of both varieties of stress fractures [ 15-28 ]. MRI is also 
considerably more specifi c than bone scintigraphy [ 19,23]. Stress injuries in athletes that are not identified and 
managed in a timel y fashion can progress to more serious fractures. Preventive strategies, including identifying 
and modifying risk factors, may help deter progression to frank fractures [31,44,45]. 
A circumstance that deserves specific attention is the longitudinal stress fracture, particularly in the tibia. Up to 
25% may appear n ormal on radiographs, but CT or MRI findings are characteristic [ 13,46].

to-play” evaluation . 
See variants 1  through  3. On initial diagnosis, MRI can be used to  predict t ime to return to play in athletes. 
Fredericson et al  [48] retrospectively correlated return to activity with an MRI grading system based on the 
pattern of periosteal and marrow edema on T1-weighted  and fat -suppressed T 2-weighted sequences. Similar 
findings were confirmed in other studies  [49-51] , including  that the finding of abnormal cortical signal intensity 
or a fracture line was of prognostic value [ 51] and that MRI performed better in predicting return to activity than 
radiographs , bone scintigraphy, or CT [50,52]. 
A recent prospective study in university athletes found that MRI grading s everity, total-body bone mineral density 
evaluated by dual -energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and location of injury (ie , cortical or trabecular bone)  
were important variables for predicting time to full return to sport [ 31]. In this study, periosteal edema as 
described by Fredericson et al [ 48] was not associated with return to sport . Using the modified grading scale and a 
multiple regression model, for every 1- unit increase in MRI grade, the time to full return to sport increased by 
approximately 48 days [31] . Furthermore, trabecular st ress injuries (eg , femur neck and pubic bone ) were 
associated with a longer time to return to sport than cortical bone stress injuries. In addition, decreased bone 
mineral density leads to increased time to return to sport . Therefore, bone mineral density provides additional 
diagnostic and prognostic information [31]. The model of MRI  grade, trabecular versus cortical bone sit e, and 
total-body bone mineral density a ccounted for 68% of the variation in time to return to sport [ 31].",True

changes of the foot in patients  with  diabetes mellitus. Additional imaging  following  radiographs.  
The likelihood  of developing osteomyelitis  without  an associated  wound or ulceration  is extremely  low. Almost  
all osteomyelitis  and soft-tissue abscesses of the diabetic  foot represent  areas of contiguous  infection  from  
adjacent  skin ulcerations and not hematogenous  seeding  [14]. Any imaging modality  performed  for this variant  
should be able to identify  soft-tissue infections,  tumors  and abscesses,  early  neuropathic  arthropathy,  or subtle  
fractures not revealed  on initial radiographs . Diabetic foot osteomyelitis  and neuroarthropathy  can be difficult  to 
differentiate  clinically.  The early  diagnosis  of neuropathic  disease prior  to the development  of radiographic  
change  is important, as these  patients  will be treated  with altered  footwear  and orthotics  to prevent  the progression  
to deformity.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 12 Suspected Spine Trauma However, there are no widely accepted criteria for grading th e severity of cervical spine soft-tissue injury on MRI, 
and while MRI has been shown to have high sensitivity fo r identifying soft-tissue inju ries of the cervical spine, 
the specificity of MRI for identifying clinically signifi cant cervical soft-tissue injuries is only modest. In a 2015 
study by Zhuge et al [62], MRI demonstrated 100% sensitiv ity for diagnosis of injury to the cervical paraspinal 
muscles, intervertebral disc, and interspinous ligament but  with specificities of only 77%, 71%, and 64% for these 
structures, respectively. Therefore, care should be taken in  interpretation of soft-tissue injuries identified on MRI. 
Variant 5: Age greater than or equal to 16 years. Susp ected acute cervical spine blunt trauma. Clinical or 
imaging findings suggest arterial injury with or wi thout positive cervical spine CT. Next imaging study. 
Arterial injury can be a concern in blunt and penetrating spinal injury. An estimated 1% to 3% of blunt trauma 
patients are diagnosed with cerebrovascular injury  [63,64]. These injuries can include transection, 
pseudoaneurysm formation, and simple dissection. Di ssections and pseudoaneurysms  may or may not produce 
stenosis and flow limitation of the affected artery. The presence of dissection in itself is generally taken to 
represent a risk of thrombus forma tion and subsequent embolization. 
Many different head and neck injury patterns and c linical symptoms have been associated with blunt 
cerebrovascular injuries (BCVIs) [52,53,63-68]. Up to two-th irds of patients with BCVIs may be asymptomatic at 
presentation [65] and not develop stroke-like symptoms for 48 to 72 hours after initial blunt trauma injury [63,64]. 
Screening for BCVI is ideally performed  to appropriately initiate anticoagul ation therapy prior to the patient 
developing neurologic deficits.

Page Content: Furthermore, MRI has been found to have low (64% to 77%) specificity in identifying clinically significant 
interspinous ligament, intervertebral disc, and paraspinal muscle injury [62]. 
While not limited to obtunded patients, recent prospectiv e multicenter trials suggest that MRI has a role in 
evaluating patients who have a negative cervical spine CT. The Western Trauma Association Multi-Institutional 
trial reported that CT was effective for ruling out clinically  significant injury with a sensitivity of 98.5%. A small 
but clinically significant incidence of a missed injury was noted [56]. The prospective ReCONECT trial studied 
767 patients who had a negative cervical spine CT and we nt on to MRI because of cervicalgia (43.0%), inability 
to evaluate (44.1%), or both (9.4%). MRI was abnormal in 23.6% of all patients, including ligamentous injury 
(16.6%), soft-tissue swelling (4.3%), vertebral disc injury  (1.4%), and dural hematomas (1.3%). The patients with 
abnormal MRI were less likely to have their cervical colla r removed than those with normal MRI (13.3% versus 
88.1%). Eleven patients underwent cervical spine surgery af ter the MRI results. The clin ical significance of these 
abnormal MRI findings could not be determined from this study group [55]. By inference, it is likely that some 
obtunded patients with negative cervical spine CT will have abnormal MRI, and some of these MRI-detected 
injuries may require treatment.

A comprehensive literature review of thoracolumbar trau ma was performed by Hsu et al [19] in 2003 with the 
conclusion that patients should undergo im aging of the thoracolumbar spine if  the following criteria were present: 
(1) back pain or midline tenderness, (2) local signs of thoracolumbar injury, (3) abnormal neurological signs, (4) 
cervical spine fracture, (5) Glasgow Coma  Scale score (GCS) <15, (6) major distracting injury, or (7) alcohol or 
drug intoxication. A prospective study by Holmes et al [20] of 152 patients with thoracolumbar spine injury in 2003 found 100% negative predictive value for thoracolumbar spine injury in patients not meeting any of the 
following criteria: (1) complaints of thoracolumbar spine pain, (2) thoracolumb ar spine tenderness, (3) a 
decreased level of consciousness, (4) intoxication with etha nol or drugs, (5) a neurologic deficit, or (6) a painful 
distracting injury. A prospective study of over 3,000 adult blunt trauma patients performed by Inaba et al [21] in 
2015 found 98.9% sensitivity for identifying patients with clin ically significant thoracolumbar spine injury using 
the following criteria: (1) positive physical examination (i ncluding neurologic deficit), (2) high-risk mechanism of 
injury, and (3) ≥60 years of age. It should be noted that in the study by Inaba et al, patients with altered 
consciousness (GCS <15), intoxication, or painful distrac ting injury were excluded from analysis because of their 
inability to perform an adequate examination necessitating imaging clear ance of the thoracolumbar spine. 
However, none of these 3 proposed criteria have  been validated independently (Table 4).

Variant 9: Age greater than or equal to 16 years. Blunt trauma meeting criteria for thoracic and lumbar 
imaging. Initial imaging. 
Imaging is a crucial component in assessment of thoracic and lumbar spine injury. Fr om 1998 to 2011, there was 
an adjusted annual increase of approximately 8% in thor acolumbar spine fractures in patients involved in motor 
vehicle collisions [15]. Thoracolumbar fractures are cha llenging to identify clinically, with only 48% to 75% of 
thoracolumbar injuries identified on clinical examination [16-18]. Unlike cervical injuries, well-defined clinical 
criteria have not been established to determine when thor acolumbar imaging is appropriate in the setting of blunt 
traumatic injury. Since clinical examination has poor sen sitivity for identifying thoracolumbar injuries, any high-
risk patient (mid line thoracolumbar tenderness, high-energ y mechanism of injury, or >60 years of age), as well as 
unexaminable patients (intoxicated, GCS <15, distracting injury), should undergo imaging of the thoracolumbar 
spine. Screening of the entire spine is advised, as an es timated 20% of spine injuries will have a second associated 
spinal injury at a noncontiguous level [26,27]. 
Radiography  Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
It is well established that CT outperforms radiographs in  the diagnosis of thoracolumbar spine fractures [104-
108]. Radiographs have a reported sens itivity of 49% to 62% for identifying thoracic spine fractures and 67% to 
82% sensitivity for identifying lumbar spine fractures [ 104,107,108] compared with the reported sensitivity of 
94% to 100% for identifying thoracolumbar spine fract ures using CT [104,107,108].

CT Myelography Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
CT myelography can be performed to assess for traumatic spinal canal narrowing that is due to disc herniation or 
epidural hematoma and to assess for preganglionic nerve root avulsions. Ho wever, as with conventional CT, CT 
myelography is inferior to MRI in assessing cord contus ion, cord hemorrhage, and postganglionic nerve root 
injuries [40,41,43,57]. Performance of thoracolumbar CT myelogram can also be technically challenging, 
particularly in patients with suspected  unstable thoracolumbar spine injury. 
CT Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
CT does play a role in the initial assessment of thoracic and lumbar spine injury. However, CT is significantly 
inferior to MRI in identifying many soft-tissue pathologies,  such as cord contusion, epidural hematoma, and nerve 
root avulsions that can cause neurologic deficits re quiring surgical intervention [40,41,43,57]. Therefore, CT 
should not be considered adequate for excluding signifi cant soft-tissue pathology in patients presenting with 
thoracolumbar spine trauma and neurologic deficit. 
MRI Thoracic and Lumbar Spine 
MRI should be performed in patients who have possible spinal  cord injury, in whom there is clinical concern for 
cord compression that is due to disc protrusion or hema toma, and in those suspected of ligamentous instability. 
MRI is valuable for characterizing the cause of myelopathy in  patients with spinal cord  injury. The severity of the 
injury—including extent of intramedullary hemorrhage , length of edema, and evidence of cord transection—
contributes to predicting outcome.

 Absence of midline cervical spine tenderness 
Thoracic and Lumbar Spine Imaging 
Injuries to the thoracolumbar spine are even more prevalent than cervical spin e injury, with an estimated 4% to 
7% of patients presenting to the emergency department  with blunt trauma sustaining a fracture of the 
thoracolumbar spine [13,14]. An increasing rate of t horacolumbar spine fractures h as been seen in the United 
States over the past several decades, despite a decline in other motor vehicle–related injuries [15]. While the exact 
reason for this increase is uncertain, it is likely due to a combination of both increased detection of thoracolumbar 
spine injury and increased rate of seatbelt injury. Similar to cervical in juries, there is a wide spectrum of 
thoracolumbar spine injuries ranging from stable, minor soft -tissue injuries to unstable fracture dislocations that 
are often accompanied by neurologic injuries. In contrast  to the cervical spine, there are no widely used and 
validated criteria to help determine if th oracolumbar spine imaging is appropriate. 
Clinical examination has a low to very low sensitivit y for identifying thoracolumbar spine injuries [16-18]. 
Therefore, a low threshold should be maintained for screen ing the thoracolumbar spine with imaging in the setting 
of blunt trauma, particularly in older patients, who are at increased risk for spine fractures occurring in the setting 
of low-energy trauma, such as a fall from standing (ie,  fragility fractures), which are due to diminished bone 
mineralization commonly present in older patient populations . A low threshold for imaging of the thoracolumbar",True

bone mass decreases slowly over time, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age, and differs by sex, race, 
ethnicity  [10], and comorbidities. In line with the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations for patients  
ages 65 and older being screened for osteoporosis, patients  >65 years of age may be considered at risk for 
osteoporotic fracture when presenting with LBP . 
Additionally,  for those  patients without  neurologic  compromise  and who present  with minor  risk factors for cancer,  
inflammatory  back  disease  (eg, ankylosing spondylitis), vertebral  compression  fracture,  or symptomatic  spinal  
stenosis,  imaging  should be considered  after a trial of therapy  [4]. 
In the majority  of patients, no specific pathology for LBP can be identified. Also,  studies have  shown  imaging  
abnormalities  in a substantial  number  of people  without back  pain [11-13]. The challenge for the clinician, therefore,  
is to distin guish the small  segment  within  this large patient  population that should be evaluated  further because of 
suspicion  of a more  serious  problem  or identify  pathology that requires intervention . 
Other  nonspine  causes of LBP can have overlap  in clinical  presentation,  including inflammatory  arthritis  and other  
systemic conditions , such as pelvic,  renal,  vascular,  or gastrointestinal  etiologies.  If an inflammatory  etiology  is 
suspected  as the cause of LBP, such as ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic  spondylitis, reactive arthritis, or 
inflammatory  bowel  disease– related  spine  disorders,  please see the ACR  Appropriateness Criteria® topic  on 
“Inflammatory Back Pain: Known or Suspected Axial Spondyloarthropathy ” [14].

Although the utility  of discography in patients  with LBP remains  controversial,  a systematic review by Manchikanti  
et al [32] provides  level  III evidence that lumbar  discography may be useful  in patients  with chronic  discogenic  
LBP. 
FDG -PET/CT  Whole  Body  
There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of whole -body FDG-PET/CT in the evaluation  of a surgery  or 
intervention  candidate with persistent  or progressive  symptoms  during  or following 6 weeks of conservative  
management  [28-30]. 
MRI Lumbar Spine With IV Contrast  
MRI lumbar  spine  with IV contrast  is not typically  performed  independently as an initial study,  as its interpretation  
is most  informative  when  correlated  with standard  noncontrast  sequences included in MRI lumbar  spine  with and 
without  IV contrast  [33]. 
MRI Lumbar Spine Without and With IV Contrast  
MRI with IV contrast  is typically  not necessary  in the evaluation  of a surgical  or interventional candidate with 
persistent  or progressive  symptoms  during or following  6 weeks of conservative management  but is sometimes  
useful  if noncontrast  MRI is nondiagnostic  or indeterminate.  Contrast  can help distinguish  residual/recurrent  disc 
from  fibrosis/scar  in a postoperative  patient  (see Variant  5). 
MRI Lumbar Spine Without IV Contrast  
Patients  presenting  with subacute or chronic  LBP or radiculopathy  who have  failed  6 weeks of conservative therapy , 
and with physical  examination  signs  of nerve  root irritation , should  be imaged  if they are believed  to be candidates 
for surgery  or intervention  or if diagnostic  uncertainty  remains.  Accurate diagnosis  of disc disease can be provided

months  in patients  presenting  with acute LBP compared  with their asymptomatic counterparts , except  in disc 
herniation,  nerve  root compression,  and annular  fissure [15]. Even  in the setting  of disc herniation,  imaging  may 
have  limited  role in management  as the majority  of disc herniations  show  some  degree of reabsorption  or regression  
by 8 weeks after symptom onset  [16]. It is important  to note that repeat  imaging  in patients  with new episodes of

Despite the lack of evidence to support  imaging early  or prior  to conservative treatment  for LBP, there is significant

we will use the Institute  for Clinical Systems  Improvement  definitions  of 0 to 4 weeks to define  acute LBP,  4 to 12 
weeks for subacute LBP, and >12 weeks for chronic  LBP [5]. 
It is clear  that uncomplicated  acute  LBP and/or  radiculopathy is a benign,  self-limited  condition  that does not 
warrant  any imaging studies [4,6,7] . Imaging is considered  in those  patients who have  had up to 6 weeks of medical  
management  and physical  therapy  that resulted  in little or no improvement  in their back  pain.  It is also considered  
for those  patients  presenting  with red flags , raising  suspicion  for a serious underlying  condition,  such as cauda 
equina  syndrome  (CES),  malignancy,  fracture,  or infection  (see Table 1).

management.  Initial imaging.  
In the absence of red flags,  first-line treatment  for chronic  LBP remains conservative therapy  with both 
pharmacologic  and nonpharmacologic  (eg, exercise,  remaining  active)  therapy  [19]. However,  patients  presenting  
with subacute or chronic  LBP, with or without  radiculopathy,  who have  failed  6 weeks of conservative therapy  
should be imaged  if they are believed  to be candidates for surgery  or intervention  or if diagnostic  uncertainty  
remains.  The goal of imaging  is to identify  potential  actionable pain generators that could be targeted  for 
intervention  or surgery.  MRI of the lumbar  spine  has become  the initial imaging  modali ty of choice in these patients. 
MRI has excellent  soft-tissue contrast  and accurately  depicts lumbar  pathology,  including disc degeneration , as well 
as the thecal  sac and neural  structures [7]. However,  it is well known that many  MRI abnormalities  can be seen in 
asymptomatic individuals  and that imaging  patients  in this category  is often  not beneficial  [7,11,13,21] . MRI  may 
be helpful  when  there is LBP with radiculopathy  or signs  of spinal  stenosis,  which  suggests the presence of 
demonstrable  nerve  root compression  [13].

multifocal deficit, or progressive  neurologic  deficit  because of  its ability  to accurately  depict  soft-tissue pathology,  
assess vertebral  marrow,  and assess the spinal  canal  patency.  A prospective  cohort  study by Bell et al [41] 
recommends urgent  MRI assessment  in all patients  who present  with new-onset  urinary  symptoms  in the context  of 
LBP or sciatica.  Recently,  a single  3-D heavily  T2-weighted  fat-saturated  sequence protocol  has been  shown  to be 
a rapid,  highly sensitive tool for evaluating  CES in the emergency  department  that can be utilized  for improved 
efficiency  and emergency  department  throughput  [42]. 
Although MRI  lumbar  spine  without  IV contrast  is the preferred  initial study,  MRI lumbar  spine  without  and with 
IV contrast  may be helpful  to delineate etiology  of CES when  underlying malignancy,  infection, or inflammation  
is clinically suspected (see  Variant  7). 
Although  MRI  is superior  in soft-tissue contrast  and characterizing  the etiology  of CES, CT lumbar  spine  without  
IV contrast  can answer  the question of whether  or not cauda equina  compression  is present.  A recent  retrospective  
review of 151 patients  with clinically  suspected  CES showed  that ≥50%  thecal  sac effacement  on CT predicted  
significant  spinal  stenosis,  and <50%  thecal  sac effacement  reliably  excluded  cauda equina  impingement,  using 
MRI as the reference standard  [27].

Metabolic  causes of chronic  or progressive  myelopathy result  in changes in the spinal  cord known  as subacute

patient  history  is a strong predictor  of patients  who are predisposed  to developing chronic  disabling LBP problems  
[3]. 
Although there  is great  variability  in the definition  of acute and subacute  LBP, for the purposes  of this guideline,  
we will use the Institute  for Clinical Systems  Improvement  definitions  of 0 to 4 weeks to define  acute LBP,  4 to 12 
weeks for subacute LBP, and >12 weeks for chronic  LBP [5]. 
It is clear  that uncomplicated  acute  LBP and/or  radiculopathy is a benign,  self-limited  condition  that does not 
warrant  any imaging studies [4,6,7] . Imaging is considered  in those  patients who have  had up to 6 weeks of medical  
management  and physical  therapy  that resulted  in little or no improvement  in their back  pain.  It is also considered  
for those  patients  presenting  with red flags , raising  suspicion  for a serious underlying  condition,  such as cauda 
equina  syndrome  (CES),  malignancy,  fracture,  or infection  (see Table 1).

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
In the United  States,  acute low back  pain (LBP),  with or without radiculopathy , is the leading  cause of years lived  
with disability  and the third  ranking cause of disability -adjusted  life years  [1]. It is the fifth most  common  reason  
for a physician  visit in the United  States  and accounts for approximately  3% of visits  to the emergency  department  
[2]. 
The American  College  of Physicians and the American  Pain Society  classify  LBP into the following  broad  
categories:  nonspecific LBP, back  pain potentially  associated  with radiculopathy or spinal  stenosis,  and back  pain 
potentially  associated  with another  specific spinal  cause [3].

bone mass decreases slowly over time, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age, and differs by sex, race, 
ethnicity  [10], and comorbidities. In line with the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations for patients  
ages 65 and older being screened for osteoporosis, patients  >65 years of age may be considered at risk for 
osteoporotic fracture when presenting with LBP . 
Additionally,  for those  patients without  neurologic  compromise  and who present  with minor  risk factors for cancer,  
inflammatory  back  disease  (eg, ankylosing spondylitis), vertebral  compression  fracture,  or symptomatic  spinal  
stenosis,  imaging  should be considered  after a trial of therapy  [4]. 
In the majority  of patients, no specific pathology for LBP can be identified. Also,  studies have  shown  imaging  
abnormalities  in a substantial  number  of people  without back  pain [11-13]. The challenge for the clinician, therefore,  
is to distin guish the small  segment  within  this large patient  population that should be evaluated  further because of 
suspicion  of a more  serious  problem  or identify  pathology that requires intervention . 
Other  nonspine  causes of LBP can have overlap  in clinical  presentation,  including inflammatory  arthritis  and other  
systemic conditions , such as pelvic,  renal,  vascular,  or gastrointestinal  etiologies.  If an inflammatory  etiology  is 
suspected  as the cause of LBP, such as ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic  spondylitis, reactive arthritis, or 
inflammatory  bowel  disease– related  spine  disorders,  please see the ACR  Appropriateness Criteria® topic  on 
“Inflammatory Back Pain: Known or Suspected Axial Spondyloarthropathy ” [14].

Initial imaging  is defined  as imaging  at the beginning of the care episode for the medical  condition defined  by the

MRI Cervical Spine  
MRI is the most sensitive test for detecting soft  abnormalities asso ciated with neck pain; however, this is 
characterized by a high rate of abnormalities in asymptomatic individuals [22 ,23]. As such, MRI is not considered 
a first -line imaging modality in the setting of acute or worsening uncompl icated neck pain.

Page Content: Radiculopathies  may result  from  compressive causes  related to narrowing of the neural foramina, such as by facet 
or uncovertebral joint hypertrophy, or from associated dis c bulging or herniation  and degenerative spondylosis  in 
the absence of a history  of diabetes or red flag symptom s [31].  A recent meta-analysis assessing the positive 
predictive value of physical examination tests in the setting of a clinical history of cervical radiculopathy 
concluded there was limited evidence for a correlation between physical examination findings and MRI evidence 
of cervical nerve root compression [32].  This may be due to a high rate of both false -positive and false-negative 
findings on MRI in the setting of suspected cervical radiculopathy [33 ]. Most cases of acute cervical neck pain 
with radicular symptoms resolve spontaneously or with conse rvative treatment measures [31, 34]. 
In absence of red flag symptoms, imaging may not be required at time of initial presentation [1 ] as spondylotic 
changes are commonly identified on radi ographs and MRI in patients >30 years of age and correlate poorly with 
the presence of neck pain [20-23]. Although the diagnostic accuracy of red flag symptoms is not validated for the 
cervical spine, the Bone  and Joint  Decade 2000 -2010 Task Force on Neck Pain and Its Associated Disorders [1] 
recommended the adoption of a similar system for cervical and neck pain, with red flags that include  trauma, 
malignancy, prior neck surgery, spinal cord injury, systemic diseases —inclu ding ankylosing spondylitis, diffuse 
idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, inflammatory arthritis, suspected infection —history of intravenous drug use, 
intractable pain despite therapy, or tenderness to palpation over a vertebral body. Additional proposed red flags include congenital findings, concomitant vascular disease in patients >50 years of age, abnormal labs (erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate, C -reactive protein level, white blood cell), and neurological deficits [10
].

MRA Neck  
The literature search did not identify a ny studies regarding the use of MRA in the evaluation of this clinical

MRI Cervical Spine  
In patients with neck pain without neurologic symptoms, the relevance of specific MRI findings in the cervical 
spine should be considered in light of ex pected changes associated with aging. MRI is more sensitive than  CT in 
identifying degenerative  cervical  disorders  [111, 112]. However, the presence of degenerative changes should be 
interpreted with caution. In a small series, Fryer et al [113 ] found little correlation between the presence of facet 
arthropathy and the side or level of symptoms in patients with acute, unilateral neck pain.  Spondylotic changes on 
radiographs and MRI are comm on in patients over 30 years of age and have been shown to correlate poorly with 
the presence of neck pain [20-23, 114,115]. Okada et al [112],  in a 10-year  longitudinal  MRI study,  showed  that 
cervical  disc degeneration  progressed  in 85% of patients,  though symptoms  developed in only 34% of patients.  
Most  significantly, patients  developing symptoms  showed  more  frequent  progression  of disc degeneration  on 
MRI,  including anterior  compression  of the dura and spin al cord, posterior disc protrusion, disc space narrowing,  
and foraminal  stenosis.  
Bone Scan Whole Body with SPECT or SPECT/CT Neck  
The role of Tc-99m  bone  scan in the setting  of chronic  neck  pain is limited, though SPECT likely  offers  benefit  
over conventional  planar  imaging.  Some  authors  have  advocated  the use of SPECT imaging  in identifying  the 
pain source (ie, facet  disease)  [

both the flexor and extensor wrist compartments [46]. Occult ganglion cysts are also easily identified with MRI, 
but some authors recommend use of IV contrast to distinguish ganglia from synovitis [ 47]. For noncystic soft-
tissue masses, MRI may demonstrate findings that are diagnostic for certain benign conditions (eg, lipomas, 
hemangiomas, benign nerve sheath tumors), and can stage the extent of involvement for nonspecific masses ( see 
the ACR Appropriateness Criteria® topic on “ Soft-Tissue Masses ” [48]). 
US Wrist  
Wrist US or MRI (without or without  and with IV contrast) are alternative initial examinations that are usually

[17],  with an accuracy similar to that  of MRI.  
CT Wrist  
There is no support in the literature for CT in the initial diagnosis of a palpable mass or suspected ganglion cyst

early RA is proving to be the best single predictor of future disease progression and functional dete rioration, even 
compared to serologies and clinical measures [27, 28,32-34].  
US Wrist  
The diagnosis of a specific inflammatory arthritis is typically established based on clinical and laboratory 
analysis. Advanced imaging is usually performed to determine disease activity, guide management decisions, and prognosticate outcomes. In patients with RA, US  of the wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints can  show 
inflammation  as active synovitis. Identifying active synovitis with power Doppler assessment is a useful adjunct 
in making an early diagnosis of RA when a pati ent with early arthritis does not meet the 2010 criteria established 
by the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism [20]. The presence of 
synovitis predicts progression of erosions [31 ] and erosions themselves [35]. US can also depict small bone 
erosions with high spatial resolution; h owever, US is less sensitive to erosions that occur on the radial or ulnar 
sides of the inner carpal bones because direct scanning of these regions is blocked, unlike the dorsal and volar 
bone surfaces. Furthermore, unlike MRI, US cannot show changes within the bone marrow, which are  the 
strongest prognosticator s for disease progression in RA [27, 28,32-34].  In patients with established inflammatory 
arthritis who are undergoing therapy, judging progression or reduction of synovitis may be more difficult with 
sequential US compared to sequential MRI.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
MR arthrography does not contribute to the diagnosis or management of patients with suspected inflammatory 
arthritides. 
CT Wrist  
While CT is more sensitive than radiographs for erosions, CT is not routinely used for the diagnosis and 
management of patients with suspected inflammatory arthritides .

confident early diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment guidance in these patients  [27,28]. Additionally, 
inflammatory tenosynovitis may be more conspicuous after IV  contrast administration [29]. As is the case for any 
tomographic study, MRI is much more sensitive than radiographs for identifying erosions in RA [30 ,31]. More

Variant 4: Chronic wrist pain. Radiographs normal or show nonspecific ar thritis. Exclude infection. Next

Aspiration  Wrist  
No literature directly addresses the appropriateness of imaging studies beyond radiographs in patients with 
suspected infection in the wrist. However, generalizing from experience with septic arthrit is in other joints, joint 
aspiration should not be delayed in order to obtain advanced imaging studies. In cases of suspected septic arthritis, 
percutaneous aspiration of the wrist is indicated, even when radiographs appear normal. Aspirates should be 
analyzed by cell count, gram stain, and appropriate cultures. Microscopic crystal analysis should also be obtained 
if there is a possibility of gout, acute pseudogout, or hydroxyapatite deposition disease. Aspiration can be 
performed without imaging guidance i f the joint is distended, but either fluoroscopy or US  may be useful if a 
specific compartment is to be targeted.  
MRI Wrist  
There may be a role for MRI with IV contrast enhancement in the staging of infections (for example, to delineate the location and extent of soft-tissue abscesses)  after aspiration has been performed.  Especially in chronic cases, 
MRI with IV contrast may be useful to identify a fluid collection or joint effusion to target  for aspiration.  
However, MRI is usually not appropriate as the next study after radiographs for suspected wrist infections.  
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
MR arthrography is not routinely used to evaluate suspected wrist infection.

MRI Wrist  
Both traumatic and degenerative lesions of the TFCC can produce chronic, ulnar -sided wrist pain . MRI is highly 
accurate for lesions involving the radial (central) zone of the disc, especially with the use of high -resolution fast 
spin-echo or 3-D grad ient-recalled pulse sequences [36]. There is some evidence suggesting that MRI performed 
with a 3.0 T system is even more accurate than MRI performed with a 1.5 T system for TFCC lesions [37], but 
there are no studies comparing the accuracy of the two field s trengths in the same patients. The sensitivity for 
tears of the ulnar attachment of the disc and the peripheral attachments (the ulnocarpal ligaments) are only fair 
with noncontrast -enhanced wrist MRI [ 12,36]. IV contrast seldom provides added benefit in patients with ulnar -
sided wrist pain but may increase sensitivity for TFCC lesions if MR arthrography is desired but direct joint 
injection is not feasible.",False

CT Area  of Interest  Without IV Contrast  
CT is less sensitive  than bone  scintigraphy  and MRI  for the detection  of early  osteonecrosis [36]. Once an 
insufficiency  fracture  occurs,  CT is superior  to MRI in showing  location  and extent  of articular  collapse [37,38] . 
CT also shows osseous details  of secondary  osteoarthritis  well. 
MRI Area  of Interest  Without  and With  IV Contrast  
MRI with dynamic  contrast  enhancement  has been  shown  to be useful  to differentiate  osteonecrosis from  transient  
bone  marrow  edema  syndrome  and subchondral  insufficiency  fracture  [39]. Transient  bone  marrow  edema show s 
subchondral  spot of marked  hyperperfusion (plasma flow) , whereas osteonecrosis  shows a rim of high plasma flow 
surrounding a subchondral  area without  flow [40]. This rim is thought  to represent  granulation  tissue.  Higher  slope  
of enhancement  and maximum enhancement  in epiphysis  was seen in transient  bone  marrow  edema than in 
subchondral  fracture.  Osteonecrosis showed  overall  decreased  maximal  enhancement  [41].

positio n and stability  of the prosthesis.  
3-Phase  Bone  Scan  Knee  
Radionuclide  3-phase bone  scans can demonstrate  increased  activity  at a site of periprosthetic  fracture  and can show  
fractures that are radiographically occult  [137, 138]. In older  osteopen ic individuals  with low rates  of bone  
remodeling,  it may take 48 to 72 hours  for the development  of increased  radionuclide  activity  at the site of fracture.  
Within  1 to 2 years after prosthesis surgery,  the differential  diagnosis  for increased  periprosthetic  activity  would  
include  postoperative  change;  however,  with serial  imaging,  this postoperative activity  should decrease over time,  
whereas activity  increasing  over time would be suggestive of a prosthetic  complication, such as a periprosthetic  
fracture,  aseptic loosening,  or infection. Therefore,  no conclusion should  be drawn  on an isolated  bone  scan unless 
it yields  a normal  study.  
CT Arthrography  Knee  
There is no benefit  to intraarticular  contrast.  
CT Knee  With  IV Contrast  
IV contrast  is not helpful  for CT assessment  of periprosthetic  fracture.  
CT Knee  Without and With  IV Contrast  
IV contrast  is not helpful  for CT assessment  of periprosthetic  fracture.  
CT Knee  Without IV Contrast  
Radiographically occult  fractures may be detected  on CT when  metal  artifact  reduction  techniques  are used [20].

There is no relevant  literature  to support  the use of CT lumbar  spine  without  and with IV contrast  in the evaluation  
of a surgery  or intervention  candidate with persistent  or progressive symptoms  during or following  6 weeks of 
conservative management . 
CT Lumbar Spine Without IV Contrast  
CT lumbar  spine without  IV contrast  may be useful  for preoperative  planning [26]. CT delineates osseous  margins  
and aids in trajectory  planning  for hardware fixation . Additionally,  CT lumbar  spine  without  IV contrast  can be 
used to assess facets and neural  foramina  in patients  who cannot  undergo MRI and is equal  to MRI for predicting  
significant  spinal  stenosis and excluding cauda equina  impingement  [27]. 
CT Myelography Lumbar  Spine  
CT myelography of the lumbar  spine  can be useful  in assessing  the patency  of the spinal  canal/thecal  sac and of the 
subarticular  recesses and neural  foramen  [22]. It has safety  advantages over MRI  for patients  who have  implanted  
medical  devices that are not MRI safe or conditional  and can be useful  in patients  with significant  artifact  from  
metallic  surgical  hardware on MRI [23]. CT myelography has the disadvantage  of requiring lumbar  puncture  for 
intrathecal  injection  of myelographic  contrast  [22].

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness  Criteria® 15 Low Back  Pain MRI lumbar  spine  without  IV contrast  is useful  in determining  the acuity  of a vertebral  fracture,  as evidenced  by 
bone  marrow  edema and in demonstrating spinal  canal  compromise,  for example from  displaced  or retropulsed  
fractures.  For imaging  evaluation  and management  of vertebral  compression  fractures,  please see the ACR 
Appropriateness Criteria® topic on “ Management of Vertebral  Compression  Fractures ” for guidance [57]. 
Additionally,  the distinction  between  malignant  and benign  compression  fractures  can be assessed  on MRI.  The 
visualization  of the convex posterior  vertebral  body  border,  extension into the posterior  elements,  and abnormal  
marrow  signal  are suggestive  of pathologic  fracture  [58]. 
CT myelography of the lumbar  spine  assess the patency  of the spinal  canal/thecal  sac and of the subarticular  recesses  
and neural  foramen  [22]. It can be useful  in patients  with osteoporotic  fracture  with neurologic  deficit . This modality  
has the disadvantage  of lumbar  puncture  and injection  of intrathecal  contrast  [22]. 
Bone  scan with SPECT/CT is usually  not used for initial imaging  but can be useful  for radiographically occult  
fractures and can be used to evaluate acuity  of vertebral  fracture . [59]. 
Whole -body FDG-PET/CT is typically  not an initial imaging study,  but as a follow -up study , it can help distinguish  
between  benign and pathologic  compression  fractures  when  other  imaging modalities  are indeterminate  [60].

• Variant  1: When  a new,  symptomatic  VCF  is identified  on radiographs  with no history  of malignancy,  either  
CT or MRI of the spine  without  IV contrast  is recommended  as the next imaging  study to differentiate  between  
acute/subacute and chronic  fractures and to evaluate for complications . Either  procedure  can be performed,  but 
they may be complementary  when  knowledge  of bony anatomy  is relevant  to treatment  planning.  Bone  scan,  
SPECT, or SPECT/CT of the whole  spine  may be appropriate  as complementary  alternatives  in cases in which 
there are multiple  fractures or concern  for more  widespread  distribution  of fractures.  
• Variant  2: When  a new,  symptomatic  VCF  is identified  on radiographs  with a history  of malignancy,  both CT 
of the spine  without  IV contrast,  or MRI  of the spine  either  without  or with and without  IV contrast  is 
recommended  as the next imaging  study to differentiate  between  acute/subacute and chronic  fractures , 
enhancing tumor,  and to evaluate for complications . Either  procedure  can be performed,  but they may also be 
complementary  when  knowledge  of bony anatomy  is relevant  to treatment  planning.  Other  procedures including  
bone  scan,  SPECT or SPECT/CT of the whole  spine,  and FDG-PET/CT may be appropriate  in cases in which 
there are multiple  fractures or concern  for more  widespread  distribution  of fractures.  
• Variant  3: In the setting  of new back  pain and either  previously treated  VCF  or multiple  VCFs,  either  CT or 
MRI of the spine  without  IV contrast  is recommended  as the initial imaging  study.  MRI of the spine  with and 
without  IV contrast  may be useful  to assess for inflammation  but should be carefully  assessed  because it is

Bone  Scan  Whole  Body  with  SPECT  or SPECT/CT  Complete Spine

suggests possible  utility  of bone  scan with SPECT or SPECT/CT as a functional  modality  to localize the source of 
LBP, particularly  for facet  arthropathy [28-30]. A prospective study  of 99 patients  with LBP evaluated  with 
SPECT/CT demonstrated  >40%  of scintigraphically  active facet  joints  did not correlate to degree of facet  joint 
degeneration  on CT, using  standardized  grading  scales [29]. A randomized  double -blinded  controlled  study  of 80 
patients  showed  >50%  pain relief  in patients  who received  diagnostic  facet  or sacroiliac joint anesthetic blocks  
based  on clinical  and SPECT/CT findings  compared  with those  who received  blocks  based  on clinical  and

There is no role for bone scintigraphy in assessment of Bankart or Hill -Sachs lesions.  
Variant 6: Traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs normal.  Physical examination and history consistent 
with dislocation event  or instability . Next imaging study. 
Shoulder dislocation or instability is most co mmon in the anterior direction. Younger patients are more likely to 
have labroligamentous injury and persistent instability after dislocation compared with older patients [54]. Older 
patients are more likely to have rotator cuff tears in association with shoulder dislocation [ 55]. Coexisting 
humeral avulsion of the glenohumeral ligament and significant glenoid bone loss have been found in up to 10% of 
patients with recurrent shoulder instability [ 56], which underscores the need to assess both osseous and 
labroligamentous pathology in patients with shoulder dislocation or instability. Glenoid morphology and bone 
loss can play a significant factor in recurrent shoulder dislocations [15, 16,57], which may require bone grafting in 
order to restore stability [ 57].

• Variant 6 : US or Image-guided anesthetic +/ - corticosteroid injection or MR arthrography or MRI without IV 
contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study in the evaluation of chronic shoulder pain when 
radiographs are normal or inconclusive  and biceps tendon abnormality is suspected.  These procedures are

Page Content: MR arthrography has been shown 
to be equivalent to CT in the assess ment of glenoid and humeral head bone loss [ 12,18], while being superior to 
CT in assessment of labroligamentous in juries [12]. MR arthrography is also able to delineate humeral head and 
glenoid cartilage, which can be important because some Hill -Sachs lesions affect  cartilage only  [11]. 
CT Shoulder  
Noncontrast CT has historically been used to assess Hill -Sachs and bony Bankart lesions. However, MRI has 
been shown to be equivalent to CT for a ssessing both glenoid and humeral head bone loss [ 12,18,53], and CT is 
limited in the assessment of cartilaginous Hill -Sachs lesions [11]. In addition, CT cannot assess injury to 
soft-tissue structures like the labroligamentous complex, which further limits its usefulness in evaluating Bankart 
lesions. CT should be reserved for patients with a contraindication to MRI or patients in whom MRI assessment 
of bone loss is limited.  
CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
CT arthrography has sho wn fair agreement between observers and is comparable to MR arthrography in 
diagnosing Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions [ 12,13]. However, CT arthrography is inferior to MRI in diagnosing 
other soft -tissue pathology [ 12]. CT arthrography can be considered a reasonable imaging alterna tive in patients 
with contraindication to MRI. 
US Shoulder  
There is no role for US  in assessment of Bankart or Hill -Sachs lesions. US  has been demonstrated to be inferior to

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 11 Shoulder Pain –Traumatic  Variant 5: Traumatic shoulder pain. Radiographs show Bankart  or Hill-Sachs lesion. Next imaging  study. 
Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions are common findings associated with transient shoulder dislocation. Bankart 
lesions have a particularly high association with transient shoulder dislocations [50], and a transient shoulder 
dislocation should be presumed if a Bankart lesion is present. A close association exists bet ween Bankart and 
Hill-Sachs lesions [ 51], and one should be sought out whenever the other is identified on radiographs. Both 
Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions can present as nonosseous  lesions that are occult on r adiographs and noncontrast 
CT. 
MRI Shoulder  
Similar to MR arthrography, noncontrast MRI is comparable to CT in evaluating glenoid and humeral head bone 
loss [12,18]. In general, noncontrast MRI performs well in diagnosing labroligamentous injuries [ 20,52]. 
However, noncontrast MRI is considered inferior to MR arthrography for assessing labroligamentous pathology 
frequently associated with Bankart and Hill -Sachs lesions [ 17,19]. Noncontrast MRI is a good alternative to MR 
arthrography in the setting of acute injury when significant glenohumeral joint effusion is present to assist in 
visualization of intra -articular soft -tissue pathology.  
MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography is the preferred study for evaluating subacute or chronic Bankart lesions because of  its soft -
tissue contrast. Multiple studies have shown MR arthrography to be reliable in diagnosing labroligamentous 
injuries [12,17,52] and superior to noncontrast MRI for this indication [ 17,19].",False

CT is considered inferior to MRI for diagnosing essentially all soft -tissue shoulder  injuries. 
CT Arthrography  Shoulder  
CT arthrogram , althou gh not the initial study of choice, has the advantage of characterizing both bony lesions and 
significant soft -tissue injuries. CT arthrograms have been shown to be comparable to magnetic resonance ( MR) 
arthrography in diagnosing Bankart, Hill -Sachs, super ior labral anterior -to-posterior ( SLAP), and full-thickness 
rotator cuff tears, but inferior to MR arthrography for diagnosing partial -thickness rotator cuff tears [ 12], 
including bursal -sided tears. CT arthrography has also only demonstrated modest agreement between observers in 
diagnosing anterior capsular laxity of the shoulder [ 13]. 
MRI Shoulder  
Noncontrast MR imaging ( MRI) has been shown to be effective in assessing bony morphology and bone loss in 
patients with tr aumatic shoulder injuries [ 14-18 ], and noncontrast MRI is effective in diagnosing most traumatic 
soft-tissue pathologies including labral, rotator cuff, and glenohumeral ligament injuries [ 17,19,20]. 
MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography is considered the gold standard for imaging traumatic shoulder pain [4,17,19,21]. MR 
arthrography is comparable to noncontrast MRI in assessment of extra -articular soft tissues, and MR arthrography 
has been shown to be superior to noncontrast MRI i n diagnosing intra -articular pathology like SLAP tears, 
labroligamentous injuries, and partial rotator cuff tears [17,19]. MR arthrography is comparable to CT in

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 12 Shoulder Pain –Traumatic  MR Arthrography  Shoulder  
MR arthrography is the preferred exam ination  for the evaluation of subacute shoulder dislocations or recurrent 
shoulder instability. MRI has been shown to have similar performance to CT in the evaluation of Hill-Sachs 
lesions and glenoid bone loss [12,18]. MR arthrography has also been found to be reliable in diagnosi ng anterior 
shoulder instability and labroligamentous injuries [58,59]. MR arthrography has specifically o utperformed 
noncontrast MRI in assessment of glenohumeral ligament and anterior labral injuries [ 17,19], which ar e 
commonly seen in shoulder instability. MR arthrogr aphy has also outperformed noncontrast MRI in diagnosis of 
rotator cuff tears [17,19], which is a common associated finding in older patients with shoulder dislocation. 
However, high sensitivities reported for MR arthrography in the detection of labral pathology may not be 
applicable to patients with clinically unstable shoulders. A retrospective review of 90 patients with clinically 
unstable shoulders selected for arthroscopy [ 60] found that MR arthrography had a sensitivity of 65% for 
detection of labral  tears. The authors proposed that this discrepancy with prior studies was the result of different 
patient selection criteria (clinically unstable in their study versus less-specific symptoms such as shoulder pain in 
others) and the interpretation of MR art hrography by experienced musculoskeletal radiologists [ 60]. For this 
document, it is assumed the procedure is performed and interpreted by an expert.  
MRI Shoulder  
MRI without contrast may be pre ferred to MR arthrography in the setting of acute shoulder dislocation when a 
post-traumatic joint effusion is present to provide sufficient visualization of soft -tissue structures. In the subacute 
or chronic setting, the glenohumeral joint effusion is usually too small to provide adequate joint distention for

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 6 Acute Hand and Wrist Trauma  Like CT, MRI shows intra -articular extension of distal radius fractures more frequently than radiography.  Unlike 
CT, MRI shows concomitant ligament  injuries, including tears of the scapholunate ligament, which may affect 
surgical treatment [26,27]. Despite these advantages,  MRI performed immediately at the time of injury has little 
added value for determining which patients go on to surgery [ 23]. 
MRI is especially useful in evaluating  hand soft -tissues injuries, including the collateral ligaments, volar plates, 
tendons, and pulleys. For metacarpal and digital fractures, MRI is usually not indicated during acute injury [ 22]. 
There is no evidence to support the use of MRI with IV contrast in the setting of acute hand and wrist trauma.  
US Area of Interest  
US may have a limited utility  for evaluating bone injuries. Christiansen et al  [28] reported 47% sensitivity and 
61% specificity of US  for the detection of scaphoid fractures . They concluded that US  is not suitable for the early 
diagnosis of scaphoid fracture.  In contrast, Hauger et al  [29] reported that using cortical disruption as a diagnostic 
criterion on US is an accurate sign for detecting occult fractures of the scaphoid waist. Further study of US  for the 
diagnosis of occult fractures is needed . 
Bone Scan Area of  Interest

Radiography Wrist  
Assessment of carpal instability with conventional radiographs requires careful attention to radiographic 
positioning.  In low -grade injuries, radiographs are usually normal.  Scapholunate diastasis of >4 mm and dorsal til t 
of the lunate of > 10° suggests dorsal intercalated segmental instability  [30,31].

MRI is ideal for evaluating tendon injuries and helping with surgical planning [58, 59]. MRI is comm only used for 
the diagnosis of  Stener lesions of the thumb [60] and the diagnosis of pulley system injuries [61]. 
Hergan et al [62] reported a 100% sensitivity and specificity for assessment of thumb ulnar collateral ligament 
tears. Spaeth et al [ 63] reported a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 94% for detection of displaced ulnar 
collateral ligament tears in 16 cadaveric specimens.  
US Hand  
A Stener lesion occurs when the aponeurosis of the adductor pollicis muscle becomes interposed between the 
ruptured ulnar collateral ligament of the thumb and its site  of insertion at the base of the proximal phalanx. This 
lesion can be identified by absence of ulnar collateral ligament and the presence of a hypoechoic mass proximal to 
the apex of the metacarpal tubercle [64]. Dynamic examination shows the relationship of the aponeurosis to the 
retracted ligament stump [65] . 
US allows for diagnosis of pulley system injuries [ 66,67]. 
Bone Scan Hand 
Bone scan is not indicated in this clinical setting.  
Variant 6: Initial radiographs showing metaca rpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, or distal 
interphalangeal joint malalignment in the absence of fracture. Next imaging study.  
CT Hand  
CT has limited use for the diagnosis of soft -tissue injuries of the fingers.  
MRI Hand  
MRI is ideal for evaluating tendon injuries and helping with surgical planning [58]. MRI may be used to assess 
capsule and collateral ligament injuries of the proximal interphalangeal  and metacarpophalangeal joints [68]. 
For flexor tendon injuries, Rubin et al [ 69] reported a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of  100% in cadavers.

comparable [38]. 
The accuracy of MRI for extrinsic ligament assessment is unknown [ 37]. 
Extensor carpi ulnaris tendinopathy, tenosynovitis, and tendon rupture can be evaluated with MRI or US [43]. 
However, dynamic instability may be missed on MRI, unless sequences are performed in pronation and 
supination [44]. 
MR Arthrography  Wrist  
At 1.5T, MR arthrography has greater sensitivity compared with conventional MRI [ 45,46]. Both MRI and MR 
arthrography have poor to moderate sensitivity for partial ligament tears [ 47,48]. When only complete tears are 
considered, MRI and MR arthrography may be equivalent [ 33]. 
The accuracy of  MR arthrography for extrinsic ligament assessment is unknown [ 37]. 
US Wrist  
High -frequency US is useful for visualizing wrist tendons as well as intrinsic and extrinsic carpal ligaments 
[44,49,50]. Dynamic “clenched fist” maneuvers may be performed to improve detection of low -grade injuries 
[51]. 
For tears of the dorsal band of the scapholunate ligament, US  sensitivity varies from 46 % to 100% and specificity 
from 92 % to 100% [50-52 ]. For the dorsal band of the lunotriquetral ligament, US  sensitivity ranges from 25 % to 
50% and specificity from 90% to 100% [52,53]. US visualization of lunotriquetral ligament (particularly the 
structurally important volar band) is limited [ 49]. 
US can show dynamic subluxation of the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon during forced supination [ 44].

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 8 Chronic Foot Pain  MRI Foot  
MRI allows the visualization of bone marrow edema patterns, which improve s the detection of fractures in cases of 
negative or inconclusive radiographs [70] . The utility of MRI in the detection of radiographically occult Chopart 
fractures has been demonstrated by Almeida et al [64] . Baker et al [71]  analyzed 31 occult fractures involving the 
ankle and foot in h ockey players,  finding five occult fractures in the foot, all of which involved the navicular bone. 
Pierre -Jerome et al [72] found 79% of cuboid fractures in the diabetic population that were radiographically occult 
using MRI. MRI is also useful in the detection of occult fractures involving the fifth metatarsal bone (Jones fracture) 
and the subtalar join t [65,73] . There is no evidence in the literature supporting the routine use of contrast in the 
diagnosi s of occult fractures.  
MRI has replaced bone scans in the evaluation of symptomatic accessory ossicles. MRI allows optimal visualization 
of the bone marrow within the ossicle and visualization of the synchondrosis. Accessory ossicles may also be 
associated  with tendon pathology, which is also well assessed on MRI [74]. MRI allows clear demonstration of the 
findings often associated with posterior ankle impingement syndrome [75]. Contrast administration is not routinely 
performed when assessing symptomatic accessory ossicles on MRI; however, contrast within a disrupted 
synchondrosis may be demonstrated on MR arthrography stu dies [69]. 
US Foot   
Although not routinely performed, previous studies have demonstrated the role of US in the detection of occult foot 
fractures. On US, these can be seen as cortical irregularities and are frequently associated with soft -tissue injury in 
the acute or subacute setting. Wang et al [76]  demonstrated 24 cases of radiographically occult ankle and foot 
fractures in 268 patients. Of these, foot fractures were found most frequently in the calcaneus and metatarsals, and 
less frequently in the navicular, cuboid , and cuneiform bones.

not radiopaque  (eg, wood  or plastic) , with a reported  90% sensitivity  for visualizing  wooden  foreign  bodies  in 
some  clinical  and experimental  studies [27,28] . US can identify  a foreign  body  and also help localize  it and 
determine if it involves  a tendon  or a muscle and to evaluate for an abscess.

In clinical  situations  when  Ottawa rules  are applicable and negative , imaging may still be desired  to evaluate for 
injuries  not assessed  by the Ottawa rules.  For example,  clinical scenarios of acute foot trauma  not directly  
addressed  by the Ottawa rules include  trauma  to the metatarsal  heads  and toes and acute tendon injury.

Radiography Foot  
Conventional radiography can be useful to distinguish among different causes of chronic foot pain and is usually 
the first imag ing study in evaluating patients with chronic foot pain.  
The value of radiographs in the diagnosis of tarsal coalitions has been extensively demonstrated. Overall 
sensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs 
in the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral 
and oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar 
coalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs 
on the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have 
been found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable 
methods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  
Radiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review 
by Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for 
radiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.",True
