Superior imaging procedures or treatments:\nMRI of the hands with and without IV contrast is a comprehensive imaging modality that can provide detailed information about the soft tissues, bones, and joints. However, considering the patient's symptoms and the findings from the X-ray, a non-contrast MRI might be sufficient to assess the extent of osteoarthritis and any associated soft tissue changes. The use of IV contrast may not significantly add to the diagnostic value in this case, but it does increase the risk of potential side effects and allergic reactions.\n\n3. Appropriateness of the scan order:\nBased on the scoring criteria, the scan order of an MRI of bilateral hands with and without IV contrast may be appropriate. However, considering the risk-benefit ratio, a non-contrast MRI might be a more suitable choice. Therefore, the scan order as it stands is MAY BE APPROPRIATE.
