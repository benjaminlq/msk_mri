2. Superior imaging procedures or treatments:
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of osteoarthritis, which is a clinical diagnosis and can be confirmed with plain radiographs. The patient has already had X-rays which show degenerative changes. An MRI with and without contrast is not typically necessary for the diagnosis or management of osteoarthritis unless there are atypical features or the diagnosis is uncertain. 

3. Based on the scoring criteria:
The scan order of an MRI of bilateral hands with and without IV contrast is USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE. The patient's symptoms and findings are consistent with osteoarthritis, which can be diagnosed and managed without the need for an MRI. Instead, the patient should be managed with conservative measures such as pain management, physical therapy, and lifestyle modifications. If these measures are not effective, then further imaging or interventions may be considered.",USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE,Plain radiographs (X-rays) for confirmation of osteoarthritis diagnosis.,FALSE

   - Stage of Diagnosis: Next study, as X-rays have already been performed and showed no significant abnormality

2. An MRI of the feet without IV contrast is a good imaging procedure to assess for plantar fasciitis, especially when the X-ray shows no significant abnormality. It can provide detailed images of the soft tissues, including the plantar fascia, and can help identify inflammation or thickening that might suggest plantar fasciitis. However, it's worth noting that plantar fasciitis is often a clinical diagnosis and imaging is not always necessary unless the patient is not responding to conservative treatment.

3. Based on the scoring criteria, the scan order of an MRI bilateral feet without IV contrast to assess for plantar fasciitis is USUALLY APPROPRIATE. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of plantar fasciitis, and the MRI can help confirm the diagnosis and rule out other causes of heel pain.

   - Previous Diagnosis: Mild bilateral knee degeneration seen on X-rays
   - Stage of Diagnosis: Next study, as X-rays have already been performed

2. The ordered scan is an MRI of the bilateral knees with and without IV contrast. This is a comprehensive imaging modality that can provide detailed information about the soft tissues, cartilage, and bone marrow. However, considering the patient's age, symptoms, and the fact that degenerative changes have already been identified on X-ray, the use of IV contrast may not be necessary. Contrast is typically used to better visualize inflammation, infection, or tumors, which do not seem to be the primary concern here. An MRI without contrast would likely be sufficient to assess the extent of the degenerative changes and any potential soft tissue injuries that could be contributing to the patient's symptoms.

3. Based on the scoring criteria, the scan order of an MRI of the bilateral knees with and without IV contrast is MAY BE APPROPRIATE. The MRI is a suitable next step for further evaluation of the patient's symptoms and the degenerative changes seen on X-ray.

2. Superior imaging procedures or treatments:
In this case, the patient has already had an X-ray which has shown degeneration and effusions. An MRI can provide more detailed images of the soft tissues, including the cartilage, tendons, and ligaments, which can be useful in assessing the extent of degeneration. However, considering the patient's age and the fact that he is already symptomatic, the management would likely be more focused on symptom control rather than further imaging. Non-surgical treatments such as physical therapy, weight management, and pain management with medications could be considered. If these measures fail, surgical options like knee replacement could be considered.

3. Based on the scoring criteria, the scan order of an MRI of the bilateral knees without IV contrast to assess the extent of degeneration is MAY BE APPROPRIATE. While it can provide more detailed information about the extent of degeneration, it may not significantly change the management plan, which would likely be focused on symptom control given the patient's age and symptomatic status.",MAY BE APPROPRIATE,MRI without IV contrast,TRUE

- Stage of Diagnosis: Next study, as X-rays have already been performed.

2. Superior imaging procedures or treatments:
MRI arthrography is a highly sensitive and specific imaging modality for evaluating shoulder joint pathology. However, it is an invasive procedure as it involves the injection of contrast material into the joint. In this case, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder), which is a clinical diagnosis and can often be made based on history and physical examination alone. Imaging is typically not necessary unless the diagnosis is unclear or if there is suspicion of other shoulder pathology.
