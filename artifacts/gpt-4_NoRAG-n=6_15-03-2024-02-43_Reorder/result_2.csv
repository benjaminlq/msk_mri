   - Stage of diagnosis: Initial imaging, as no prior imaging has been done

2. The ordered scan is an MRI lumbar spine without IV contrast. This is a non-invasive imaging technique that provides detailed images of the soft tissues, bones, and nerves in the lumbar spine. It is a good choice for initial imaging in this case, as it can help identify a range of conditions that could be causing the patient's low back pain, such as disc herniation, spinal stenosis, or tumors. However, considering the patient's age and the absence of red flag symptoms such as severe or progressive neurological deficits, or suspicion of systemic disease or infection, a more conservative approach with pain management and physical therapy could be considered before resorting to imaging.

3. Based on the scoring criteria, the scan order of MRI lumbar spine without IV contrast is MAY BE APPROPRIATE. It can provide valuable information about the cause of the patient's low back pain, but given the absence of red flag symptoms, a trial of conservative management may be a more favorable risk-benefit ratio initially.
