2. The ordered scan is an MRI of the right forefoot with and without IV contrast for evaluation of gout. While MRI can be used to evaluate gout, it is not typically the first-line imaging study. Dual-energy CT (DECT) is more sensitive and specific for detecting monosodium urate crystals, the cause of gout. Additionally, plain radiographs (X-rays) of the foot can be used to evaluate for joint damage and tophi, which are common in chronic gout. 

3. Based on the scoring criteria, the ordered scan is USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE. The patient's symptoms and history suggest gout, but MRI is not the most effective or efficient imaging study for this condition. A more appropriate initial imaging study would be a plain radiograph (X-ray) of the right foot. If further evaluation is needed, a DECT could be considered.",USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE,Plain radiograph (X-ray) of the right foot,TRUE

- Previous Diagnosis: X-rays show degenerative changes in bilateral hand interphalangeal joints with equivocal gull-wing deformity
- Stage of Diagnosis: Next study, as X-rays have already been performed

2. Superior imaging procedures or treatments:
MRI of the hands with and without IV contrast is a comprehensive imaging study that can provide detailed information about the soft tissues, bones, and joints. However, considering the patient's symptoms and the findings on the X-ray, a non-contrast MRI might be sufficient to assess for erosive osteoarthritis. The use of IV contrast may not significantly add to the diagnostic value in this case but may increase the risk of side effects and complications related to the contrast material.

3. Based on the scoring criteria:
The scan order of MRI of bilateral hands with and without IV contrast MAY BE APPROPRIATE. It can provide detailed information about the condition of the patient's joints. However, considering the risk-benefit ratio, a non-contrast MRI might be a more appropriate choice in this case.",MAY BE APPROPRIATE,Non-contrast MRI,TRUE

   - Previous diagnosis: Endometrial cancer 20 years ago (treated with total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophrectomy)
   - Physical activity: Does a lot of brisk walking
   - Physical examination: Tenderness over metatarsal head/neck regions
   - Stage of diagnosis: Initial imaging

2. An MRI of the foot without IV contrast is a good choice for assessing for stress fractures or injuries, especially in a patient with chronic foot pain that worsens with exercise. However, considering the patient's age and the chronicity of the symptoms, an initial X-ray of the foot might be a more appropriate first step. X-rays are less expensive, more readily available, and expose the patient to less risk than an MRI. They can often detect stress fractures, although they may not be visible in the early stages of the injury.

3. Based on the scoring criteria, the scan order of an MRI right foot without IV contrast is MAY BE APPROPRIATE. It could provide valuable information about the patient's condition, but an X-ray might be a more suitable initial imaging study due to its lower cost and risk. If the X-ray does not provide a clear diagnosis and the patient's symptoms persist, an MRI could then be considered.",MAY BE APPROPRIATE,X-ray of the foot as the most appropriate imaging modality.,FALSE

- Previous diagnosis: Fibroids, endometriosis, gestational diabetes, bilateral breast fibroadenomas
- Previous imaging: X-rays show no significant abnormality, in particular no plantar calcaneal spur
- Stage of diagnosis: Next study, as X-rays have already been performed

2. Superior imaging procedures or treatments:
MRI is a sensitive and specific imaging modality for the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis. It can show thickening of the plantar fascia, edema, and other signs of inflammation. However, it is usually reserved for cases where the diagnosis is unclear or conservative treatment has failed. In this case, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with plantar fasciitis, and there are no findings on X-ray to suggest another diagnosis. Therefore, an MRI may not be necessary at this stage. Conservative treatment, including rest, ice, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and physical therapy, is usually the first line of treatment for plantar fasciitis.

3. Based on the scoring criteria, the scan order of MRI bilateral feet without IV contrast to assess for plantar fasciitis is MAY BE APPROPRIATE. While the MRI can provide detailed information about the plantar fascia, it may not be necessary given the patient's clinical presentation and the lack of findings on X-ray to suggest another diagnosis. Conservative treatment should be considered first. If the patient's symptoms do not improve with conservative treatment, then an MRI may be appropriate to further evaluate the plantar fascia.",MAY BE APPROPRIATE,MRI,FALSE

   - Previous Diagnosis: Mild degenerative changes in the wrist seen on X-rays
   - Stage of Diagnosis: Next study, as X-rays have already been performed
   - Physical Examination: Positive fovea sign, pain elicited on ulnar deviation of wrist

2. The ordered scan is an MRI arthrography of the right wrist. This is a specialized type of MRI where a contrast material is injected into the wrist joint and images are taken to reveal details about the internal structure of the wrist. It is particularly useful for diagnosing injuries to the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), which is suspected in this patient due to the positive fovea sign and pain on ulnar deviation. 

3. Based on the scoring criteria, the scan order is USUALLY APPROPRIATE. The patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and previous X-ray results all point towards a possible TFCC injury, which is best evaluated with an MRI arthrography. This procedure has a favorable risk-benefit ratio in this scenario, as it can provide detailed information about the wrist's internal structure and help guide further treatment.",USUALLY APPROPRIATE,MRI arthrography,FALSE

   - Age: 30 years old
   - Symptoms: Painful swelling of left wrist for about 1 year, with mild skin discharge. Dorsal wrist swelling with skin sinus tracts and yellowish-cheesy discharge. No tenderness.
   - Previous Diagnosis: None mentioned, but X-rays show no gross destructive bone lesion.
   - Stage of Diagnosis: Initial imaging has been done (X-ray), this would be a next study.
   - Other relevant information: Long term volunteer in African community hospital, which may increase exposure to certain diseases such as TB.

2. MRI arthrography is a good choice for assessing soft tissue structures and can help in diagnosing TB tenosynovitis. However, it is an invasive procedure as it involves the injection of a contrast material into the joint. An MRI without contrast could be a less invasive alternative, but it may not provide as detailed information about the joint structures. Another alternative could be an ultrasound, which is non-invasive and can also provide information about soft tissue structures. However, it may not be as sensitive or specific as an MRI.

3. Based on the scoring criteria, the scan order of MRI arthrography of the left wrist to assess for TB tenosynovitis is USUALLY APPROPRIATE. The patient's symptoms and history of volunteering in an African community hospital suggest a higher risk of TB, making the need for a detailed assessment of the joint structures important. The risk-benefit ratio is favorable as the potential benefits of diagnosing and treating TB tenosynovitis outweigh the risks associated with the procedure.

   - Symptoms: Chronic bilateral hip pain, worse on the right, sometimes with locking sensation. Pain on internal rotation, adduction, and extension of bilateral hips.
   - Previous Diagnosis: None mentioned
   - Stage of Diagnosis: Initial imaging

2. The ordered scan is an MRI of the bilateral hips without IV contrast. This is a good choice for initial imaging in this case as it can provide detailed images of the hip joint, including the labrum, and can help identify any tears or other abnormalities. It does not expose the patient to radiation, which is a benefit over other imaging modalities like CT. However, an X-ray could be considered as a first-line imaging study to assess for any bony abnormalities or osteoarthritis, which are common causes of hip pain in this age group.

3. Based on the scoring criteria, the ordered scan (MRI bilateral hips without IV contrast) is USUALLY APPROPRIATE. It is a suitable choice for the initial imaging of a patient with these symptoms and can help identify the cause of the patient's hip pain.

   - Initial Imaging: X-rays show no significant abnormality
   - Stage of Diagnosis: Next study, as initial imaging (X-ray) has been done

2. In this case, an MRI without contrast could be a superior imaging procedure. Trochanteric bursitis is an inflammation of the bursa located at the outer point of the hip, known as the greater trochanter. This condition can often be diagnosed based on clinical symptoms and physical examination, and confirmed with imaging studies. While MRI with contrast can provide more detailed images, it also carries a risk of allergic reactions and kidney damage. An MRI without contrast can still provide detailed images of the soft tissues, including the bursa, and can help confirm the diagnosis of trochanteric bursitis without the risks associated with contrast.

3. Based on the scoring criteria, the scan order of an MRI left hip with and without IV contrast may be appropriate. However, considering the patient's age, symptoms, and the risks associated with contrast, an MRI without contrast could be a more appropriate choice. Therefore, the scan order is MAY BE APPROPRIATE.

There is no mention of symptoms, previous diagnosis, or stage of diagnosis.

2. Ankylosing spondylitis is a type of arthritis that affects the spine. The most common imaging modality for ankylosing spondylitis is X-ray, which can show changes in the spine and sacroiliac joints. MRI is also used, especially in early disease, to detect inflammation and changes in the spine and sacroiliac joints. The use of IV contrast can help to highlight areas of inflammation and active disease. However, it's important to note that the diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis is typically based on clinical findings and the presence of the HLA-B27 gene, not solely on imaging findings.

3. Based on the scoring criteria, the scan order of an MRI lumbosacral spine without and with IV contrast may be appropriate for this patient.
