Radiographs normal or nonspecific. Suspect carpal tunnel syndrome.  Next \nstudy. \nUS Wrist \nSeveral meta- analyses have confirmed that the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (typically measured at the \ncarpal  tunnel  inlet) is highly accurate for identifying carpal  tunnel syndrome  diagnosed clinically or with the \ncombination of clinical and  electrophysiologic studies  [21,22,24]. The expected sensitivity and specificity of US \nvaries depending on what cut -off values are chosen for the size of the nerve and where in the carpal tunnel the \nmeasurements are made [ 24,61-64]. There is strong evidence that US can be a replacement or compl ementary \nexamination to nerve conduction studies and electromyography in patients with clinically suspected carpal tunnel \nsyndrome  [21-23]. There is also some evidence that the presence of vessels or hypervascularity within the carpal \ntunnel, demonstrated with power Doppler US, is another feature of carpal tunnel syndrome [65 ,66]. Nevertheless, \nclinical examination combined with electrophysiolog ic testing remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of \ncarpal tunnel syndrome. US may be appropriate in cases where this initial evaluation is equivocal.  \nMRI Wrist  \nHistorically, carpal tunnel syndrome has been diagnosed based on clinical signs and sympt oms and confirmed by \nthe results of electrodiagnostic studies [67].

MR arthrogr aphy has also outperformed noncontrast MRI in diagnosis of \nrotator cuff tears [17,19], which is a common associated finding in older patients with shoulder dislocation. \nHowever, high sensitivities reported for MR arthrography in the detection of labral pathology may not be \napplicable to patients with clinically unstable shoulders. A retrospective review of 90 patients with clinically \nunstable shoulders selected for arthroscopy [ 60] found that MR arthrography had a sensitivity of 65% for \ndetection of labral  tears. The authors proposed that this discrepancy with prior studies was the result of different \npatient selection criteria (clinically unstable in their study versus less-specific symptoms such as shoulder pain in \nothers) and the interpretation of MR art hrography by experienced musculoskeletal radiologists [ 60]. For this \ndocument, it is assumed the procedure is performed and interpreted by an expert.  \nMRI Shoulder  \nMRI without contrast may be pre ferred to MR arthrography in the setting of acute shoulder dislocation when a \npost-traumatic joint effusion is present to provide sufficient visualization of soft -tissue structures.", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "ACR shoulder pain traumatic.pdf"}, "score": 0.886914585973282}, {"page_content": "Next  imaging  study.  \nProcedure  Appropriateness  Category  Relative  Radiation  Level  \nMR arthrography shoulder  Usually Appropriate  O \nMRI shoulder without IV contrast  Usually Appropriate  O \nCT shoulder without IV contrast  May Be Appropriate  \u2622\u2622\u2622 \nCT arthrography shoulder  May Be Appropriate  \u2622\u2622\u2622\u2622 \nUS shoulder  Usually Not Appropriate  O \nRadiography shoulder additional views  Usually Not Appropriate  \u2622 \nImage -guided anesthetic +/ - corticosteroid \ninjection shoulder or surrounding structures  Usually Not Appropriate  Varies  \nMRI shoulder without and with IV contrast  Usually Not Appropriate  O \nBone  scan shoulder  Usually Not Appropriate  \u2622\u2622\u2622 \nCT shoulder  with IV contrast  Usually Not Appropriate  \u2622\u2622\u2622 \nCT shoulder  without  and with IV contrast  Usually Not Appropriate  \u2622\u2622\u2622 \nFDG -PET/CT  skull  base to mid-thigh  Usually Not Appropriate  \u2622\u2622\u2622\u2622", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "ACR chronic shoulder pain.pdf"}, "score": 0.880846417259146}, {"page_content": "Initial imaging.  \nProcedure  Appropriateness  Category  Relative  Radiation  Level  \nRadiography shoulder  Usually Appropriate  \u2622 \nUS shoulder  Usually Not Appropriate  O \nMRI shoulder without and with IV contrast  Usually Not Appropriate  O \nMRI shoulder without IV contrast  Usually Not Appropriate  O \n3-phase  bone  scan with SPECT  or SPECT/CT  \nshoulder   Usually Not Appropriate  \u2622\u2622\u2622 \nBone  scan shoulder  Usually Not Appropriate  \u2622\u2622\u2622 \nCT shoulder  with IV contrast  Usually Not Appropriate  \u2622\u2622\u2622 \nCT shoulder  without  and with IV contrast  Usually Not Appropriate  \u2622\u2622\u2622 \nCT shoulder  without  IV contrast  Usually Not Appropriate  \u2622\u2622\u2622 \nFluoride  PET/CT skull base to mid-thigh  Usually Not Appropriate  \u2622\u2622\u2622", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "ACR imaging after shoulder arthroplasty.pdf"}, "score": 0.8803078728630205}], "appropriateness": "USUALLY APPROPRIATE", "recommendation": "MRI arthrography shoulder"}, {"question": "Case: 28 year old Bangladeshi male.\nScan Ordered: MRI left wrist for ?tendon injury.\nQuestion: Is this imaging modality for this case USUALLY APPROPRIATE, MAY BE APPROPRIATE, USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE or INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION.
