2. Explanation: The patient's profile indicates traumatic shoulder pain with a history of a rugby tackle, physical examination findings consistent with shoulder instability, and normal radiographs. According to the ACR Appropriateness Criteria® for traumatic shoulder pain with physical examination and history consistent with dislocation event or instability (Variant 6), an MRI shoulder without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study. This imaging modality can help assess for labroligamentous injury and any associated pathology, which is common in younger patients like the one in the profile.

Shoulder dislocation or instability is most co mmon in the anterior direction. Younger patients are more likely to 
have labroligamentous injury and persistent instability after dislocation compared with older patients [54]. Older 
patients are more likely to have rotator cuff tears in association with shoulder dislocation [ 55]. Coexisting 
humeral avulsion of the glenohumeral ligament and significant glenoid bone loss have been found in up to 10% of 
patients with recurrent shoulder instability [ 56], which underscores the need to assess both osseous and 
labroligamentous pathology in patients with shoulder dislocation or instability. Glenoid morphology and bone 
loss can play a significant factor in recurrent shoulder dislocations [15, 16,57], which may require bone grafting in 
order to restore stability [ 57].

Appropriately positioned  radiographs can exclude shoulder dislocation and most displaced fractures as the 
etiology for post -traumatic shoulder pain. In the setting of normal shoulder radiographs, the most common causes 
of post -traumatic shoulder pain are soft -tissue injuries such  as rotator cuff and labral tears.  
MRI Shoulder  
Noncontrast MRI is a reasonable imaging study in the setting of acute nonlocalized traumatic shoulder pain and 
noncontributory radiographs. In the acute trauma setting, noncontrast MRI may be preferred to MR arthrography , 
as acute intra-articular pathology will typically produce significant joint effusion for assessment of intra -articular 
soft-tissue structures. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in assessing extra-articular soft -tissue traumatic

- Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 6 Acute Hand and Wrist Trauma  Like CT, MRI shows intra -articular extension of distal radius fractures more frequently than radiography.  Unlike 
CT, MRI shows concomitant ligament  injuries, including tears of the scapholunate ligament, which may affect 
surgical treatment [26,27]. Despite these advantages,  MRI performed immediately at the time of injury has little 
added value for determining which patients go on to surgery [ 23].

Radiography Hip 
The literature  indicates that radiography  is a first-line screening  tool, and hip radiographs  are useful  in the initial 
imaging  workup of chronic  hip pain [12]. Oftentimes  a pelvic radiograph,  which  includes  imaging  of both hips,  
may be obtained concurrently with additional  dedicated  collimated  radiograph(s)  of the affected  hip(s). Findings  on 
hip radiographs  can result  in an imaging  diagnosis  such as osteoarthritis  or can lead to more  advanced  workups  of 
less common causes of chronic  hip pain such as primary  bone  tumors.  The results of screening  hip radiographs  can 
help guide  the use of additional  imaging  studies such as more  specialized  radiographic  views  or more  advanced  
modalities  such as CT, ultrasound (US), MRI,  radionuclide  bone  scans,  and fluoride  PET [13-15].

Special Imaging  Considerations  
Knee radiographs  should include at least one frontal projection of one or both knees (anteroposterior, Rosenberg, 
or tunnel), a tangential patellar view , and a lateral view of the affected knee [2,9]. Standing radiographs more 
accurately reflect medial and lateral compartment cartilage loss than supine radiographs with the posteromedial and posterolateral joint compartments  more accurately assessed using a weight -bearing flexion posteroanterior 
radiograph [9,10].

2. Explanation: The patient is a professional tennis player with a history of right elbow pain that has been worsening over the past month. The pain is worse during tennis and is affecting his grip on the racquet. Physical examination reveals tenderness at the lateral epicondyle, which is a common symptom of lateral epicondylitis, also known as ""tennis elbow"". X-rays show no fracture, dislocation, or elbow effusion. Given these findings, an MRI without and with IV contrast is usually appropriate to evaluate for lateral epicondylitis. MRI has high inter- and intraobserver reliability for the diagnosis of epicondylalgia and can also demonstrate associated findings in epicondylalgia, including radial collateral and lateral UCL injuries. This can facilitate surgical planning if necessary.

• Variant 1 : Radiography elbow  is usually appropriate for the initial imaging of  chronic elbow pain.  
• Variant 2 : In the setting of chronic elbow pain with mechanical symptoms such as locking, clicking, or limited 
range of motion with normal or nonspecific radiographs, MR arthrography elbow or MRI elbow without IV

- Page Content: initial evaluation is equivocal. The MRI findings that have been reported in wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome —
including nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing—may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value 
in patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68]. In rare cases of secondary carpal tunnel syndrome, MRI may identify 
a mass lesion compressing the median nerve. There is some evidence that the length of T2 hyperintensity in the 
median nerve can help prognosticate the success of surgery [69] and that the shape and signal of the nerve predict 
clinical response to a steroid injection in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome [70 ]. MR neurography 
may be an option in patients with suspected carpal tunnel syndrome.  The use o f IV contrast does not contribute to 
diagnosis and is usually not appropriate.

2. Explanation: The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of carpal tunnel syndrome, including numbness, tingling, and weakness in the outer part of the right hand. The physical examination findings, such as a positive Tinel's sign and carpal tunnel compression test, further support this diagnosis. Although carpal tunnel syndrome is typically diagnosed through clinical evaluation and electrophysiologic studies, the context information suggests that an MRI without IV contrast may be appropriate in cases where the initial evaluation is equivocal. Given that the patient's X-rays showed no significant abnormality, an MRI could provide additional information to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment decisions.

including nerve enlargement, nerve flattening, and retinacular bowing—may be associated with clinical severity but have limited usefulness in patients with clinically recognized carpal tunnel syndrome and low predictive value 
in patients with nonspecific wrist pain [ 68]. In rare cases of secondary carpal tunnel syndrome, MRI may identify 
a mass lesion compressing the median nerve. There is some evidence that the length of T2 hyperintensity in the 
median nerve can help prognosticate the success of surgery [69] and that the shape and signal of the nerve predict 
clinical response to a steroid injection in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome [70 ]. MR neurography 
may be an option in patients with suspected carpal tunnel syndrome.  The use o f IV contrast does not contribute to 
diagnosis and is usually not appropriate.

Discussion of Procedures by Variant  
Variant 1: Chronic wrist pain. With or without prior injury. Best initial study.  
Radiographs  
While there is no recent literature that directly addresses the role of first-line examinations for chronic wrist pain, 
radiographs are usually  appropriate as an initial study. Radiographs are widely available , and for many bone, 
joint, and alignment abnormalities, radiographs alone are diagnostic. In other patients, nonspecific radiologic findings (including those in the soft  tissues) combined with the history and physical examination may be 
sufficient for clinical diagnosis, or may suggest preferred secondary imaging studies.

2. Explanation: The patient is a 55-year-old former athlete with chronic bilateral hip pain, sometimes with a locking sensation. These symptoms could be indicative of a labral tear or other intra-articular pathology. Given the patient's history and symptoms, an MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the initial imaging study. This is because MRI can demonstrate pathology about the hip, including labral tears, which could be the source of the patient's symptoms.

Postoperative  greater  trochanter  pain may be due to greater  trochanteric bursitis, or other  etiologies  such as gluteus  
minimus  or medius  tendinitis , or tears or avulsion [73]. Trochanteric bursitis  is reported  to occur  in up to 17% of 
hips after THA and may be related  to the surgical  approach  [144,145] . 
CT Hip 
CT is less optimal  than MRI  for assessing  soft tissues [22]. Fractures and fluid  collections can be identified  on CT. 
Image -Guided Anesthetic +/- Corticosteroid  Injection  Hip Joint  or Surrounding  Structures  
If trochanteric bursitis  is thought  to be a source of pain,  Robbins  et al [144]  suggest  the bursa  may be injected  with 
either  lidocaine  alone  as a diagnostic  test, or in combination with a corticosteroid  as a therapeutic measure.

2. Explanation: The patient is a young, active individual with chronic hip pain and a positive anterior impingement test. The X-rays were unremarkable, suggesting that the pain may not be due to any obvious osseous abnormalities. The ordered MR arthrography of the hip is usually appropriate in this scenario as it can help identify intra-articular abnormalities such as a labral tear, which could be the source of the patient's symptoms. This aligns with the ACR Appropriateness Criteria for chronic hip pain.

Special Imaging  Considerations  
Knee radiographs  should include at least one frontal projection of one or both knees (anteroposterior, Rosenberg, 
or tunnel), a tangential patellar view , and a lateral view of the affected knee [2,9]. Standing radiographs more 
accurately reflect medial and lateral compartment cartilage loss than supine radiographs with the posteromedial and posterolateral joint compartments  more accurately assessed using a weight -bearing flexion posteroanterior 
radiograph [9,10].

Bone marrow lesions (BML) are readily depicted on MRI as areas of increased edema-like signal in the 
subchondral bone.  New or increasing BMLs are associated with increased knee pain, especially in males or 
patients with family history of osteoarthritis [22].  Conversely, decreasing BMLs are associated with reduced knee 
pain [23]. A systematic review of 22 articles concluded that both BMLs and synovitis/effusion may indicate the 
origin of knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [24- 26].

US is reported  to be 98% sensitive and 94% specific for calcium  hydroxyapatite  in the rotator  cuff tendons  [71], 
although  identification  may be challenging if the area of calcium  deposition  is small . At times  US may have  
difficulty  distinguishing calcific  deposits  from  heterotopic  ossification  because both can result  in dense shadowing  
at US. US can be used if there  is concern  for concomitant  rotator  cuff tendon tear and may be a better  modality  than 
MRI in this situation  given the difficulty  of distinguishing  calcium  from  normal  tendon at MRI.

demonstrated to be inferior to MRI in assessment of labroligamentous, osseous, and rotator cuff pathology [ 17]. 
US can b e considered as a screening tool in patients with persistent nonspecific shoulder pain after trauma, 
particularly in an older patient population in whom rotator cuff tears are more common. However, a low threshold 
should be maintained for performing additi onal imaging in the setting of a noncontributory shoulder US  
exam ination . 
CT Shoulder  
CT has virtually no usefulness in diagnosing common traumatic soft -tissue injuries such as rotator cuff tears, 
labroligamentous injuries, and muscle tears. Although CT is  the gold standard for diagnosing and characterizing 
fractures, MRI has been shown to be equivalent to CT in diagnosing the nondisplaced fractures that are typically 
missed on radiographs.

2. Explanation: The patient is presenting with left hip pain post total hip replacement. The MRI hip without IV contrast can demonstrate pathology about the hip, but it cannot be used to quantify the amount of pain that is generated from the hip pathology. However, it can help in identifying any complications or issues related to the hip replacement such as loosening of the prosthesis, infection, or other abnormalities. Given the patient's symptoms and history, an MRI can provide valuable information to guide further management.

2. Explanation: The patient is presenting with hip pain after a fall, post total hip replacement. X-rays have been done which show no periprosthetic fracture or loosening. The next appropriate step for further assessment, as per the context provided, would be an MRI of the hip. MRI is a useful tool for evaluating complications unrelated to metal wear after total hip arthroplasty, as mentioned in the context (Burge AJ. Total hip arthroplasty: MR imaging of complications unrelated to metal wear. Semin Musculoskelet Radiol  2015;19:31- 9). It can help in detecting and characterising periprosthetic fluid collection and other abnormalities (Aliprandi A, Sconfienza LM, Randelli F, Bandirali M, Di Leo G, Sardanelli F.

2. Explanation: The patient is presenting with hip pain and fever one month after a hip hemiarthroplasty, which could indicate a possible infection. The patient's elevated total white blood cell count and CRP also support this suspicion. An MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate in this scenario as it can help assess for implant infection, especially when X-rays do not show any obvious signs of infection such as periprosthetic fracture or loosening. The patient's history of poorly controlled diabetes and end stage renal failure also make him more susceptible to infections.

accurate MRI protocols.  
With the diagnostic accuracy of noncontrast MRI approaching 100%, there has been little need to explore the 
addition of IV  gadolinium contrast solely for the purposes of fracture detection. Rather , the interest has been in 
the use of dynamic MRI to evaluate femoral head perfusion for prognostic purpose to estimate the risks of 
impaired perfusion,  such as osteonecrosis and non union. In one study of 36 patients, impaired femoral head 
perfusion was mor e common in patients with displaced fractures,  although there was considerable overlap of 
perfusion pattern and fracture type [44]. The accuracy of predicting successful osseous union was 75% based on 
fracture morphology and improved incrementally to 89% on the basis of perfusion dynamics. Only 2 of 16

2. Explanation: The patient is experiencing severe pain in the left knee after a fall, which could indicate a periprosthetic fracture. Although the X-rays did not show any obvious periprosthetic fracture or loosening, the presence of a large suprapatellar effusion suggests that there may be an underlying injury that is not visible on X-ray. An MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate in this scenario to assess for radiographically occult periprosthetic fractures, as it can provide detailed images of the soft tissues and bones around the knee joint.

3-Phase  Bone  Scan  Knee  
Radionuclide  3-phase bone  scans can demonstrate  increased  activity  at a site of periprosthetic  fracture  and can show  
fractures that are radiographically occult  [137, 138]. In older  osteopen ic individuals  with low rates  of bone  
remodeling,  it may take 48 to 72 hours  for the development  of increased  radionuclide  activity  at the site of fracture.  
Within  1 to 2 years after prosthesis surgery,  the differential  diagnosis  for increased  periprosthetic  activity  would  
include  postoperative  change;  however,  with serial  imaging,  this postoperative activity  should decrease over time,  
whereas activity  increasing  over time would be suggestive of a prosthetic  complication, such as a periprosthetic

• Variant 2: Image -guided aspiration knee is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for suspected 
infection after TKA following radiography.  
• Variant 3: In the setting of a painful knee prosthesis evaluated with radiography and when infection has been 
excluded, MRI knee without IV contrast or CT knee without IV contrast is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for  aseptic loosening or osteolysis or instability. These procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, 
only one procedure will be ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).

preoperatively.  Duff  et al [18] noted that diagnosis  of infection  was not obvious  in 53% of knees before  revision  
arthroplasty.  Pain is the most  common  presenting  symptom  of infection, but pain is a nonspecific finding [47]. In 
acute infection,  findings  such as pain,  swelling,  warmth,  erythema,  and fever  are common,  whereas chronic  
infections  may be manifested  by pain alone  [44]. Night  pain or pain at rest is characteristic of infection, whereas  
pain on weightbearing  is more  characteristic of mechanical  loosening.  Some  authors  suggest  that infection  needs to 
be excluded  in all patients  with pain persisting  >6 months  after joint replacement  [18].

The use of both without and with IV contrast can provide a more detailed image of the area of interest. According to the context provided, an MRI of the area of interest without and with IV contrast has a rating of 5, which falls under the category of ""May be appropriate"".

2. Explanation: The patient is over 65 years old and presents with low back pain (LBP) and a history of osteopenia, which puts her at risk for osteoporotic fractures. An X-ray has already shown a moderate compression fracture at L1. Given her age, symptoms, and initial imaging findings, further imaging with an MRI is usually appropriate to assess the acuity of the vertebral fracture, determine if there is any spinal canal compromise, and distinguish between malignant and benign compression fractures. This is in line with the ACR Appropriateness Criteria for Low Back Pain.
3. Recommendation: NO CHANGE REQUIRED",USUALLY APPROPRIATE,NO CHANGE REQUIRED,"- Source: ACR low back pain.pdf, page 6
- Page Content: ages 65 and older being screened for osteoporosis, patients  >65 years of age may be considered at risk for 
osteoporotic fracture when presenting with LBP . 
Additionally,  for those  patients without  neurologic  compromise  and who present  with minor  risk factors for cancer,  
inflammatory  back  disease  (eg, ankylosing spondylitis), vertebral  compression  fracture,  or symptomatic  spinal  
stenosis,  imaging  should be considered  after a trial of therapy  [4]. 
In the majority  of patients, no specific pathology for LBP can be identified. Also,  studies have  shown  imaging  
abnormalities  in a substantial  number  of people  without back  pain [11-13]. The challenge for the clinician, therefore,  
is to distin guish the small  segment  within  this large patient  population that should be evaluated  further because of 
suspicion  of a more  serious  problem  or identify  pathology that requires intervention .

Radiography Lumbar  Spine  
In patients  with history  of osteoporosis  or steroid  use, initial evaluation  with radiography  is useful  [55]. Radiography

bone  marrow  edema and in demonstrating spinal  canal  compromise,  for example from  displaced  or retropulsed  
fractures.  For imaging  evaluation  and management  of vertebral  compression  fractures,  please see the ACR

2. Explanation: The patient presents with a superficial soft tissue mass on her right thigh. This is her initial imaging, and the ordered scan is an MRI of the area of interest without and with IV contrast. According to the ACR Appropriateness Criteria for Soft Tissue Masses, an MRI without and with IV contrast is usually appropriate for the next imaging study after a non-diagnostic radiograph and non-contrast-enhanced ultrasound. In this case, the MRI is being used as the initial imaging study, which is still appropriate given the nature of the mass and the patient's concern for cancer.

2. Explanation: The patient is a young, active individual who has developed severe foot pain after a strenuous activity, which is suggestive of a possible stress fracture. The tenderness on deep palpation of the 2nd and 3rd metatarsals further supports this suspicion. Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, an MRI without IV contrast is usually appropriate to assess for a stress fracture, as it can provide detailed images of the bones and surrounding soft tissues, helping to identify any possible fractures or other injuries that may be causing the patient's pain.

The second -line test to diagnose a stress fracture should be guided by the location of the patient ’s pain and 
likelihood of high-risk injury. A follow -up radiographic examination has increased sensitivity compared to initial 
radiographs [8] but is less sensitive than MRI. MRI is extremely sensitive and demonstrates stress abnormalities 
as early as bone scintigraphy and with as much sensitivity [ 11-14]. The recent literature favors MRI as the 
procedure of choice for making an early diagnosis of both varieties of stress fractures [ 15-28 ]. MRI is also 
considerably more specifi c than bone scintigraphy [ 19,23]. Stress injuries in athletes that are not identified and 
managed in a timel y fashion can progress to more serious fractures. Preventive strategies, including identifying 
and modifying risk factors, may help deter progression to frank fractures [31,44,45]. 
A circumstance that deserves specific attention is the longitudinal stress fracture, particularly in the tibia. Up to

myelography is inferior to MRI in assessing cord contus ion, cord hemorrhage, and postganglionic nerve root

2. Explanation: The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a progressive neurologic deficit, including numbness and tingling in all 4 limbs, reduced power, and difficulty controlling continence. These symptoms could indicate a condition such as Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES) or myelopathy, which are considered ""red flags"" in the context of back pain. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria recommends an urgent MRI assessment in all patients who present with new-onset urinary symptoms in the context of low back pain or sciatica. Furthermore, the patient's history of systemic lupus erythematosus could potentially be related to her current symptoms, as lupus can affect the nervous system. Therefore, an MRI of the whole spine without and with IV contrast is usually appropriate to evaluate for potential myelopathy or other neurologic conditions.

both the flexor and extensor wrist compartments [46]. Occult ganglion cysts are also easily identified with MRI, 
but some authors recommend use of IV contrast to distinguish ganglia from synovitis [ 47]. For noncystic soft-
tissue masses, MRI may demonstrate findings that are diagnostic for certain benign conditions (eg, lipomas, 
hemangiomas, benign nerve sheath tumors), and can stage the extent of involvement for nonspecific masses ( see 
the ACR Appropriateness Criteria® topic on “ Soft-Tissue Masses ” [48]). 
US Wrist  
Wrist US or MRI (without or without  and with IV contrast) are alternative initial examinations that are usually 
appropriate in this setting. US  is useful for examining extra -articular soft tissue s, such as suspected ganglion cysts 
[17],  with an accuracy similar to that  of MRI.

persistent  or progressive  symptoms  during or following  6 weeks of conservative management  but is sometimes  
useful  if noncontrast  MRI is nondiagnostic  or indeterminate.  Contrast  can help distinguish  residual/recurrent  disc 
from  fibrosis/scar  in a postoperative  patient  (see Variant  5). 
MRI Lumbar Spine Without IV Contrast  
Patients  presenting  with subacute or chronic  LBP or radiculopathy  who have  failed  6 weeks of conservative therapy , 
and with physical  examination  signs  of nerve  root irritation , should  be imaged  if they are believed  to be candidates 
for surgery  or intervention  or if diagnostic  uncertainty  remains.  Accurate diagnosis  of disc disease can be provided  
by MRI [7].

MRI Lumbar Spine With IV Contrast  
MRI lumbar  spine  with IV contrast  is not typically  performed  independently as an initial study,  as its interpretation  
is most  informative  when  correlated  with standard  noncontrast  sequences included in MRI lumbar  spine  with and 
without  IV contrast  [33]. 
MRI Lumbar Spine Without and With IV Contrast  
MRI lumbar  spine  without  and with IV contrast  is useful  as it accurately  distinguishes  recurrent  or residual  disc 
herniations  from  scar, and can evaluate for nerve  root compression  or arachnoiditis  in patients  with new or 
progressive  symptoms  and previous  lumbar  surgery  [43]. It can also help identify  and evaluate extent  of infection .

CT lumbar spine without and with IV contrast  is not typically  performed  as there is no diagnostic  advantage  to 
performing  a single  study with or without IV contrast.  
CT Lumbar Spine Without IV Contrast  
CT lumbar  spine  without  IV contrast  can be helpful  in assessing  osseous fusion.  CT can detect  potentially  painful  
hardware failure , including  prosthetic  loosening,  malalignment, or metallic  fracture [44]. Additionally, CT lumbar  
spine  without  IV contrast  is equal  to MRI  for predicting  significant  spinal  stenosis  and excluding  cauda equina  
impingement  [27]. 
CT Myelography Lumbar  Spine  
CT myelography of the lumbar  spine  can be useful  in assessing  the patency  of the spinal  canal/thecal  sac and of the 
subarticular  recesses and neural  foramen  [22]. It has safety  advantages over MRI  for patients  who have  implanted

- Page Content: MRI lumbar  spine  without  and with IV contrast  is useful  for this group.  For malignant/metastatic  disease,  MRI is 
preferred  as both bony/marrow  involvement  and neural  compression  from  epidural  tumor  are visualized  with high 
spatial  resolution  [62]. In a patient  with suspected  spinal  infection, MRI without  and with IV contrast  is preferred  
because of its  high sensitivity  and specificity. MRI can localize  the site of infection  and assess the extent  of 
extradural/epidural  and paravertebral  involvement  [65,67] , and is helpful  to distinguish  abscess from  phlegmon 
[67]. 
MRI Lumbar Spine Without IV Contrast  
MRI lumbar  spine  without  IV can be a sufficient  imaging  study  if there is low risk of epidural  and/or  intraspinal  
disease.  It is highly  sensitive for bone  marrow  abnormalities , and with a combination of noncontrast  T1-weighted  
and short tau inversion recovery sequences it can distinguish whether  they are benign or malignant  [62].",TRUE

Compared to noncontrast  MRI, MR arthrography  has been shown to have increased sensitivity for detection of 
anterior labral and SLAP tears [19]. In addition, MR arthrography has been shown to detect unsuspected labral

MR arthrography is the preferred exam ination  for the evaluation of subacute shoulder dislocations or recurrent 
shoulder instability. MRI has been shown to have similar performance to CT in the evaluation of Hill-Sachs 
lesions and glenoid bone loss [12,18]. MR arthrography has also been found to be reliable in diagnosi ng anterior 
shoulder instability and labroligamentous injuries [58,59]. MR arthrography has specifically o utperformed 
noncontrast MRI in assessment of glenohumeral ligament and anterior labral injuries [ 17,19], which ar e 
commonly seen in shoulder instability. MR arthrogr aphy has also outperformed noncontrast MRI in diagnosis of 
rotator cuff tears [17,19], which is a common associated finding in older patients with shoulder dislocation.
