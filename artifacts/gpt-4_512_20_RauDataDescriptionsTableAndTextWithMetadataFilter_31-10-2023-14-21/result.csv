Page Content: Altho ugh the technology holds promise, diagnostic accuracy does not yet 
approach that of MRI , with an  initial study by Reddy et al [49] demonstrating a sensitivity of 90% and specificity 
of 40% for nondisplaced femoral neck fractures . However, this may be a modality of emerging imp ortance as 
technology improves.  
US Hip 
The use of US  for evaluation of the acutely painful hip has been evaluated in a single study of 10 patients  with hip 
fractures [36]. Although US was able to identify trauma-related changes,  such as joint effusion , with 100% 
sensitivity , specificity for fracture reached only 65%. The authors acknowledged that performance might further 
decrease for examinations performed by sonographers and radiologists not experienced with musculoskeletal US . 
For this document , it is assumed the procedure is performed and interpreted by an expert.  Given the inability of 
US to comprehensively evaluate the bones and soft  tissues of the pelvis, there is not enough evidence to support 
the role of US  in the workup of radiographically occult hip fracture.

Page Content: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® 6 Acute Hip Pain -Suspected Fracture  Bone Scan H ips 
Prior to the advent of MRI, a bone scan was the preferred test for radiographically occult proximal femoral 
fractures. However, as early as 1993 , Rizzo et al [50] demonstrated MRI to be at least as accurate as bone scan s 
and with substantially decreased time to diagnosis. A later study by  Rubin et al [51] comparing bone scan s and 
MRI demonstrated i mproved sensitivity and specificity of MRI relative to bone scans . Moreover, t he bone scan 
group averaged an additional day to surgery.  
Bone scintigraphy is a time-consuming process. Bone scans may be falsely negative for up to 72 hours from the 
time of in jury, and false-positive scans are likewise common, related to osteoarthritis, soft -tissue injury , or any 
other process that may increase bone turnover [50] . It has been postulated that performing single -photon emission 
computed tomography may combine the sensitivity of bone scintig raphy with the spatial accuracy of CT , but there 
are no data to support this view. In current practice, the role of bone scan s as a secondary line of imaging in 
patients with contraindications to MRI has largely been usurped by CT.  
Summary of Recommendations 
• Variant 1:  Radiographs  of the hip, radiographs  of the pelvis, or radiographs  of the pelvis and hips is usually 
appropriate for the initial imaging of the hip with acute pain, fall or minor trauma, and suspected fracture.  
• Variant 2:  MRI pelv is and affected hip without IV contrast  or CT pelvis and hips without IV contrast is 
usually appropriate as the next imaging study for the evaluation of a cute hip pain from a fall or minor trauma  
with negative radiographs  and suspected fracture.

variation between studies, the estimated prev alence of occult fracture after negative radiographs has  been 
estimated  at 4% to 10% , indicating the inability of negative radiographs alone to exclude fracture [21,26] . Risk 
factors for radiographically occult fracture in these studies included those age >65, low -force trauma,  such as a 
ground-level fall , and female gender. These studies have almost exclusively included elderly patients.  There is no 
relevant literature regarding the sensitivity and specificity of radiographs in the younger patient population,  and 
clinicians are suggested to proceed with caution.  
Radiography Pelvis  
There is no specific literature  regarding the use of an AP view of the pelvis  alone  for acute hip pain following 
low-force trauma.  Previous literature regarding the accuracy of radiography has almost exclusively evaluated AP 
and cross-table lateral radiographs of the hip or the combined use of AP pelvis and hip radiographs. However, i t is 
well established that patients with clinically  suspected proximal femur fracture often have fractures of the pelvis,  
including the sacrum and pubic rami [21,27-30] . Therefore , it has been  recommended that the radiographic series 
include the AP view of the pelvis along with the orthogonal  views  of the symptomatic hip [31] . The inclusion of a 
pelvis radiograph also allows for comparison of potential abnormalities to the contralateral asymptomatic side.  
Pelvis radiographs share the same limitations in sensitivity  and specificity  for fracture detection as hip 
radiographs , and a negative radiograph alone cannot exclude fracture .

As previously discussed, p atients with clinically suspected proximal femur fracture often have fractures of the

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Fractures of the proximal femur (commonly referred to as hip fractures)  are a frequent  source of morbidity and 
mortality in elderly osteoporotic patients [1]. Typically the result of a ground -level fall, fractures of this type 
result in approximately 300,000 hospitalizations per year  and are nearly twice as common in women as in men 
[2,3] . As the United States population continues to age, the incidence of hip fractures and associated medical costs 
will continue to rise, predicted to reach $18 billion by 2025 [4]. Patients suffer a substantial decline in quality of 
life following a hip fracture [5] as well as a 1-year mortality  rate of 22% for women and 33% for men [1]. Delays 
in diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased cost, complication rate, length of hospital stay, and short -
and long-term mortality [6-13]. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of hip fractures is critical. Hip fractures 
cannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded on the basis of physical exam ination  alone ; therefore , imaging plays a 
key role in early  and accurate diagnosis [14] .",True

2. According to the context, for acute hip pain with suspected fracture due to a fall or minor trauma, the initial imaging of choice is radiography of the hip or pelvis. More advanced imaging modalities like MRI or CT are reserved for instances of clinically suspected fracture in the setting of negative or equivocal radiographs.

Page Content: It is general  
agreement  that radiographs  should be obtained  and the clinical  decision  rule should not be applied  for patients with 
gross  deformity  [3], a palpable  mass  [10], a penetrating  injury,  prosthetic  hardware,  an unreliable  clinical  history  
or physical  examination  secondary  to multiple  injuries  [3,10] , altered  mental  status (eg, head  injury, drug or alcohol  
use, dementia)  [3,10] , neuropathy (eg, paraplegia,  diabetes)  [3,10] , or a history  suggesting  increased  risk of fracture.  
Additionally , in any case scenario,  the physician’s judgment  and common  sense should supersede clinical  guidelines  
[3]. 
Bone  Scan  with  SPECT  or SPECT/CT  Knee  
In patients  with significant  acute knee  trauma  with suspected/possible dislocation , Tc-99m  bone  scan with 
SPECT/CT is not routinely  used as the initial imaging  study.  
US Knee  
In patients  with significant  acute knee  trauma  with suspected  or possible  dislocation , US is not routinely  used as 
the initial imaging  study.  
Summary  of Recommendations 
• Variant  1: Knee radiographs  may be appropriate  for the initial imaging  of patients  5 years of age or older  for 
the evaluation  of a fall or acute twisting  trauma  to the knee  when  there is no focal  tenderness,  no effusion,  and 
they are able to walk .

Variant  1: Adult  or child 5 years of age or older . Fall or acute  twisting  trauma  to the knee.  No focal  
tenderness,  no effusion, able to walk.  Initial imaging.  
CT Knee  
In the absence of focal  tenderness and joint effusion  in a patient  who is able to walk,  CT is not used as the initial  
imaging study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the knee.  
MR Arthrography  Knee  
MR arthrography  is not routinely  used as the initial imaging  study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the knee.  
MRA Knee

knee.  
MRI Knee  
MRI is not routinely  used as the initial imaging study  for the evaluation  of acute trauma  to the knee.  
Radiography Knee  
With no clinical  symptoms  in the injured  knee , including lack of focal  tenderness and joint effusion , and with ability  
to walk,  knee  radiographs  may be indicated  if a patient  >55 years old per Ottawa rules or >50 years old or <12 years 
old per Pittsburgh  rule criteria [5, 6, 10]. If the patient  is between  5 and 12 years,  they fall outside  the age range  for 
both the Ottawa and Pittsburgh  rules and radiographs  may be beneficial  despite lack of clinical  symptoms.  
Radiographs  are commonly  performed  in the setting  of acute knee  injuries  but have  a low yield  for showing  
fractures.  In a retrospective review of 1,967 patients  with acute knee  injuries  by Stiell et al [2], 74.1%  of patients  
had knee  radiography,  and only 5.2%  of these had fractures.

MRI Elbow  
MRI elbow  may detect  loose  bodies,  and this is enhanced  in the presence of joint fluid.  Thus,  T2-weighted  images  
are recommended for the evaluation  of loose  bodies  in the elbow  [17]. MRI may also show  the presence of enlarged  
plica,  which  can result  in symptoms  of locking  and/or  pain with extension  [15]. MRI is often  suggested  as the initial  
study to assess for osteochondral  lesion  [12,17] . MRI  is less sensitive  than radiographs  in the detection  of 
heterotopic  ossification/calcification  [18]. Similar  to MR arthrography,  MRI elbow  is limited  in the evaluation  of 
cartilage defects [16]. 
US Elbow  
Although US may demonstrate  early -stage osteochondral  lesions and medial  epicondylar  fragmentation  [10], the 
details  of an osteochondral  lesion  are better  defined  by CT arthrography or MR arthrography.  Because of

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic  elbow  pain is a common  patient  complaint  in the primary  care setting. Patients  may report  symptoms  of 
swelling,  pain,  restricted  range  of motion,  stiffness,  and numbness  or tingling  [1]. There is a wide  differential  
diagnosis  for chronic  elbow  pain, including osseous,  soft tissue,  cartil aginous , and nerve -related  abnormalities.  
Epicondylalgia , caused  by tendinosis  of the common  extensor  tendon laterally  (“tennis elbow”)  or medially  the 
common  flexor  tendon  (“golfer’s  elbow ”), is the most  common  cause of chronic  elbow  pain,  estimated  to occur in 
1% to 3% of the population  [2]. Epicondylalgia  is associated  with lost workdays  and a significant  economic  burden  
[3].",True

MRI has high inter- and intraobserver  reliability  for the diagnosi s of epicondylalgia  [26]. It also has a sensitivity  of 
90% to 100%  and a specificity  of 83% to 100%  [27]. The most  specific findings  of medial  epicondylalgia  include  
interm ediate to high T2 signal  or high T2 signal  within  the common  flexor  tendon  and paratendinous  soft tissue  
edema [28]. MRI has the benefit  of demonstrating associated  findings  in epicondylalgia , including radial  collateral  
and lateral  UCL  injuries  [26]. MRI may also facilitate  surgical  planning [29]. 
MRI is useful  for the diagnosis  of biceps  tendon injury.  Sensitivity  and specificity  are reported  at 92.4%  and 100%,  
respectively,  in detecting  distal  biceps tendon  ruptures  and 59.1%  and 100%,  respectively  for partial  tears [30]. 
US Elbow  
US elbow  has moderate agreement  with MR elbow  for the diagnosis  and grading of common  extensor  tendon tears.  
US sensitivity, specificity,  and accuracy  are reported  at 64.25%,  85.19%,  and 72.73% , respectively  [31]. Recently,  
sonoelastography  has shown more  promising outcomes for detection  of medial  epicondylalgia  with a sensitivity,  
specificity,  accuracy,  positive  predictive  value , and negative  predictive  value  of 95.2%,  92%,  93.5%,  90.9%,  and

Page Content: Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain. Radiographs represent the first imaging  study  
usually perfo rmed to evaluate the first metatarsal sesamoids and may be useful to diagnose sesamoid dislocation, 
osteoarthritis, or to distinguish between bipartite versus fractured sesamoid. Differentiation between a bipartite 
versus a fractured sesamoid and diagnosis of other conditions affecting the sesamoids remains  difficult to assess 
with radiographs  [12]. Radiographs are insensitive to diagnose Morton’s  neuroma  but are useful to exclude other 
causes of webspace pain such as osteoarthritis, Freiberg’s infraction , and stress fractures. Splaying of the metatarsals 
or soft -tissue density may be demonstrated but are not diagnostic [14] . 
Though radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in 
patients with a painful heel. Evid ence supports the use of weight bearing radiographs in this instance [5]. The 
combination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a 
specificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis [15]. 
US Foot  
Ultrasound (US) is usually not indicate d as the first imaging  study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain, but may 
be performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of pathologic conditions of the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, 
and other conditions such as tarsal tunnel syndrome, Morton’s  neuroma , plantar plate tears,  and intermetatarsal

Summary of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Chronic foot pain is a frequent clinical complaint with approximately 14% to 42% of adults in the United States 
reporting foot problems, often with significant impact on mobility, difficulty performing daily activities , and 
increased risk of falling, particularly in older individuals [1,2] . Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a 
significant improvement in health-related quality of life with effective treatment of foot pain [3] . Estimating the 
prevalence of chron ic foot pain is challenging, because there is no consensus regarding the definition of chronic 
pain in the literature. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines chronic pain as any pain persisting 
past the normal healing time, suggesting 3 months in case of chronic pain of benign causes.  
Women are more commonly affected , and forefoot conditions are more frequent. Persistent pain for more than 6  
years has been reported in 51% of women between 70 to 75 years of age [4]. Because of  the wide range of causes 
of chronic foot pain, assessment of these patients with imaging studies in addition to a dedicated clinical 
examination is often needed [1] .

Bone Scan Foot with SPECT or SPECT/CT  
SPECT/CT has been found to be of use when investigating heel pain with increased specificity when compared to 
bone scintigraphy alone , because of  the improved anatomic localization of metabolic activity. Despite the anatomic 
and functional advantages of SPECT/CT, MRI and high-frequency US remain the most frequently used imaging  
modalities in patients with heel pain [50]. A characteristic p attern of abnormal uptake on 3-phase bone scintigraphy 
has been proven helpful to differentiate plantar fasciitis from calcaneal stress or avulsion fractures [51]. There is no 
relevant literature  to support the routine use of nuclear medicine studies to diagnose plantar fascia l tears.

Bone Scan Foot  
There is no relevant literature  to support t he use of nuclear medicine studies as the first imaging  study  in the 
evaluation of chronic foot pain.  
CT Foot  
There is no relevant literature to support the use of CT as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot

There is no r elevant literature  to support the use of MRI as the first imaging  study in the e valuation of chronic foot

Radiography Foot  
Conventional radiography can be useful to distinguish among different causes of chronic foot pain and is usually 
the first imag ing study in evaluating patients with chronic foot pain.  
The value of radiographs in the diagnosis of tarsal coalitions has been extensively demonstrated. Overall 
sensitivities rang e from 80% to 100% and specificities range  from 97% to 98% have been report ed for radiographs 
in the diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Most calcaneonavicular coalitions are easily detected on lateral 
and oblique radiographs of the foot and confirmed on sagittal CT or MRI scans [11]. Talocalcaneal or subtalar 
coalition may be  overlooked on standard foot radiographs due to overlapping structures; however, secondary signs 
on the lateral view could suggest a subtalar coalition. An overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% have 
been found for radiographs in the diagnosi s of talocalcaneal coalitions [12] . CT and MRI remain the most reliable 
methods for diagnosing subtalar coalitions.  
Radiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review 
by Wright et al [13] reported sensitivities rangi ng from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for 
radiographs in the detection of lower -extremity stress fractures.  
Radiographs  are useful to assess several causes of forefoot pain.

Variant  3: Inflammatory back  pain.  Suspected  axial  spondyloarthritis . Negative  radiographs  and negative  
MRI of the sacroiliac  joints.  Next  imaging  study.  
The body regions covered in this clinical scenario are the sacroiliac joints, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine. 
These body regions might be evaluated separately or in combination as guided by physical examination findings, 
patient history, and other available information. 
 
Bone  Scan  with  SPECT  or SPECT/CT  Spine  Area  of Interest  
Bone  scintigraphy is not routinely  suggested  in the evaluation  of patients  with suspected  axSpA  because of  its lack 
of established  diagnostic  utility  [22]. Conventional  bone  scintigraphy has low to moderate sensitivity  and variable  
specificity  for the diagnosis  of axSpA  [41,42,50] . If bone  scintigraphy is used,  because of  the complexity  of the 
spine anatomy,  the use of SPECT should be performed  during  the examination  [51]. Although  bone  scintigraphy is 
not typically  performed  during the evaluation  of suspected  axSpA  because of  its limited  diagnostic  utility, there is 
recent  data that hybrid SPECT/CT has higher  sensitivity  than conventional  bone  scintigraphy in the detection  of 
sacroiliitis  [52,53] , although  there  is not enough evidence at this time to support  its routine  use for evaluating  the 
sacroiliac joints  or spine . 
CT Spine  Area  of Interest  
CT demonstrates structural  changes in the spine  that may not be apparent  on radiographs  [22], including structural  
changes such as erosions,  sclerosis,  bone  formation,  syndesmophytes,  and ankyloses  [49,54] .

of the sacroiliac joints  and spine  in axSpA  [9,107-111,125 -129] . The Spondyloarthritis  Research  Consortium  of

Radiography Sacroiliac  Joints   
There is no standard  method of following  patients  with radiographs  to evaluate for progression of structural  changes  
[22], and the American  College  of Rheumatology recommends against  routine  radiographic  follow -up given  the 
lack of proven benefit  [30]. Repeat  radiographs  can be obtained as necessary  for counseling  patients  on the status  
and prognosis  of their disease,  although radiographs  are more  typically  performed  to evaluate the spine  rather  than 
the sacroiliac  joints  [30]. This is because of  the low utility  of sacroiliac joint radiographs  for detecting  disease  
progression based  on the relatively  poor intra- and interreader  reliability  of interpretation  [141] . Radiographs  can 
demonstrate evolving  structural  changes or bone  formation,  although these changes occur  slowly  over time at the 
sacroiliac joints, often  requiring  years to detect  a change and prompting many  authors  to suggest  a radiographic  
imaging  interval  of axSpA  patients  of no less than 2 years for assessment  of disease progression [141- 146]. There 
is evidence that patients  on TNF -inhibitors  may have  slower  progression of structural  damage at the sacroiliac joints  
[147,148] , although there is some  disagreement  in the literature  [149] .

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
Axial  spondyloarthritis  or axial  spondyloarthropathy (axSpA)  describes a heterogeneous  group of inflammatory  
disorders  affecting  the axial  skeleton  that were historically  classified  separately  as ankylosing  spondylitis  (AS) , 
reactive arthritis, psoriatic  spondyloarthritis,  enteropathic  spondyloarthritis,  juvenile  spondyloarthritis , and 
undifferentiated  spondyloarthritis  [1]. The prevalen ce of axSpA  is estimated  to be between  0.9% to 1.4%  in the 
United  States  adult  population [2]. There  is a genetic component  to axSpA,  including  a strong  association  with 
HLA-B27 , which  is positive  in 74% to 89% of patients  [1]. Patients  with axSpA  often  present  before  age 45 with 
chronic  back  pain and stiffness and may have  elevated  inflammatory  markers  [3].

Variant  3: Inflammatory back  pain.  Suspected  axial  spondyloarthritis . Negative  radiographs  and negative  
MRI of the sacroiliac  joints.  Next  imaging  study.  
The body regions covered in this clinical scenario are the sacroiliac joints, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine. 
These body regions might be evaluated separately or in combination as guided by physical examination findings, 
patient history, and other available information. 
 
Bone  Scan  with  SPECT  or SPECT/CT  Spine  Area  of Interest  
Bone  scintigraphy is not routinely  suggested  in the evaluation  of patients  with suspected  axSpA  because of  its lack 
of established  diagnostic  utility  [22]. Conventional  bone  scintigraphy has low to moderate sensitivity  and variable  
specificity  for the diagnosis  of axSpA  [41,42,50] . If bone  scintigraphy is used,  because of  the complexity  of the 
spine anatomy,  the use of SPECT should be performed  during  the examination  [51]. Although  bone  scintigraphy is 
not typically  performed  during the evaluation  of suspected  axSpA  because of  its limited  diagnostic  utility, there is 
recent  data that hybrid SPECT/CT has higher  sensitivity  than conventional  bone  scintigraphy in the detection  of 
sacroiliitis  [52,53] , although  there  is not enough evidence at this time to support  its routine  use for evaluating  the 
sacroiliac joints  or spine . 
CT Spine  Area  of Interest  
CT demonstrates structural  changes in the spine  that may not be apparent  on radiographs  [22], including structural  
changes such as erosions,  sclerosis,  bone  formation,  syndesmophytes,  and ankyloses  [49,54] .

• Saddle  anesthesia  
• Bilateral  or progressive  weakness in the lower  
limbs  • Cauda  equina  syndrome  or other  severe neurologic  
condition  
Previous  guidelines  have  suggested  that imaging  be performed  in adults  >50 years of age who present  with LBP. 
When  studied,  there was no statistically  significant  difference in primary  outcome  after 1 year for patients  aged  65 
years or older  who had spine  imaging  within  6 weeks after an initial  visit for care for LBP versus similar  patients  
who did not undergo early  imaging  [9]; thus,  this document  does not include  >50 years of age as an independent  
red flag. However, an important age-related risk factor for spinal fracture presenting as LBP  is osteoporosis.  As 
bone mass decreases slowly over time, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age, and differs by sex, race, 
ethnicity  [10], and comorbidities.

routine  imaging  in patients  with nonspecific  LBP. Duration  of symptoms  also helps  guide  treatment  algorithms  in

patient  history  is a strong predictor  of patients  who are predisposed  to developing chronic  disabling LBP problems  
[3]. 
Although there  is great  variability  in the definition  of acute and subacute  LBP, for the purposes  of this guideline,  
we will use the Institute  for Clinical Systems  Improvement  definitions  of 0 to 4 weeks to define  acute LBP,  4 to 12 
weeks for subacute LBP, and >12 weeks for chronic  LBP [5]. 
It is clear  that uncomplicated  acute  LBP and/or  radiculopathy is a benign,  self-limited  condition  that does not 
warrant  any imaging studies [4,6,7] . Imaging is considered  in those  patients who have  had up to 6 weeks of medical  
management  and physical  therapy  that resulted  in little or no improvement  in their back  pain.  It is also considered  
for those  patients  presenting  with red flags , raising  suspicion  for a serious underlying  condition,  such as cauda 
equina  syndrome  (CES),  malignancy,  fracture,  or infection  (see Table 1).

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
In the United  States,  acute low back  pain (LBP),  with or without radiculopathy , is the leading  cause of years lived  
with disability  and the third  ranking cause of disability -adjusted  life years  [1]. It is the fifth most  common  reason  
for a physician  visit in the United  States  and accounts for approximately  3% of visits  to the emergency  department  
[2]. 
The American  College  of Physicians and the American  Pain Society  classify  LBP into the following  broad  
categories:  nonspecific LBP, back  pain potentially  associated  with radiculopathy or spinal  stenosis,  and back  pain 
potentially  associated  with another  specific spinal  cause [3].

Deep tendon reflexes are brisk in both legs, with upgoing plantar reflexes bilaterally.
Scan ordered: X-ray lumbar spine","1. Relevant information from the patient profile includes:
   - Age: 55 years old
   - Symptoms: Difficulty in walking, numbness in lower extremities, progressive weakness in legs for the past year, decreased sensation to light touch and pinprick in both legs, bilateral weakness in hip flexion, knee extension, and ankle dorsiflexion, brisk deep tendon reflexes in both legs, upgoing plantar reflexes bilaterally.
   - Previous Diagnosis: Chronic lower back pain for the past 10 years, managed with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and physical therapy.
   - Stage of Diagnosis: This would be considered as a next study, given the patient's history of chronic lower back pain and new or progressing symptoms.

2. Referring to the reference information given under CONTEXT, the patient's profile aligns with the description of ""Low back pain with suspected cauda equina syndrome. Initial imaging."" The patient's symptoms of difficulty in walking, numbness in lower extremities, and progressive weakness in legs, along with the physical examination findings, suggest a possible cauda equina syndrome.

3. According to the CONTEXT, for a patient with low back pain and suspected cauda equina syndrome, the following imaging procedures are recommended:
   - MRI lumbar spine without and with IV contrast: Usually Appropriate
   - MRI lumbar spine without IV contrast: Usually Appropriate
   - CT lumbar spine without IV contrast: May Be Appropriate
   - CT myelography lumbar spine: May Be Appropriate
   - Radiography lumbar spine: Usually Not Appropriate

4. Based on the SCORING CRITERIA, the ordered scan, X-ray lumbar spine (Radiography lumbar spine), is USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE for this patient's condition. An MRI of the lumbar spine without IV contrast or an MRI of the lumbar spine without and with IV contrast would be more appropriate imaging procedures for this patient, given the suspicion of cauda equina syndrome.",USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE,MRI lumbar spine without IV contrast or MRI lumbar spine without and with IV contrast,"Metadata: description:  Low back pain with history of prior lumbar surgery and with or without radiculopathy.

Previous  guidelines  have  suggested  that imaging  be performed  in adults  >50 years of age who present  with LBP. 
When  studied,  there was no statistically  significant  difference in primary  outcome  after 1 year for patients  aged  65 
years or older  who had spine  imaging  within  6 weeks after an initial  visit for care for LBP versus similar  patients  
who did not undergo early  imaging  [9]; thus,  this document  does not include  >50 years of age as an independent  
red flag. However, an important age-related risk factor for spinal fracture presenting as LBP  is osteoporosis.  As 
bone mass decreases slowly over time, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age, and differs by sex, race, 
ethnicity  [10], and comorbidities.

Although there  is great  variability  in the definition  of acute and subacute  LBP, for the purposes  of this guideline,  
we will use the Institute  for Clinical Systems  Improvement  definitions  of 0 to 4 weeks to define  acute LBP,  4 to 12 
weeks for subacute LBP, and >12 weeks for chronic  LBP [5]. 
It is clear  that uncomplicated  acute  LBP and/or  radiculopathy is a benign,  self-limited  condition  that does not 
warrant  any imaging studies [4,6,7] . Imaging is considered  in those  patients who have  had up to 6 weeks of medical  
management  and physical  therapy  that resulted  in little or no improvement  in their back  pain.  It is also considered  
for those  patients  presenting  with red flags , raising  suspicion  for a serious underlying  condition,  such as cauda

Summary  of Literature Review  
Introduction/Background 
In the United  States,  acute low back  pain (LBP),  with or without radiculopathy , is the leading  cause of years lived  
with disability  and the third  ranking cause of disability -adjusted  life years  [1]. It is the fifth most  common  reason  
for a physician  visit in the United  States  and accounts for approximately  3% of visits  to the emergency  department  
[2]. 
The American  College  of Physicians and the American  Pain Society  classify  LBP into the following  broad  
categories:  nonspecific LBP, back  pain potentially  associated  with radiculopathy or spinal  stenosis,  and back  pain 
potentially  associated  with another  specific spinal  cause [3].

CES is rare and results from  dysfunction of the sacral  and lumbar  nerve  roots  within  the vertebral  canal  secondary  
to cauda equina  nerve  root compression , producing impairment  of the bladder,  bowel,  or sexual  function and 
perianal  or saddle numbness.  Back  pain with or without  radicular  symptoms,  weakness in the lower  limbs, sensory  
changes or numbness  in the lower  limbs,  or absent  lower  limb reflexes are other  symptoms  that have  been  described  
[38]. A review of physical  examination  findings  reported  by Fairbanks  et al [39] found LBP as the most  common  
physical  finding in patients  with the diagnosis  of CES.  The most  common  cause of CES is lumbar  disc herniation  
at the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels.  Other  etiologies  include  neoplasm,  infection/inflammation, spinal  stenosis,  and 
hemorrhage.  
Multifocal deficits  and progressive neurologic  deficits can be caused  by a number  of other  noncompressive  
etiologies  with some  overlapping clinical  features.  Please see the ACR Appropriateness Criteria® topic on

Page Content: ACR Appropr iateness  Criteria® 5 Suspected  Spine  Infection  Although  imaging  studies  have  a role in the diagnostic  evaluation  of suspected  spine  infection, a high index  of 
clinical  suspicion  for an infectious  etiology  is required  in order  to initiate  the clinical work up [47]. Important  
laboratory parameters that may be assessed  include  serum  erythrocyte  sedimentation  rate (ESR),  C-reactive protein  
(CRP),  white  blood  cell (WBC) count  with differential , and blood cultures [37,48-50] . Other  testing  such as for 
brucella or mycobacterium  may be helpful  if the patient  is from  the appropriate  endemic  area [2,4,5,7] . Because the 
imaging  appearance of spine  infection  may overlap  with other  noninfectious  pathologic  entities, such as 
degenerative disc disease,  inflammation, trauma , or neoplasm , spine  biopsy with microbiologic  and histopathologic  
analysis of the infected  tissue  is often  required  for diagnostic  confirmation  [35,51-58] . 
Speci al Imaging  Consid erations 
Although  the clinical  presentation  and physical  examination  can help localize the level  of suspected  spine  infection, 
in specific clinical  situations  it may be beneficial  to image  the entire  spine  [21,59] . This may be influenced by 
clinical  presentation  and patient  factors such as a history of IV drug use, specific pathogens  such as tuberculosis , or 
initial imaging  findings  that demonstrate  multilevel spine  involvement  [21,59-61] . 
Like other  spine  infections,  spinal  epidural  abscess has increased  in incidence and is now seen in 2.5 to 3/10,000  
patients  [3,60] . Epidural  abscess is often  associated  with diagnos tic delay  that can potentially  lead to significant  
neurologic  morbidity  and mortality.

Page Content: Potential host factors  include  preexisting  extraspinal  infection  (endocarditis,  HIV,  pulmonary infection),  
intravenous  (IV) drug use, diabetes mellitus, hepatic or renal  failure,  rheumatologic  disease,  or immunosuppression 
[12,13] . Spine  infection  presents a diagnostic  and management  challenge [14]. Diagnostic delay  is not uncommon  
because of an often  indolent  clinical  presentation  with nonspecific  presenting  signs  and symptoms  such as back  
pain,  fever , and, less commonly,  neurologic  compromise  [3,8,10] . The location  of the spine  infection  is also 
important  because it may influence  the clinical  presentation  and the subsequent  imaging  evaluation.  One or more  
spine  structures and/or  compartments may be infected , and this also influe nces the imaging  findings  [1,14] . Spine  
infection  is often  extradural , initially  invading  the vertebral  endplate  in adults via a hematogenous  route  and 
centering  about  the vertebral  endplate  (osteomyelitis)  and intervertebral  disc (discitis). Spine  infection  may also 
arise initially  within  a facet  joint. Spine  infection  occurs less frequently in children  and initially  affect s the 
intervertebral  disc [15]. Epidural  and paraspinal  soft tissue involvement  are not uncommon [16,17] . Other  important  
clinical  manifestations of spine  infection  with imaging  and management  implications  include  epidural  (abscess) , 
subarachnoid  (meningitis)  space  involvement , or spinal  cord involvement  (myelitis)  [18,19] .

infection  (preexisting  infection, IV drug use, recent  spine  procedure)  or a reason  for being immunosuppressed  
(diabetes,  steroid  use) and patients  with an elevated  ESR, may be at increased  risk for epidural  abscess  
[18,21,22,62] . 
Initial Imaging  Definition 
Initial imaging  is defined  as imaging  at the beginning of the care episode for the medical  condition defined  by the 
variant.  More  than one procedure  can be considered  usually  appropriate  in the initial imaging  evaluation  when : 
• There are procedures  that are equivalent  alternatives (ie, only one procedure  will be ordered  to 
provide  the clinical  information  to effectively  manage the patient’s  care)  
OR 
• There are complementary  procedures  (ie, more  than one procedure  is ordered  as a set or 
simultaneously  where each procedure  provides  unique  clinical  informatio n to effectively  manage  
the patient’s  care).  
Discussion  of Procedures  by Variant  
Variant  1: Suspected  spine infection (such  as epidural abscess or discitis  osteomyelitis),  with  new or 
worsening  back  or neck  pain, with  or without  fever,  who may have  one or more  of the following  red flags  
(diabetes  mellitus, IV drug  use, cancer,  HIV,  or dialysis)  or abnormal  lab values.  Initial imaging.  
The annual  incidence of spine  infection  ranges from  4 to 24 per million  per year [10]. In the presence of red flag 
conditions  (diabetes mellitus, IV drug use, cancer,  HIV,  or dialysis)  or abnormal  lab values,  imaging  may be 
indicated  if there  is a clinical  suspicion  for spine  infection  in a patient  with neck  or back  pain with or without fever.

Page Content: Clinically, it may be difficult  to differentiate  spine  infection  from  other  causes of neck  or back  pain such as 
degenerative disease,  trauma,  inflammatory  spondyloarthropathy,  or neoplastic involvement  of the spine  [3,35,55] . 
As any one of these clinical entities  has the potential to mimic  the imaging  appearance of spine  infection, it is 
important  to use the combination of clinical  presentation,  laboratory values such as an elevated  ESR and CRP  and 
imaging  findings  in order  to consider  the diagnosis  of spine  infection  [8]. 
The body regions  covered  in this clinical  scenario  are the cervical,  thoracic,  and lumbar  spine.  These body regions  
might  be evaluated  separately  or in combination as guided by physical  examination  findings,  patient  history, and 
other  available information.  
CT Spine  Area  of Interest  
As a result  of its excellent  delineation  of osseous detail  and greater  sensitivity  than radiography,  CT can be used in 
the evaluation  of spine  infection  [3]. The addition  of IV contrast  increases the conspicuity of paraspinal  soft tissue  
abnormalities, such as inflammation  or abscess  that may be caused  by infection. In those  cases  in which  a contrast -
enhanced  CT is to be performed,  it is not necessary  or useful  to perform  a noncontrast -enhanced  CT first, because  
this latter  examination  does not add more  diagnostic  information . The sensitivity  and specificity  of CT for spine  
infection  is 79% and 100%,  respectively  [33]. CT has low sensitivity  (6%)  for the identification  of epidural  abscess

Like other  spine  infections,  spinal  epidural  abscess has increased  in incidence and is now seen in 2.5 to 3/10,000  
patients  [3,60] . Epidural  abscess is often  associated  with diagnos tic delay  that can potentially  lead to significant  
neurologic  morbidity  and mortality.

(diabetes,  steroid  use) and patients  with an elevated  ESR, may be at increased  risk for epidural  abscess

Initial Imaging  Definition 
Initial imaging  is defined  as imaging  at the beginning of the care episode for the medical  condition defined  by the 
variant.  More  than one procedure  can be considered  usually  appropriate  in the initial imaging  evaluation  when : 
• There are procedures  that are equivalent  alternatives (ie, only one procedure  will be ordered  to 
provide  the clinical  information  to effectively  manage the patient’s  care)  
OR 
• There are complementary  procedures  (ie, more  than one procedure  is ordered  as a set or 
simultaneously  where each procedure  provides  unique  clinical  informatio n to effectively  manage  
the patient’s  care).  
Discussion  of Procedures  by Variant  
Variant  1: Suspected  spine infection (such  as epidural abscess or discitis  osteomyelitis),  with  new or 
worsening  back  or neck  pain, with  or without  fever,  who may have  one or more  of the following  red flags  
(diabetes  mellitus, IV drug  use, cancer,  HIV,  or dialysis)  or abnormal  lab values.  Initial imaging.  
The annual  incidence of spine  infection  ranges from  4 to 24 per million  per year [10]. In the presence of red flag 
conditions  (diabetes mellitus, IV drug use, cancer,  HIV,  or dialysis)  or abnormal  lab values,  imaging  may be 
indicated  if there  is a clinical  suspicion  for spine  infection  in a patient  with neck  or back  pain with or without fever.

Page Content: Clinically, it may be difficult  to differentiate  spine  infection  from  other  causes of neck  or back  pain such as 
degenerative disease,  trauma,  inflammatory  spondyloarthropathy,  or neoplastic involvement  of the spine  [3,35,55] . 
As any one of these clinical entities  has the potential to mimic  the imaging  appearance of spine  infection, it is 
important  to use the combination of clinical  presentation,  laboratory values such as an elevated  ESR and CRP  and 
imaging  findings  in order  to consider  the diagnosis  of spine  infection  [8]. 
The body regions  covered  in this clinical  scenario  are the cervical,  thoracic,  and lumbar  spine.  These body regions  
might  be evaluated  separately  or in combination as guided by physical  examination  findings,  patient  history, and 
other  available information.  
CT Spine  Area  of Interest  
As a result  of its excellent  delineation  of osseous detail  and greater  sensitivity  than radiography,  CT can be used in 
the evaluation  of spine  infection  [3]. The addition  of IV contrast  increases the conspicuity of paraspinal  soft tissue  
abnormalities, such as inflammation  or abscess  that may be caused  by infection. In those  cases  in which  a contrast -
enhanced  CT is to be performed,  it is not necessary  or useful  to perform  a noncontrast -enhanced  CT first, because  
this latter  examination  does not add more  diagnostic  information . The sensitivity  and specificity  of CT for spine  
infection  is 79% and 100%,  respectively  [33]. CT has low sensitivity  (6%)  for the identification  of epidural  abscess

Discussion  of Procedures  by Variant  
Variant  1: Suspected  spine infection (such  as epidural abscess or discitis  osteomyelitis),  with  new or 
worsening  back  or neck  pain, with  or without  fever,  who may have  one or more  of the following  red flags  
(diabetes  mellitus, IV drug  use, cancer,  HIV,  or dialysis)  or abnormal  lab values.  Initial imaging.  
The annual  incidence of spine  infection  ranges from  4 to 24 per million  per year [10]. In the presence of red flag 
conditions  (diabetes mellitus, IV drug use, cancer,  HIV,  or dialysis)  or abnormal  lab values,  imaging  may be 
indicated  if there  is a clinical  suspicion  for spine  infection  in a patient  with neck  or back  pain with or without fever.

Page Content: Clinically, it may be difficult  to differentiate  spine  infection  from  other  causes of neck  or back  pain such as 
degenerative disease,  trauma,  inflammatory  spondyloarthropathy,  or neoplastic involvement  of the spine  [3,35,55] . 
As any one of these clinical entities  has the potential to mimic  the imaging  appearance of spine  infection, it is 
important  to use the combination of clinical  presentation,  laboratory values such as an elevated  ESR and CRP  and 
imaging  findings  in order  to consider  the diagnosis  of spine  infection  [8]. 
The body regions  covered  in this clinical  scenario  are the cervical,  thoracic,  and lumbar  spine.  These body regions  
might  be evaluated  separately  or in combination as guided by physical  examination  findings,  patient  history, and 
other  available information.  
CT Spine  Area  of Interest  
As a result  of its excellent  delineation  of osseous detail  and greater  sensitivity  than radiography,  CT can be used in 
the evaluation  of spine  infection  [3]. The addition  of IV contrast  increases the conspicuity of paraspinal  soft tissue  
abnormalities, such as inflammation  or abscess  that may be caused  by infection. In those  cases  in which  a contrast -
enhanced  CT is to be performed,  it is not necessary  or useful  to perform  a noncontrast -enhanced  CT first, because  
this latter  examination  does not add more  diagnostic  information . The sensitivity  and specificity  of CT for spine  
infection  is 79% and 100%,  respectively  [33]. CT has low sensitivity  (6%)  for the identification  of epidural  abscess

Page Content: A retrospective,  case-control  study involving 10 patients  with tuberculous  spondylodiscitis  
(median  SUV max 12.4)  and 20 patients  with pyogenic  spondylodiscitis  (median  SUV max 7.3) revealed  significantly  
higher  SUV max levels in the patients  with tuberculous  spondylodiscitis,  but there was overlap  between  the two types  
of infection  [38]. However,  in another  retrospective study of 32 patients  with suspected  spondylodiscitis  who 
underwent  FDG -PET/CT,  imaging  at two time points  after the injection  of the radiotracer  (dual  time point  imaging)  
did not increase the diagnostic  utility  of the study nor were  SUV measurements able to distinguish  between  pyogenic  
and tuberculous spine  infection  [42]. 
Variant  2: Suspected  spine infection (such  as epidural abscess or discitis  osteomyelitis ), with  recent  
intervention (such  as surgery  with  or without  hardware,  pain injection, or stimulator  implantation). Initial 
imaging.  
The mean  incidence of postoperative  instrumented  spine  infection  is approximately 2% to 3% [40]. The diagnosis  
of postintervention  spine  infection  is a clinical  challenge given an overlap  of clinical  symptoms  such as neck  or 
back  pain between  postoperative  and spine  infection  patients.  The identification  of abnormal  laboratory parameters,  
such as leukocytosis  or elevated  ESR or CRP,  may increase the clinical  suspicion for spine  infection  in the 
postintervention patient  [8,9] .",True
