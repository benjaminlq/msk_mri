Relevant information from the patient profile includes the patient's age (68), symptoms (severe pain in the left hip, inability to bear weight on the left leg), the event that led to the symptoms (fall from stairs), and previous diagnosis (osteoporosis).

Noncontrast  and contrast -enhanced  MRI have overall  similar  diagnostic  utility  for evaluation  \nof the sacroiliac joints  and spine  in axSpA  [9,107-111,125 -129] .

Repeat  radiographs  can be obtained as necessary  for counseling  patients  on the status  \nand prognosis  of their disease,  although radiographs  are more  typically  performed  to evaluate the spine  rather  than \nthe sacroiliac  joints  [30].

Important  \nlaboratory parameters that may be assessed  include  serum  erythrocyte  sedimentation  rate (ESR),  C-reactive protein  \n(CRP),  white  blood  cell (WBC) count  with differential , and blood cultures [37,48-50] . Other  testing  such as for \nbrucella or mycobacterium  may be helpful  if the patient  is from  the appropriate  endemic  area [2,4,5,7] . Because the \nimaging  appearance of spine  infection  may overlap  with other  noninfectious  pathologic  entities, such as \ndegenerative disc disease,  inflammation, trauma , or neoplasm , spine  biopsy with microbiologic  and histopathologic  \nanalysis of the infected  tissue  is often  required  for diagnostic  confirmation  [35,51-58] . \nSpeci al Imaging  Consid erations \nAlthough  the clinical  presentation  and physical  examination  can help localize the level  of suspected  spine  infection, \nin specific clinical  situations  it may be beneficial  to image  the entire  spine  [21,59] .
