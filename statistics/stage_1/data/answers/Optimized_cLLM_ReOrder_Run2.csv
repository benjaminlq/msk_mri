For MRI lumbar spine without IV contrast to further assess low back pain. No prior imaging.  ",USUALLY APPROPRIATE,MRI lumbar spine without IV contrast,"1. Relevant information from the patient profile includes the patient's age (73 years old), symptoms (low back pain for 6 days), past medical history (cholecystectomy, fatty liver, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis of bilateral knees post bilateral total knee replacement), physical examination findings (mild step deformity at L2 region, full power in bilateral lower limbs, good anal tone), and the fact that this is the initial imaging for this episode of low back pain.

2. According to the context provided, for a patient with low back pain, initial imaging with MRI lumbar spine without IV contrast is usually appropriate in several scenarios, including a history of prior lumbar surgery, subacute or chronic low back pain with or without radiculopathy, low back pain with or without radiculopathy in the context of low-velocity trauma, osteoporosis, elderly individual, or chronic steroid use, and low back pain with or without radiculopathy with suspicion of cancer, infection, or immunosuppression. 

3. There are no superior imaging procedures or treatments with a more favorable risk-benefit ratio mentioned in the context for this patient's profile.

4. Based on the scoring criteria, the scan order of MRI lumbar spine without IV contrast is USUALLY APPROPRIATE for this patient. This is because the patient is an elderly individual with low back pain, and the scan order aligns with the recommendations given in the context.",UA,,,,,
"46 year old Caucasian female. For MRI whole spine without and with IV contrast to assess for myelopathy. History of systemic lupus erythematosus on follow up with rheumatology.  Now presenting with 5 day history of worsening numbness and tingling in all 4 limbs, feels uncoordinated and more difficult to control continence.   No prior imaging.  On examination, reduced pinprick sensation in bilateral hands and feets, power in all 4 limbs is 3 to 4 out of 5.  Anal tone is equivocally lax.  No sensory level.",USUALLY APPROPRIATE,MRI spine area of interest without and with IV contrast,"1. Relevant information from the patient profile includes:
   - Age: 46 years old
   - Symptoms: Acute onset of numbness and tingling in all 4 limbs, uncoordinated movements, difficulty controlling continence
   - Previous diagnosis: Systemic lupus erythematosus
   - Stage of diagnosis: Initial imaging for suspected myelopathy

2. According to the context provided, for acute onset myelopathy, an MRI of the spine area of interest without and with IV contrast is usually appropriate. This is because MRI has superior soft-tissue resolution and multiplanar capability, making it ideal for evaluation of the spinal canal and its contents as well as the surrounding osseous and soft-tissue structures. Inflammatory conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus can result in acute myelopathy.

3. There are no superior imaging procedures or treatments with a more favorable risk-benefit ratio mentioned in the context.

4. Based on the scoring criteria, the scan order of an MRI whole spine without and with IV contrast is USUALLY APPROPRIATE for this patient with acute onset myelopathy symptoms.",UA,,,,,
"Complains of lower back pain for the past 2 months with occasional night pain. MRI lumbar spine without and with IV contrast for possible spondylodiscitis. 73 year old Indian male, with history of end stage diabetic nephropathy on haemodialysis.  Associated with radicular pain of left lower limb. no fever. Physical exam reveals mild tenderness at L3-L4 region but otherwise unremarkable. No prior imaging. ",USUALLY APPROPRIATE,MRI lumbar spine without IV contrast,"1. Relevant information from the patient profile includes:
   - Age: 73 years old
   - Symptoms: Lower back pain for the past 2 months with occasional night pain, radicular pain of left lower limb
   - Previous Diagnosis: End stage diabetic nephropathy on haemodialysis
   - Stage of Diagnosis: Initial imaging
   - Other relevant information: No fever, mild tenderness at L3-L4 region

2. Referring to the reference information given under CONTEXT, the patient's profile aligns with the description of ""Low back pain with or without radiculopathy. One or more of the following: suspicion of cancer, infection, or immunosuppression. Initial imaging."" due to the patient's immunosuppressed state from end stage diabetic nephropathy on haemodialysis and the suspicion of infection (spondylodiscitis).

3. According to the table under this description, the ordered scan ""MRI lumbar spine without and with IV contrast"" is usually appropriate. However, considering the patient's end stage renal disease, the use of IV contrast may pose a risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Therefore, a scan without IV contrast may be a safer option.

4. Based on the SCORING CRITERIA, the ordered scan ""MRI lumbar spine without and with IV contrast"" is USUALLY APPROPRIATE for the patient's condition. However, due to the patient's specific risk factors (end stage renal disease), a scan without IV contrast would be more appropriate. Therefore, I would recommend an ""MRI lumbar spine without IV contrast"" instead.",UNA,,,,,
"Clinical exam reveals mild midline tenderness over the cervical spine with limited range of motion, but no focal neurological deficit. MRI cervical spine without IV contrast for initial examination. 70 year old Malay male. History of diabetes, hyperlipidemia and hypertension. Worsening neck pain for past 6 months, no radiculopathy or night pain. No recent trauma. ",MAY BE APPROPRIATE,Radiography cervical spine,"1. Relevant information from the patient profile includes: 
   - Age: 70 years old
   - Symptoms: Worsening neck pain for the past 6 months, no radiculopathy or night pain
   - Previous diagnosis: Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension
   - Stage of diagnosis: Initial imaging
   - Other relevant information: No recent trauma, mild midline tenderness over the cervical spine with limited range of motion, but no focal neurological deficit.

2. Referring to the context information, the patient's condition aligns with the description of ""Chronic cervical or neck pain. Initial imaging."" 

3. According to the reference information, for chronic cervical or neck pain, the following imaging procedures are recommended:
   - Radiography cervical spine: Usually Appropriate
   - MRI cervical spine without IV contrast: May Be Appropriate (Disagreement)
   - CT cervical spine without IV contrast: Usually Not Appropriate

4. Based on the scoring criteria, the ordered scan, MRI cervical spine without IV contrast, is classified as ""May Be Appropriate"" for this patient's condition. This means that the imaging procedure may be indicated in this clinical scenario as an alternative to imaging procedures with a more favorable risk-benefit ratio, or the risk-benefit ratio for patients is equivocal. 

However, considering the patient's age and chronic condition, a Radiography cervical spine, which is classified as ""Usually Appropriate"", might be a more suitable initial imaging study due to its lower cost, less complexity, and less time-consuming nature.",MBA,,,,,
" No prior imaging. MRI of the left wrist without and with IV contrast for possible septic arthritis. 60 year old Chinese female. No past medical history.  Left wrist swelling and redness for 1 week. No trauma.  No fever. On examination, left wrist is warm swollen and tender.",USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE,"Aspiration of the wrist followed by analysis of the aspirate. If further imaging is needed after the aspiration, an MRI with IV contrast may be considered.","1. Relevant information from the patient profile includes: 
   - Age: 60 years old
   - Symptoms: Left wrist swelling and redness for 1 week, no trauma, no fever, wrist is warm, swollen, and tender
   - Previous diagnosis: None
   - Stage of diagnosis: Initial imaging

2. According to the reference information given under the context, the patient's symptoms suggest a possible infection in the wrist. The context suggests that in cases of suspected septic arthritis, percutaneous aspiration of the wrist is indicated, even when radiographs appear normal. Aspirates should be analyzed by cell count, gram stain, and appropriate cultures. Microscopic crystal analysis should also be obtained if there is a possibility of gout, acute pseudogout, or hydroxyapatite deposition disease. Aspiration can be performed without imaging guidance if the joint is distended, but either fluoroscopy or US may be useful if a specific compartment is to be targeted. 

3. The context suggests that there may be a role for MRI with IV contrast enhancement in the staging of infections (for example, to delineate the location and extent of soft-tissue abscesses) after aspiration has been performed. Especially in chronic cases, MRI with IV contrast may be useful to identify a fluid collection or joint effusion to target for aspiration. However, MRI is usually not appropriate as the next study after radiographs for suspected wrist infections.

4. Based on the scoring criteria, the scan order of MRI of the left wrist without and with IV contrast for possible septic arthritis is USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE. The appropriate procedure would be to perform an aspiration of the wrist first, followed by analysis of the aspirate. If further imaging is needed after the aspiration, an MRI with IV contrast may be considered.",UNA,X-ray left wrist,,,,
