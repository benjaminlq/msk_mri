This is also the case for chronic or progressive myelopathy. The patient's symptoms suggest an acute onset of myelopathy, and the patient has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus, which is mentioned as a systemic inflammatory condition that can result in acute myelopathy.

3. There are no superior imaging procedures or treatments with a more favorable risk-benefit ratio mentioned in the context.

4. Based on the scoring criteria, the scan order for an MRI of the whole spine without and with IV contrast is USUALLY APPROPRIATE for this patient. This imaging procedure is indicated in the specified clinical scenario (acute onset myelopathy) at a favorable risk-benefit ratio for patients.",UA,,,,,
"73 year old Indian male, with history of end stage diabetic nephropathy on haemodialysis. Complains of lower back pain for the past 2 months with occasional night pain. Associated with radicular pain of left lower limb. no fever. Physical exam reveals mild tenderness at L3-L4 region but otherwise unremarkable. No prior imaging. MRI lumbar spine without and with IV contrast for possible spondylodiscitis.",USUALLY APPROPRIATE,MRI lumbar spine without IV contrast,"1. Relevant information from the patient profile includes:
   - Age: 73 years old
   - Symptoms: Lower back pain for the past 2 months with occasional night pain, radicular pain of left lower limb
   - Previous Diagnosis: End stage diabetic nephropathy on haemodialysis
   - Stage of Diagnosis: Initial imaging, no prior imaging has been done
   - Other relevant information: Mild tenderness at L3-L4 region, no fever

2. Referring to the context, the patient's profile aligns with the description of ""Low back pain with or without radiculopathy. One or more of the following: suspicion of cancer, infection, or immunosuppression. Initial imaging."" This is due to the patient's history of end stage diabetic nephropathy on haemodialysis, which can lead to immunosuppression, and the suspicion of spondylodiscitis, which is an infection.

3. According to the context, the following imaging procedures are recommended for this patient's condition:
   - MRI lumbar spine without and with IV contrast: Usually Appropriate
   - MRI lumbar spine without IV contrast: Usually Appropriate
   - Radiography lumbar spine: May Be Appropriate (Disagreement)
   - CT lumbar spine with IV contrast: May Be Appropriate
   - CT lumbar spine without IV contrast: May Be Appropriate
   - CT myelography lumbar spine: May Be Appropriate

4. Based on the scoring criteria, the ordered scan of ""MRI lumbar spine without and with IV contrast"" is USUALLY APPROPRIATE for this patient. However, considering the patient's history of end stage diabetic nephropathy on haemodialysis, the use of IV contrast may pose a risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Therefore, an MRI lumbar spine without IV contrast could be a safer alternative with a more favorable risk-benefit ratio.",UNA,,,,,
"70 year old Malay male. History of diabetes, hyperlipidemia and hypertension. Worsening neck pain for past 6 months, no radiculopathy or night pain. No recent trauma. Clinical exam reveals mild midline tenderness over the cervical spine with limited range of motion, but no focal neurological deficit. MRI cervical spine without IV contrast for initial examination. ",MAY BE APPROPRIATE,Radiography cervical spine,"1. Relevant information from the patient profile includes: 
   - Age: 70 years old
   - Symptoms: Worsening neck pain for the past 6 months, no radiculopathy or night pain
   - Previous diagnosis: Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension
   - Stage of diagnosis: Initial imaging
   - Other relevant information: No recent trauma, mild midline tenderness over the cervical spine with limited range of motion, but no focal neurological deficit

2. According to the context provided, for chronic cervical or neck pain without radiculopathy, the following imaging recommendations are given:
   - MRI cervical spine without IV contrast is considered ""May Be Appropriate (Disagreement)"" for initial imaging.
   - Radiography cervical spine is considered ""Usually Appropriate"" for initial imaging.

3. Based on the context, there are no superior imaging procedures or treatments with a more favorable risk-benefit ratio mentioned for this specific patient profile.

4. Based on the scoring criteria, the scan order of MRI cervical spine without IV contrast for initial examination is ""May Be Appropriate"". This means that the imaging procedure may be indicated in this clinical scenario as an alternative to imaging procedures or treatments with a more favorable risk-benefit ratio, or the risk-benefit ratio for patients is equivocal. However, radiography cervical spine, which is considered ""Usually Appropriate"", could be a more suitable initial imaging procedure for this patient.",MBA,,,,,
"60 year old Chinese female. No past medical history.  Left wrist swelling and redness for 1 week. No trauma.  No fever. On examination, left wrist is warm swollen and tender.  No prior imaging. MRI of the left wrist without and with IV contrast for possible septic arthritis.",USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE,"Aspiration of the wrist, followed by analysis of the aspirate. If further imaging is needed after the aspiration, an MRI with IV contrast could be considered.","1. Relevant information from the patient profile includes: 
   - Age: 60 years old
   - Symptoms: Left wrist swelling and redness for 1 week, no trauma, no fever, wrist is warm, swollen, and tender
   - Previous diagnosis: None
   - Stage of diagnosis: Initial imaging

2. According to the reference information, the patient's symptoms suggest a possible infection in the wrist. The context suggests that in cases of suspected septic arthritis, percutaneous aspiration of the wrist is indicated, even when radiographs appear normal. Aspirates should be analyzed by cell count, gram stain, and appropriate cultures. Microscopic crystal analysis should also be obtained if there is a possibility of gout, acute pseudogout, or hydroxyapatite deposition disease. Aspiration can be performed without imaging guidance if the joint is distended, but either fluoroscopy or US may be useful if a specific compartment is to be targeted. 

3. The context suggests that there may be a role for MRI with IV contrast enhancement in the staging of infections (for example, to delineate the location and extent of soft-tissue abscesses) after aspiration has been performed. Especially in chronic cases, MRI with IV contrast may be useful to identify a fluid collection or joint effusion to target for aspiration. However, MRI is usually not appropriate as the next study after radiographs for suspected wrist infections. 

4. Based on the scoring criteria, the scan order of MRI of the left wrist without and with IV contrasts is USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE for this patient at this stage. The appropriate procedure would be to perform an aspiration of the wrist, followed by analysis of the aspirate. If further imaging is needed after the aspiration, an MRI with IV contrast could be considered.",UNA,X-ray left wrist,,,,
