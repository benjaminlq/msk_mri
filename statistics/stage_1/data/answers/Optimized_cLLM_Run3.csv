Contrast-enhanced imaging is recommended for initial diagnostic evaluation.

3. There are no superior imaging procedures or treatments with a more favorable risk-benefit ratio mentioned in the context.

4. Based on the scoring criteria, the scan order for an MRI of the whole spine without and with IV contrast is USUALLY APPROPRIATE for this patient presenting with symptoms of myelopathy.",UA,,,,,
"73 year old Indian male, with history of end stage diabetic nephropathy on haemodialysis. Complains of lower back pain for the past 2 months with occasional night pain. Associated with radicular pain of left lower limb. no fever. Physical exam reveals mild tenderness at L3-L4 region but otherwise unremarkable. No prior imaging. MRI lumbar spine without and with IV contrast for possible spondylodiscitis.",USUALLY APPROPRIATE,MRI lumbar spine without IV contrast,"1. Relevant information from the patient profile includes:
   - Age: 73 years old
   - Symptoms: Lower back pain for the past 2 months with occasional night pain, associated with radicular pain of left lower limb
   - Previous Diagnosis: End stage diabetic nephropathy on haemodialysis
   - Stage of Diagnosis: Initial imaging, no prior imaging has been done
   - Other relevant information: The patient is immunosuppressed due to end-stage diabetic nephropathy and is on haemodialysis. There is a suspicion of spondylodiscitis.

2. Referring to the context, the patient's profile fits the description of ""Low back pain with or without radiculopathy. One or more of the following: suspicion of cancer, infection, or immunosuppression. Initial imaging."" The patient is immunosuppressed and there is a suspicion of infection (spondylodiscitis).

3. According to the reference information, the following imaging procedures are recommended for this patient's condition:
   - MRI lumbar spine without and with IV contrast: Usually Appropriate
   - MRI lumbar spine without IV contrast: Usually Appropriate
   - Radiography lumbar spine: May Be Appropriate (Disagreement)
   - CT lumbar spine with IV contrast: May Be Appropriate
   - CT lumbar spine without IV contrast: May Be Appropriate
   - CT myelography lumbar spine: May Be Appropriate

4. The ordered scan, MRI lumbar spine without and with IV contrast, is classified as ""Usually Appropriate"" for this patient's condition. However, considering the patient's history of end-stage diabetic nephropathy and being on haemodialysis, the use of IV contrast may pose a risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Therefore, an MRI lumbar spine without IV contrast, which is also classified as ""Usually Appropriate"", may be a safer alternative with a more favorable risk-benefit ratio. 

Based on the scoring criteria, the ordered scan is USUALLY APPROPRIATE, but an MRI lumbar spine without IV contrast may be a safer alternative considering the patient's renal condition.",UNA,,,,,
"70 year old Malay male. History of diabetes, hyperlipidemia and hypertension. Worsening neck pain for past 6 months, no radiculopathy or night pain. No recent trauma. Clinical exam reveals mild midline tenderness over the cervical spine with limited range of motion, but no focal neurological deficit. MRI cervical spine without IV contrast for initial examination. ",MAY BE APPROPRIATE,MRI cervical spine without IV contrast,"1. Relevant information from the patient profile includes: 
   - Age: 70 years old
   - Symptoms: Worsening neck pain for the past 6 months, no radiculopathy or night pain
   - Previous diagnosis: Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension
   - Stage of diagnosis: Initial imaging
   - Other relevant information: No recent trauma, mild midline tenderness over the cervical spine with limited range of motion, but no focal neurological deficit

2. According to the context provided, for chronic cervical or neck pain without radiculopathy, the following imaging recommendations are given:
   - Radiography cervical spine: Usually Appropriate
   - MRI cervical spine without IV contrast: May Be Appropriate (Disagreement)
   - CT cervical spine without IV contrast: Usually Not Appropriate

3. There are no superior imaging procedures or treatments with a more favorable risk-benefit ratio mentioned in the context.

4. Based on the scoring criteria, the scan order of MRI cervical spine without IV contrast for initial examination is MAY BE APPROPRIATE. This is because the patient has chronic neck pain without radiculopathy, and the context suggests that MRI cervical spine without IV contrast may be appropriate, although there is disagreement. Radiography cervical spine could also be considered as it is usually appropriate in this scenario.",MBA,,,,,
"60 year old Chinese female. No past medical history.  Left wrist swelling and redness for 1 week. No trauma.  No fever. On examination, left wrist is warm swollen and tender.  No prior imaging. MRI of the left wrist without and with IV contrast for possible septic arthritis.",USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE,"Aspiration of the wrist, followed by MRI with IV contrast if necessary","1. Relevant information from the patient profile includes: 
   - Age: 60 years old
   - Symptoms: Left wrist swelling and redness for 1 week, no trauma, no fever, wrist is warm, swollen, and tender
   - Previous diagnosis: None
   - Stage of diagnosis: Initial imaging

2. According to the reference information given under the context, the patient's symptoms suggest a possible infection in the wrist. The context suggests that in cases of suspected septic arthritis, joint aspiration should not be delayed in order to obtain advanced imaging studies. Aspiration can be performed without imaging guidance if the joint is distended, but either fluoroscopy or US may be useful if a specific compartment is to be targeted. There may be a role for MRI with IV contrast enhancement in the staging of infections (for example, to delineate the location and extent of soft-tissue abscesses) after aspiration has been performed. However, MRI is usually not appropriate as the next study after radiographs for suspected wrist infections.

3. Based on the context, a superior imaging procedure would be to perform an aspiration of the wrist, which is usually appropriate in cases of suspected infection. This can be followed by an MRI with IV contrast if necessary to stage the infection.

4. Based on the scoring criteria, the scan order of an MRI of the left wrist without and with IV contrasts is USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE as the initial imaging study in this case. The recommended procedure would be to perform an aspiration of the wrist, followed by an MRI with IV contrast if necessary.",UNA,X-ray left wrist,,,,
