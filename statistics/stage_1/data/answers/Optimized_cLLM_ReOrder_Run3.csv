4. Based on the scoring criteria, the scan order of an MRI whole spine without and with IV contrast to assess for myelopathy is USUALLY APPROPRIATE. This is because the patient's symptoms suggest possible myelopathy, and the ordered scan is indicated in this clinical scenario with a favorable risk-benefit ratio.",UA,,,,,
"Complains of lower back pain for the past 2 months with occasional night pain. MRI lumbar spine without and with IV contrast for possible spondylodiscitis. 73 year old Indian male, with history of end stage diabetic nephropathy on haemodialysis.  Associated with radicular pain of left lower limb. no fever. Physical exam reveals mild tenderness at L3-L4 region but otherwise unremarkable. No prior imaging. ",USUALLY APPROPRIATE,MRI spine without IV contrast,"1. Relevant information from the patient profile includes: 
- Age: 73 years old
- Symptoms: Lower back pain for the past 2 months with occasional night pain, radicular pain of left lower limb
- Previous Diagnosis: End stage diabetic nephropathy on haemodialysis
- Stage of Diagnosis: Initial imaging

2. Referring to the context, the patient's profile aligns with the description of ""Low back pain with or without radiculopathy. One or more of the following: suspicion of cancer, infection, or immunosuppression. Initial imaging."" due to the patient's immunosuppressed state from end stage diabetic nephropathy on haemodialysis and the suspicion of spondylodiscitis (infection).

3. According to the reference information, the ordered scan ""MRI lumbar spine without and with IV contrast"" is usually appropriate for this patient's condition. However, considering the patient's end stage renal disease, the use of IV contrast may pose a risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Therefore, an MRI without IV contrast would be a superior imaging procedure with a more favorable risk-benefit ratio.

4. Based on the scoring criteria, the ordered scan ""MRI lumbar spine without and with IV contrast"" is USUALLY APPROPRIATE for the patient's condition. However, due to the patient's specific risk factors (end stage renal disease), an MRI without IV contrast would be more appropriate.",UNA,,,,,
"Clinical exam reveals mild midline tenderness over the cervical spine with limited range of motion, but no focal neurological deficit. MRI cervical spine without IV contrast for initial examination. 70 year old Malay male. History of diabetes, hyperlipidemia and hypertension. Worsening neck pain for past 6 months, no radiculopathy or night pain. No recent trauma. ",MAY BE APPROPRIATE,Radiography cervical spine,"1. Relevant information from the patient profile includes: 
   - Age: 70 years old
   - Symptoms: Worsening neck pain for the past 6 months, no radiculopathy or night pain
   - Previous diagnosis: Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension
   - Stage of diagnosis: Initial imaging
   - Other relevant information: No recent trauma, mild midline tenderness over the cervical spine with limited range of motion, but no focal neurological deficit.

2. Referring to the context information, the patient's condition aligns with the description of ""Chronic cervical or neck pain. Initial imaging."" 

3. According to the context, for initial imaging of chronic cervical or neck pain, the following imaging procedures are recommended:
   - Radiography cervical spine: Usually Appropriate
   - MRI cervical spine without IV contrast: May Be Appropriate (Disagreement)
   - CT cervical spine without IV contrast: Usually Not Appropriate

4. Based on the scoring criteria, the ordered scan, MRI cervical spine without IV contrast, is classified as ""May Be Appropriate"" for this patient's condition. This means that the imaging procedure may be indicated in this clinical scenario as an alternative to imaging procedures with a more favorable risk-benefit ratio, or the risk-benefit ratio for patients is equivocal. However, Radiography cervical spine, which is classified as ""Usually Appropriate"", might be a superior imaging procedure with a more favorable risk-benefit ratio.",MBA,,,,,
" No prior imaging. MRI of the left wrist without and with IV contrast for possible septic arthritis. 60 year old Chinese female. No past medical history.  Left wrist swelling and redness for 1 week. No trauma.  No fever. On examination, left wrist is warm swollen and tender.",USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE,"Radiography of the wrist, followed by aspiration if infection is suspected.","1. Relevant information from the patient profile includes: 
   - Age: 60 years old
   - Symptoms: Left wrist swelling and redness for 1 week, no trauma, no fever, wrist is warm, swollen, and tender
   - Previous diagnosis: None
   - Stage of diagnosis: Initial imaging

2. According to the reference information, for chronic wrist pain with or without prior injury, the best initial study is radiography. In cases where infection is suspected, aspiration of the wrist is usually appropriate. MRI with IV contrast may be useful in staging infections after aspiration has been performed, especially in chronic cases, to identify a fluid collection or joint effusion to target for aspiration. However, MRI is usually not appropriate as the next study after radiographs for suspected wrist infections.

3. Based on the patient's symptoms and the reference information, a more appropriate initial imaging procedure would be radiography of the wrist. If infection is suspected, aspiration of the wrist should be performed. 

4. Based on the scoring criteria, the scan order of MRI of the left wrist without and with IV contrast for possible septic arthritis is USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE as the initial imaging study in this case. The recommended procedure would be radiography of the wrist, followed by aspiration if infection is suspected.",UNA,X-ray left wrist,,,,
