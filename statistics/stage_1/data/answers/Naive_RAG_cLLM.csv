   - Age: 46 years old
   - Symptoms: Severe pain at right big toe for 2 weeks, swelling and erythema at right big toe 1st metatarsophalangeal joint
   - Previous diagnosis: Fatty liver, acute cholecystitis post cholecystectomy
   - Stage of diagnosis: Initial imaging

2. The context information suggests that for chronic foot pain, radiography is usually the first imaging study performed. Ultrasound (US) is usually not indicated as the first imaging study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain, but may be performed when there is a high clinical suspicion of pathologic conditions. For suspected gout, US has been shown to outperform clinical assessment and radiography in the detection of erosions. There is evidence that US may have higher sensitivity for detection of gout compared with DECT in early gout (duration <1 year).

3. Based on the scoring criteria, the ordered MRI forefoot with and without IV contrast for evaluation of gout is USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE as the initial imaging study for this patient. The appropriate initial imaging study would be a radiography of the foot. If the radiography is inconclusive and there is a high clinical suspicion of gout, an ultrasound could be considered as the next imaging study.",UNA,X-ray right foot,1,1,OK,

X-rays show degenerative changes in bilateral hand interphalangeal joints with equivocal gull-wing deformity.  MRI of bilateral hands with and without IV contrast to assess for erosive osteoarthritis. ",MAY BE APPROPRIATE,MRI,"1. Relevant information from the patient profile:
- Age: 55 years old
- Symptoms: Bilateral finger joint pain, swelling, and stiffness worse in the morning for 4 months, worsening recently
- Previous Diagnosis: Degenerative changes in bilateral hand interphalangeal joints with equivocal gull-wing deformity
- Stage of Diagnosis: Next imaging study after inconclusive X-rays

2. Reference to the context information:
The patient's symptoms and X-ray findings suggest a suspicion of erosive osteoarthritis. According to the context, the next imaging study after inconclusive X-rays for chronic extremity joint pain with suspicion of erosive osteoarthritis is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that MRI can be used to improve the certainty of diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) above clinical criteria as well as to detect early joint damage before it is radiographically visible. 

3. Appropriateness of the scan order:
Based on the scoring criteria, the order for an MRI of bilateral hands with and without IV contrast to assess for erosive osteoarthritis can be considered as MAY BE APPROPRIATE. This is because, while the context does not explicitly recommend MRI for erosive osteoarthritis, it does mention the utility of MRI in detecting early joint damage and improving diagnostic certainty in cases of arthritis. Therefore, given the patient's symptoms and inconclusive X-ray findings, an MRI could potentially provide useful information. However, it's important to note that the risk-benefit ratio for the patient is equivocal, and other imaging procedures or treatments with a more favorable risk-benefit ratio may be available.",MBA,,1,1,OK,

   - Stage of diagnosis: Initial imaging
   - Physical examination: Tenderness over metatarsal head/neck regions

2. According to the reference information, conventional radiography is usually the first imaging study in evaluating patients with chronic foot pain. Radiographs are usually performed initially in the clinical setting of a suspected stress fracture. A systematic review reported sensitivities ranging from 12% to 56% and specificities ranging from 88% to 96% for radiographs in the detection of lower-extremity stress fractures. MRI is not typically the first imaging study in the evaluation of chronic foot pain.

3. Based on the scoring criteria, the ordered MRI scan is USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE as the initial imaging study for this patient's chronic foot pain.

- Previous Diagnosis: Fibroids, endometriosis, gestational diabetes, bilateral breast fibroadenomas
- Stage of diagnosis: Next study (X-rays have been performed and showed no significant abnormality)

2. Reference information from the context:
- MRI allows accurate characterization of the plantar fascia and adjacent soft tissues and bones, and several imaging findings have been described in patients with plantar fasciitis and partial or complete tears of the plantar fascia on MRI. MRI is currently considered the most sensitive imaging study in the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis. There is no relevant literature supporting the routine use of contrast in the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis or tears.
- Radiography foot is usually appropriate for the initial imaging of chronic foot pain of unknown etiology. In this case, radiographs have been performed and showed no significant abnormality.
- Though radiography is typically insensitive in the diagnosis of fasciitis, it should be the initial imaging study in patients with a painful heel. The combination of thickened plantar fascia and fat pad abnormalities on radiographs has a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis.

3. Based on the scoring criteria, the scan ordered (MRI bilateral feet without IV contrast) is USUALLY APPROPRIATE. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest plantar fasciitis, and the MRI is the most sensitive imaging study for this condition.

- Stage of Diagnosis: Next study

2. Reference information from the context:
- For ulnar-sided chronic wrist pain with normal or nonspecific radiographs, MRI without IV contrast or an MR arthrogram of the wrist is usually appropriate.
- MRI is highly accurate for lesions involving the radial (central) zone of the disc, especially with the use of high-resolution fast spin-echo or 3-D gradient-recalled pulse sequences. The sensitivity for tears of the ulnar attachment of the disc and the peripheral attachments (the ulnocarpal ligaments) are only fair with noncontrast-enhanced wrist MRI.

2. Reference information from the context:
- MRI has been shown to be highly reproducible in the detection, localization, quantification, and characterization of fluid collections in patients suspected of having infection.
- MRI can distinguish patients with infection from those with loosening using features such as soft tissue edema, abnormalities at both acetabular and femoral components, and enlarged lymph nodes.
- Intraarticular anesthetic has been used to evaluate painful total hip arthroplasties (THAs), primarily to differentiate referred pain (especially from the spine) from pain originating in the hip.
- There is no relevant literature to support the use of MRI of the hip in the initial evaluation of chronic hip pain.

3. Based on the scoring criteria, the scan ordered (MRI left hip without IV contrast) is MAY BE APPROPRIATE. Although the context suggests that there is no relevant literature to support the use of MRI in the initial evaluation of chronic hip pain, the patient's symptoms and previous diagnosis of total hip replacement suggest that the MRI could be useful in identifying potential complications such as infection or loosening of the prosthesis.

- Stage of diagnosis: Next study (after X-rays)

2. Reference information from the context:
- Periprosthetic fractures may occur either during or after surgery and can involve the femur, tibia, or patella. Supracondylar fractures occur in 0.3% to 2.5% of TKA, usually within 2 to 4 years after surgery, and often occur in the setting of low-energy trauma.
- Most patients with periprosthetic fractures are elderly, having poor bone stock.
- X-rays are the initial imaging modality but may not show all fractures, especially if they are radiographically occult.

3. Based on the scoring criteria, the scan order of an MRI of the left knee without IV contrast to assess for radiographically occult periprosthetic fracture is USUALLY APPROPRIATE.

2. Reference information from the context:
   - MRI is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for adults with suspected wrist tendon or ligament trauma and when radiographs show acute wrist fracture.
   - MRI is ideal for evaluating tendon injuries and helping with surgical planning.
   - MRI is commonly used for the diagnosis of Stener lesions of the thumb and the diagnosis of pulley system injuries.

3. Based on the scoring criteria:
   - If this is the initial imaging for the patient, it may not be the most appropriate choice. Radiographs are usually appropriate for the initial imaging of adults with acute blunt or penetrating trauma to the hand or wrist.
   - If the patient has already had initial imaging (like radiographs) that were negative or equivocal, then an MRI may be appropriate as the next imaging study.
   - If the patient has had a radiograph that shows an acute wrist fracture, then an MRI is usually appropriate as the next imaging study for adults with suspected wrist tendon or ligament trauma.

   - Symptoms: Not specified
   - Previous Diagnosis: Not specified
   - Stage of Diagnosis: Not specified, but the scan order suggests a suspicion of pathological vertebral compression fracture.

2. According to the reference information:
   - MRI lumbar spine without IV contrast is useful in determining the acuity of a vertebral fracture and in demonstrating spinal canal compromise.
   - MRI of the spine with and without IV contrast may be useful to assess for inflammation but should be carefully assessed because it is prone to artifactual distortion.
   - MRI lumbar spine with IV contrast is not typically performed independently as an initial study, as its interpretation is most informative when correlated with standard noncontrast sequences included in MRI lumbar spine with and without IV contrast.
   - When an asymptomatic VCF is identified on radiographs and there is a history of malignancy, both CT of the spine without IV contrast, or MRI of the spine either without or with and without IV contrast is recommended as the next imaging study to evaluate for bone marrow edema, enhancing tumor, or other complication.

2. Reference to the context information:
- The patient has a traumatic shoulder injury with a confirmed fracture. According to the ACR Appropriateness Criteria, MRI is a reasonable imaging study in the setting of acute nonlocalized traumatic shoulder pain and noncontributory radiographs. However, in this case, the radiographs were contributory as they confirmed a fracture.
- The context also mentions that US is not reliable in characterizing fracture patterns and is significantly limited by decreased patient mobility and swelling, which are present in this patient.
- CT is better able to characterize fracture patterns than radiographs, which could be beneficial in this case as the patient has a comminuted fracture.

3. Based on the scoring criteria:
- The ordered MRI scan may be appropriate. While it can provide valuable information about soft tissue injuries, it may not be the best choice for characterizing the fracture pattern in this patient. A CT scan might be more appropriate for this purpose.

2. Reference to the context information:
- The patient presents with a superficial soft tissue mass, which is a lump on the right thigh. According to the ACR Appropriateness Criteria, initial imaging assessment of a suspected musculoskeletal soft tissue mass should almost invariably begin with radiographic evaluation. 
- The document also mentions that urgent imaging requests should be sought for masses that are >5 cm in diameter, deep in location, or have shown rapid growth. The patient's lump does not meet these criteria.
- The document also states that the use of US for the final evaluation and staging of a deep soft tissue mass is not recommended. However, the patient's lump is superficial, not deep.
- The document also mentions that MRI is not the first line of imaging for a soft tissue mass. It is usually used when radiographs and/or noncontrast US have been performed but did not sufficiently characterize a soft tissue mass.

2. Reference information from the context:
- The context does not provide specific information about the use of MRI for the evaluation of a foot lump with calcifications. However, MRI is generally a useful tool for the evaluation of soft tissue masses and could potentially provide more information about the nature of the lump, including its exact location, size, and any involvement of surrounding structures.

3. Appropriateness of the scan order:
- Based on the information available, the order for an MRI of the mid-forefoot without IV contrast seems to be USUALLY APPROPRIATE. The patient has a lump that is increasing in size, and while initial imaging has not shown a destructive bone lesion, the presence of calcifications and the mildly irregular margins seen on ultrasound suggest that further evaluation is needed.

- Age: 41 years old
- Symptoms: Power in bilateral lower limbs is 2 out of 5, slightly lax anal tone
- Previous diagnosis: T12 chance fracture from a road traffic accident
- Stage of diagnosis: Next study, after initial X-rays

2. Reference to the context information:
- The patient has been involved in a high-energy mechanism of injury (road traffic accident) and presents with a neurologic deficit (reduced power in lower limbs and lax anal tone), which are criteria for imaging of the thoracolumbar spine.
- The patient has a confirmed thoracolumbar spine injury (T12 chance fracture) detected on initial imaging (X-rays).
- According to the ACR Appropriateness Criteria, MRI should be performed in patients who have possible spinal cord injury, in whom there is clinical concern for cord compression that is due to disc protrusion or hematoma, and in those suspected of ligamentous instability. MRI is valuable for characterizing the cause of myelopathy in patients with spinal cord injury.

   - Symptoms: Low back pain for 3 days post cricket match, positive straight leg raise test
   - Previous diagnosis: Fatty liver, hyperlipidemia on statins
   - Stage of diagnosis: Initial imaging (no prior imaging)

2. According to the reference information:
   - MRI lumbar spine with IV contrast is not typically performed independently as an initial study, as its interpretation is most informative when correlated with standard noncontrast sequences included in MRI lumbar spine with and without IV contrast.
   - Patients presenting with subacute or chronic LBP or radiculopathy who have failed 6 weeks of conservative therapy, and with physical examination signs of nerve root irritation, should be imaged if they are believed to be candidates for surgery or intervention or if diagnostic uncertainty remains.
   - There is no statistically significant difference in primary outcome after 1 year for patients aged 65 years or older who had spine imaging within 6 weeks after an initial visit for care for LBP versus similar patients who did not undergo early imaging.
   - Patients with new episodes of LBP and previous MRI scans are unlikely to detect changes in disc protrusion, annular fissures, high-intensity zones, or end-plate signal changes with repeated MRI.

3. Based on the scoring criteria, the scan order for MRI lumbar spine with IV contrast is USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE. The patient has only had symptoms for 3 days and has not yet undergone conservative therapy. The patient's symptoms do not indicate a need for immediate imaging.

- Age: 70 years old
- Symptoms: Worsening neck pain for the past 6 months, no radiculopathy or night pain
- Previous diagnosis: Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension
- Stage of diagnosis: Initial imaging

2. Reference information from the context:
- In patients with neck pain without neurologic symptoms, the relevance of specific MRI findings in the cervical spine should be considered in light of expected changes associated with aging. 
- MRI is more sensitive than CT in identifying degenerative cervical disorders. However, the presence of degenerative changes should be interpreted with caution. 
- Spondylotic changes on radiographs and MRI are common in patients over 30 years of age and have been shown to correlate poorly with the presence of neck pain.
- In absence of red flag symptoms, imaging may not be required at the time of initial presentation as spondylotic changes are commonly identified on radiographs and MRI in patients >30 years of age and correlate poorly with the presence of neck pain.

3. Based on the scoring criteria and the patient's profile, the ordered MRI cervical spine without IV contrast for initial examination is MAY BE APPROPRIATE. The patient does not have red flag symptoms that would necessitate immediate imaging, and the MRI may identify degenerative changes that are common in patients of this age. However, these changes may not correlate with the patient's neck pain, so the usefulness of the MRI is equivocal.",MBA,,1,1,OK,

2. According to the context information:
   - Aspiration of the wrist is indicated in cases of suspected septic arthritis, even when radiographs appear normal. This should not be delayed to obtain advanced imaging studies.
   - MRI with IV contrast enhancement may have a role in the staging of infections (for example, to delineate the location and extent of soft-tissue abscesses) after aspiration has been performed. Especially in chronic cases, MRI with IV contrast may be useful to identify a fluid collection or joint effusion to target for aspiration. However, MRI is usually not appropriate as the next study after radiographs for suspected wrist infections.
   - While CT with IV contrast enhancement can depict abscesses, it is usually not appropriate for evaluation of suspected wrist infections.
   - There may be a role for US in the staging of infections (for example, to delineate the location and extent of soft-tissue abscesses) after aspiration has been performed.
