"46 year old Caucasian female.  History of systemic lupus erythematosus on follow up with rheumatology.  Now presenting with 5 day history of worsening numbness and tingling in all 4 limbs, feels uncoordinated and more difficult to control continence.  On examination, reduced pinprick sensation in bilateral hands and feets, power in all 4 limbs is 3 to 4 out of 5.  Anal tone is equivocally lax.  No sensory level.  No prior imaging. For MRI whole spine without and with IV contrast to assess for myelopathy.",USUALLY APPROPRIATE,MRI spine area of interest without and with IV contrast,"1. Relevant information from the patient profile includes:
   - Age: 46 years old
   - Symptoms: Acute onset of numbness and tingling in all 4 limbs, uncoordinated movements, difficulty controlling continence
   - Previous diagnosis: Systemic lupus erythematosus
   - Stage of diagnosis: Initial imaging for suspected myelopathy

2. According to the context provided, for acute onset myelopathy, initial imaging with MRI spine area of interest without and with IV contrast is usually appropriate. This is also supported by the information that MRI is useful for evaluation of the spinal cord when investigating the etiology of acute myelopathy, and it has superior soft-tissue resolution and multiplanar capability, making it ideal for evaluation of the spinal canal and its contents as well as the surrounding osseous and soft-tissue structures.

3. There are no superior imaging procedures or treatments with a more favorable risk-benefit ratio mentioned in the context.

"73 year old Indian male, with history of end stage diabetic nephropathy on haemodialysis. Complains of lower back pain for the past 2 months with occasional night pain. Associated with radicular pain of left lower limb. no fever. Physical exam reveals mild tenderness at L3-L4 region but otherwise unremarkable. No prior imaging. MRI lumbar spine without and with IV contrast for possible spondylodiscitis.",MAY BE APPROPRIATE,MRI lumbar spine without IV contrast,"1. Relevant information from the patient profile includes the patient's age (73 years old), symptoms (lower back pain for the past 2 months with occasional night pain, radicular pain of left lower limb), and previous diagnosis (end stage diabetic nephropathy on haemodialysis). This is the initial imaging for this patient's condition.

2. According to the reference information, the patient's profile aligns with the description of ""Low back pain with or without radiculopathy. One or more of the following: suspicion of cancer, infection, or immunosuppression. Initial imaging."" The patient's diabetic nephropathy and haemodialysis treatment suggest a state of immunosuppression, and the ordered scan is for possible spondylodiscitis, which is an infection.

3. The reference information suggests that an MRI lumbar spine without and with IV contrast is usually appropriate for this patient's condition. However, given the patient's end stage renal disease and the need for haemodialysis, the use of IV contrast may pose a risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Therefore, an MRI without IV contrast may be a superior imaging procedure with a more favorable risk-benefit ratio.

4. Based on the scoring criteria, the ordered scan of an MRI lumbar spine without and with IV contrast may be appropriate given the patient's condition. However, considering the patient's renal condition and the potential risks associated with IV contrast, an MRI lumbar spine without IV contrast would be usually appropriate and safer for this patient.",UNA,,,,,
"70 year old Malay male. History of diabetes, hyperlipidemia and hypertension. Worsening neck pain for past 6 months, no radiculopathy or night pain. No recent trauma. Clinical exam reveals mild midline tenderness over the cervical spine with limited range of motion, but no focal neurological deficit. MRI cervical spine without IV contrast for initial examination. ",MAY BE APPROPRIATE,Radiography cervical spine,"1. Relevant information from the patient profile includes: 
   - Age: 70 years old
   - Symptoms: Worsening neck pain for the past 6 months, no radiculopathy or night pain
   - Previous diagnosis: Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension
   - Stage of diagnosis: Initial imaging
   - Other relevant information: No recent trauma, mild midline tenderness over the cervical spine with limited range of motion, but no focal neurological deficit.

2. Referring to the reference information given under CONTEXT, the patient's condition aligns with the description: ""Chronic cervical or neck pain. Initial imaging.""

3. According to the table under this description, an MRI cervical spine without IV contrast is categorized as ""May Be Appropriate (Disagreement)"" for initial imaging in chronic cervical or neck pain.

4. Based on the scoring criteria, the scan order of MRI cervical spine without IV contrast for initial examination is ""MAY BE APPROPRIATE"". However, the first-line imaging modality for this condition is Radiography cervical spine, which is categorized as ""Usually Appropriate"".",MBA,,,,,
"60 year old Chinese female. No past medical history.  Left wrist swelling and redness for 1 week. No trauma.  No fever. On examination, left wrist is warm swollen and tender.  No prior imaging. MRI of the left wrist without and with IV contrast for possible septic arthritis.",USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE,"Aspiration of the wrist, possibly under fluoroscopy or US guidance, followed by analysis of the aspirate. If further imaging is needed after aspiration, MRI with IV contrast may be considered.","1. Relevant information from the patient profile includes: 
   - Age: 60 years old
   - Symptoms: Left wrist swelling and redness for 1 week, no trauma, no fever, wrist is warm, swollen, and tender
   - Previous diagnosis: None
   - Stage of diagnosis: Initial imaging

2. According to the reference information, the patient's symptoms suggest a possible infection in the wrist. The context suggests that in cases of suspected septic arthritis, percutaneous aspiration of the wrist is indicated, even when radiographs appear normal. Aspirates should be analyzed by cell count, gram stain, and appropriate cultures. Aspiration can be performed without imaging guidance if the joint is distended, but either fluoroscopy or US may be useful if a specific compartment is to be targeted. 

3. There may be a role for MRI with IV contrast enhancement in the staging of infections (for example, to delineate the location and extent of soft-tissue abscesses) after aspiration has been performed. Especially in chronic cases, MRI with IV contrast may be useful to identify a fluid collection or joint effusion to target for aspiration. However, MRI is usually not appropriate as the next study after radiographs for suspected wrist infections.

4. Based on the scoring criteria, the scan order of MRI of the left wrist without and with IV contrast for possible septic arthritis is USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE as the initial imaging study. The appropriate procedure would be to perform an aspiration of the wrist, possibly under fluoroscopy or US guidance, followed by analysis of the aspirate. If further imaging is needed after aspiration, MRI with IV contrast may be considered.",UNA,X-ray left wrist,,,,
