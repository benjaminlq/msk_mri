"73 year old Indian male, with history of end stage diabetic nephropathy on haemodialysis. Complains of lower back pain for the past 2 months with occasional night pain. Associated with radicular pain of left lower limb. no fever. Physical exam reveals mild tenderness at L3-L4 region but otherwise unremarkable. No prior imaging. MRI lumbar spine without and with IV contrast for possible spondylodiscitis.",USUALLY APPROPRIATE,,"1. Relevant information from the patient profile includes:
   - Age: 73 years old
   - Symptoms: Lower back pain for the past 2 months with occasional night pain, radicular pain of left lower limb
   - Previous diagnosis: End stage diabetic nephropathy on haemodialysis
   - Stage of diagnosis: Initial imaging (no prior imaging)
   - Other relevant information: Mild tenderness at L3-L4 region, no fever

2. According to the reference information, the patient's profile fits into the category of ""Low back pain with or without radiculopathy. One or more of the following: suspicion of cancer, infection, or immunosuppression. Initial imaging."" This is due to the patient's immunosuppressed state from end stage diabetic nephropathy on haemodialysis and the suspicion of infection (possible spondylodiscitis).

3. The reference information suggests that for this category, the following imaging procedures are recommended:
   - MRI lumbar spine without and with IV contrast: Usually Appropriate
   - MRI lumbar spine without IV contrast: Usually Appropriate
   - Radiography lumbar spine: May Be Appropriate (Disagreement)
   - CT lumbar spine with IV contrast: May Be Appropriate
   - CT lumbar spine without IV contrast: May Be Appropriate
   - CT myelography lumbar spine: May Be Appropriate

4. Based on the scoring criteria, the ordered scan (MRI lumbar spine without and with IV contrast) is USUALLY APPROPRIATE for this patient. However, considering the patient's end stage renal disease and the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis associated with gadolinium-based contrast agents, it would be safer to perform an MRI lumbar spine without IV contrast, which is also classified as USUALLY APPROPRIATE.",UNA,,1,1,OK,LLM quoted a different guideline variant (ACR low back pain variant 7 but both are appropriate)
"70 year old Malay male. History of diabetes, hyperlipidemia and hypertension. Worsening neck pain for past 6 months, no radiculopathy or night pain. No recent trauma. Clinical exam reveals mild midline tenderness over the cervical spine with limited range of motion, but no focal neurological deficit. MRI cervical spine without IV contrast for initial examination. ",MAY BE APPROPRIATE,Radiography cervical spine,"1. Relevant information from the patient profile includes: 
   - Age: 70 years old
   - Symptoms: Worsening neck pain for the past 6 months, no radiculopathy or night pain
   - Previous diagnosis: Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension
   - Stage of diagnosis: Initial imaging
   - Other relevant information: No recent trauma, mild midline tenderness over the cervical spine with limited range of motion, but no focal neurological deficit

2. According to the context provided, for chronic cervical or neck pain without radiculopathy, the appropriateness of different imaging procedures are as follows:
   - MRI cervical spine without IV contrast: May Be Appropriate (Disagreement)
   - Radiography cervical spine: Usually Appropriate
   - CT cervical spine without IV contrast: Usually Not Appropriate

3. Given the patient's profile, there are no superior imaging procedures or treatments with a more favorable risk-benefit ratio mentioned in the context.

4. Based on the scoring criteria, the ordered scan, MRI cervical spine without IV contrast, is classified as ""May Be Appropriate"" for initial imaging in a patient with chronic neck pain without radiculopathy. However, radiography of the cervical spine is usually the more appropriate initial imaging study for this condition.",MBA,,1,1,G,"LLM quoted a different guideline variant (ACR cervical neck pain or cervical radiculopathy variant 7), but the better variant is 1.

"60 year old Chinese female. No past medical history.  Left wrist swelling and redness for 1 week. No trauma.  No fever. On examination, left wrist is warm swollen and tender.  No prior imaging. MRI of the left wrist without and with IV contrast for possible septic arthritis.",USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE,"Aspiration of the wrist, possibly guided by fluoroscopy or US. If aspiration confirms infection, then MRI with IV contrast may be considered to further delineate the extent of the infection.","1. Relevant information from the patient profile includes: 
   - Age: 60 years old
   - Symptoms: Left wrist swelling and redness for 1 week, no trauma, no fever, wrist is warm, swollen, and tender
   - Previous diagnosis: None
   - Stage of diagnosis: Initial imaging

2. According to the reference information given under the context, the patient's symptoms suggest a possible infection in the wrist. The context suggests that in cases of suspected septic arthritis, percutaneous aspiration of the wrist is indicated, even when radiographs appear normal. Aspirates should be analyzed by cell count, gram stain, and appropriate cultures. Aspiration can be performed without imaging guidance if the joint is distended, but either fluoroscopy or US may be useful if a specific compartment is to be targeted. 

3. There may be a role for MRI with IV contrast enhancement in the staging of infections (for example, to delineate the location and extent of soft-tissue abscesses) after aspiration has been performed. Especially in chronic cases, MRI with IV contrast may be useful to identify a fluid collection or joint effusion to target for aspiration. However, MRI is usually not appropriate as the next study after radiographs for suspected wrist infections.

4. Based on the scoring criteria, the scan order of MRI of the left wrist without and with IV contrasts is USUALLY NOT APPROPRIATE as the initial imaging for this patient. The appropriate initial procedure would be aspiration of the wrist, possibly guided by fluoroscopy or US. If aspiration confirms infection, then MRI with IV contrast may be considered to further delineate the extent of the infection.",UNA,X-ray left wrist,0.5,0.5,H,"LLM did not quote a specific ACR guideline, but has understandable reasoning.
